WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

1. **System Logs:**
   - Time changes logged by the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service indicate regular system time updates. The Time Source was `time.windows.com`, which is a standard NTP service. No malicious time tampering is evident.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple events related to the Security Auditing point to time adjustments, which align with the System logs. The `svchost.exe` process handling these actions is typical, as it's a system process responsible for running services. No suspicious usage of this process is detected here.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The Windows Defender is running, and event IDs related to it only indicate security product state checks and confirmations, which is benign behavior. EdgeUpdate-related entries suggest auto-updates for Microsoft Edge, with no signs of tampering.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Basic process execution events are recorded, notably involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, both being legitimate system processes. A `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` execution are observed; these are administration-related utilities and appear to have been executed under a user named `admin_test`.
   - The initiation of the `powershell.exe` with the command indicating a download and execution of a remote script from GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/...`) is highly concerning. This is a direct sign of potentially harmful behavior, as PowerShell is often used by attackers to download and execute malicious scripts. The command involved `iex(new-object net.webclient)...`, indicating an attempt to fetch and likely execute code directly from the web.
   
5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - These logs corroborate the Sysmon logs, showing that a PowerShell session was started with the intention to fetch and execute code from a remote script repository. This behavior is highly suspicious, given it provides a means for remote code execution without sufficient oversight.

### Assessment and Threats Identified

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The use of PowerShell to download and run scripts from an external source is a common tactic in post-exploitation activities. This action can be a precursor to further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
  
- **Threats and Risks:**
  - This behavior indicates a risk of system compromise and possible exfiltration of data, command, and control activities by malicious actors. The lack of context around the script hosted externally suggests this could be part of a larger attack chain or unauthorized software installation.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the potential risk that this activity poses, immediate actions should be taken:
1. Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with any malicious infrastructure.
2. Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to analyze what the remotely executed script has done, including any modifications to system configurations, data access, or persistence mechanisms.
3. Examine network logs to identify any inbound or outbound communications to/from unknown or suspicious IP addresses that could indicate a Command and Control server.
4. Assess other systems for similar activities, as this could be part of a larger-scale intrusion.
5. Update all relevant security systems (endpoint protection, IDS/IPS) with indicators from this incident to enhance monitoring across the network for similar activities or patterns. 

In light of this assessment, further monitoring, and possibly a coordinated incident response, should be considered."
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest emerge, particularly regarding potential malicious activity centered on PowerShell usage.

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to fetch a file from `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm` and store it in the `TEMP` directory as `PhishingAttachment.xlsm`. The use of external URLs to download files via PowerShell can be indicative of malicious activity, particularly since the file is named ""PhishingAttachment.xlsm,"" suggesting a potential phishing attempt or a means of delivering a payload.
   - PowerShell execution is often leveraged by attackers due to its flexibility and integration with Windows systems, making these logs suspicious.

2. **Sysmon and Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While the use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` isn't inherently suspicious, they are tools that can be used to manage or query event logs and interact with command-line interfaces, which may indicate enumeration or log tampering.
   - The presence of high-integrity level operations and usage of PowerShell by the same user (indicated by `admin_test`) raises a red flag, as this account could have elevated privileges and be used maliciously.

3. **Network Activity:**
   - There are several logs that could imply network configuration or system time synchronization, such as `svchost.exe` process activities associated with time adjustments and NTP communications. These are generally benign unless correlated with other malicious activities, which in this scenario, is not evident directly but in combination with the PowerShell download, suggest potential risky behavior.

4. **Edge Update Entries:**
   - Routine operations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related installers are observed, which seem consistent with updating the browser. These do not directly suggest malicious activity unless connected to another malicious process. The usage and execution appear automated and consistent with typical update behavior.

### Assessment

Considering the points above, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The main area of concern is the PowerShell usage to download a file from an external source with a file name suggesting phishing. The combination of scripting to manage or acquire potential payloads via PowerShell is common in cyber attacks, particularly phishing or spear-phishing campaigns. The use of typical administrative tools under a high-privilege account for unusual tasks may compound this suspicion.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis and potential risk, the appropriate resolution for these logs is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - While there is no definitive evidence of compromise, the indicators such as PowerShell downloading potential phishing attachments warrant further investigation. The system should be monitored closely, and the downloaded file should be analyzed for malicious content. Additionally, user activities around the time of the event should be reviewed, and network communications should be scrutinized to ensure no further malicious actions occur."
Create local account with admin privileges,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security channels, several activities indicate potential malicious behavior. Here are the key observations:

#### System Logs
1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events with EventID 24 and 1 from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` indicate the system time was changed several times in a short period. The `ProcessName` involved is `svchost.exe`. Although `svchost.exe` is a legitimate process, altering system time could indicate tampering usually leveraged by attackers to evade detection by altering timestamps on events.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Unexpected Command Execution:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions do not themselves imply maliciousness, but often serve as reconnaissance activities when executed unexpectedly.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` indicates manipulation of event logs, possibly to clear or stealthily manage logs.
   
2. **Suspicious Use of `cmd.exe`:**
   - A command executed via `cmd.exe` as seen in EventID 1 involved creating a new user `art-test` with administrative privileges (`net localgroup administrators art-test /add`). This is alarming as it indicates unauthorized user creation and privilege escalation.
   
3. **Chained Use of `net.exe` and `net1.exe`:**
   - These commands are typically used for user and group management, and their chained usage as observed aligns with attempts to create and elevate a user account.

#### Security Logs
1. **Privilege Escalation and New User Account:**
   - Security events indicate the creation and elevation of a user `art-test`, consistent with activities seen in Sysmon logs involving `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe`.
   - Event ID 4720 (account creation) and 4724 (password reset) executed by `admin_test` corroborate unauthorized actions.

2. **Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows `admin_test` receiving a host of privileges, which are potential red flags if not a routine privileged operation.

### Assessment

The logs clearly indicate unauthorized and potentially malicious activities, specifically around user account creation and privilege escalation unauthorized by security policies:

1. **Account Manipulation and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Creation of a new user `art-test` with elevated privileges without clear legitimate justification strongly indicates a compromise or an attack in progress aimed at maintaining persistence.

2. **Logs and Time Manipulation:**
   - Time adjustments and potential log manipulations suggest efforts to obfuscate activities.

### Resolution

The behavior observed in the event logs can be categorized as **MALICIOUS** since it clearly shows actions consistent with unauthorized access and alteration of user permissions normally considered indicators of compromise.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disable the newly created user `art-test` and reset any associated credentials.
   - Review the permissions and recent activities of the `admin_test` account to ensure no further unauthorized changes have been made.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine how the malicious activity was initiated.
   - Examine if similar activities have occurred across other systems within the network environment.

3. **Strengthening Security Posture:**
   - Implement robust monitoring and alerting on user account modifications, particularly focusing on privileged account usage.
   - Regularly review security logs for any indications of unauthorized access or time manipulation activities."
Activate Guest Account,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### **Suspicious Behavior Identified**
1. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Net User Commands**:
   - Several instances of `cmd.exe` being invoked with the command `net user guest /active:yes` were observed. This command is used to enable the 'Guest' user account on a Windows system. Typically, the 'Guest' account is disabled by default due to security concerns as it provides limited audit and control over actions performed by this user. The enabling of this account without clear administrative approval could be a sign of an attempted privilege escalation or unauthorized access setup.

2. **Process Activities under High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes related to the `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` commands were all executed under a high-integrity level by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, indicating they were likely run with administrative privileges. High integrity can allow significant changes to the system state, further heightening security risk.

3. **Logs Indicating Account Modifications**:
   - Specifically, Security Events 4722 and 4738 show the 'Guest' account being enabled and modified by `admin_test`, concurrent with the execution of suspicious net commands. This is a clear indicator of potential malicious administrative activity.

#### **Noteworthy Context from Logs**:
- **Presence of Known Administrative User**:
  - User `SERVER002\admin_test` is consistently noted as the actor in this activity. The use of legitimate accounts in malicious actions is a common technique to bypass simple security checks.

- **Edge Update Process**:
  - Numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge updates are present. These do not appear suspicious, as Microsoft Edge routinely updates itself and these processes are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

#### **Assessment of the Situation**
- **Threat Identification**: The specific set of processes involving the enabling of the 'Guest' account signifies a potential security risk. Great caution should be exercised, given that an account with minimal oversight may be used to hide further malicious activities.
  
- **Risk Level**: High. Enabling the 'Guest' account without a legitimate reason or logged intent can expose the system to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

### Resolution and Recommendation:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

#### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Disable the Guest Account**: Ensure the 'Guest' account is disabled immediately.
   - **Audit Privileged User Activity**: Conduct an in-depth audit of activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` and any other accounts with administrative privileges recently.
   - **Check for Signs of Compromise**: Inspect the system for any residual or tentatively planted malicious software or scripts, especially in commonly attacked areas like startup entries, task schedulers, or auto-run registries.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - **Review Recent Administrative Logins**: Examine login records to verify any unusual login patterns outside regular hours or from remote locations.
   - **Network Monitoring**: Closely monitor network traffic for any suspicious or unauthorized connections.

3. **Strengthening Security Posture**:
   - **Implement Monitoring Solutions**: Set up security and intrusion detection systems to alert on changes to critical accounts and configurations.
   - **User Awareness**: Brief all users, especially those with admin access, about ongoing security practices and the importance of rejecting unexpected privilege escalation requests or notifications.

Implementing these steps helps assure containment and the prevention of future incidents, while initiating incident response processes can capture and remediate existing security weaknesses timely."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"After analyzing the provided event logs from various sources (Windows PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs), here is the assessment of the activities logged:

### Analysis

#### 1. **Sysmon and Security Logs**
- **Creation and Modification of User Accounts:**
  - The logs indicate the use of the Windows command line (`cmd.exe`) to execute a series of commands that enable the `Guest` user, set a password, and add the `Guest` user to the `Administrators` and `Remote Desktop Users` groups. This is a significant indicator of potential privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
  - Event IDs 4798, 4722, 4738, and 4732 in the Security log document the user account manipulation, confirming these actions.

- **Registry Modifications:**
  - Commands were executed to modify registry settings, particularly related to Terminal Server, which could enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This is often associated with preparing a system for remote exploitation or unauthorized remote administration.

#### 2. **System and Application Logs**
- **Time Change Events:**
  - There are multiple events related to time changes. Changing system time can be a tactic to manipulate timestamp evidence of illicit activities. Although these events alone are not definitive indicators of compromise, they add to the suspicion when correlated with other activities.

- **Edge Update Activities:**
  - Multiple events involving Microsoft Edge updates can be observed, but they appear to be standard update processes unless correlated with known vulnerabilities or exploitation attempts, which is not evident here.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the logs, the observed activity shows clear indicators of:
- Unauthorized user account manipulation and privilege escalation.
- Registry edits to enable potentially hazardous system configurations (remote access).

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or dissemination of malicious activities.
  - Conduct a full malware and security audit of the affected host.
  - Review and modify credentials, especially for accounts that were manipulated or potentially exposed.
  
- **Future Prevention:**
  - Implement stringent monitoring of user account creation and changes, especially for privileged groups.
  - Employ Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to detect unusual command-line activity and unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
  - Regularly update systems and patch vulnerabilities that may be exploited by threat actors. 

Overall, this activity is consistent with an attacker attempting to escalate privileges and potentially establish persistence or further access to a network environment. Prompt remediation and investigation will be crucial in addressing this security incident."
Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Commands**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate suspicious activity involving the downloading and execution of a script from a URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`.
   - The script further attempts to execute code designed to create and write to a file `C:\\Users\\Public\\art.jse`, which appears to be scripting commands related to network or system interaction (indicative of potentially malicious activity).

2. **Security Audit Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` were used by the SYSTEM account, which can indicate potential misuse if not expected.
   - Several Event ID 5379 entries show attempts to acquire credentials for a Microsoft account or Windows Live ID, which failed (ReturnCode `3221226021` - STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION). Repeated attempts to retrieve credentials may indicate unauthorized access attempts.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
   - Various system processes related to Microsoft Edge Update run multiple times, which is typical for legitimate software updates. However, it is essential to ensure these updates are from trusted sources.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes, which might coincide with legitimate updates if scheduled around that time.
   - However, the PowerShell execution without a known reason and the subsequent chain of actions (like creating .jse files and network pinging) in the context of a potential script injection scenario is highly suspect.

### Assessment:
- The PowerShell events are the most significant indicators of potentially malicious activity. The download and execution of external scripts can lead to a system compromise, especially if these scripts are not from a trusted source.
- The attempts to access and utilize privileged account credentials (unsuccessfully) could imply probing attempts or potential lateral movement by an attacker trying to gather sensitive information or elevate privileges.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs, particularly the PowerShell script execution from an unauthorized source and attempts to manipulate system-level processes, these logs strongly indicate malicious activity.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Quarantine or isolate the affected host to prevent potential spread or execution of the malicious script further.
   - Investigate the source and intent of the potentially malicious PowerShell script and consider contacting legal or cybersecurity entities if necessary.

2. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Enforce strict PowerShell execution policies and consider using AppLocker or another application whitelisting service.
   - Conduct thorough forensic analysis to uncover any changes or persistence mechanisms possibly set by the scripts.
   - Review and strengthen credential management policies, ensuring multi-factor authentication and monitoring failed login attempts.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**:

   - Review and update the permissions and security policies around high-privilege accounts to minimize exposure to similar threats in the future."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"In the provided logs, the key indicators of potential malicious activity are highlighted primarily in the Sysmon log. These logs reveal several events of interest:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of PowerShell (Process ID 5732) is often worth investigating as it can be used for legitimate administrative tasks as well as malicious activities, such as executing scripts to download and run malware. Here, it is run by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Without additional command-line details, it is difficult to definitively categorize this as malicious, but it should be noted.

2. **Cmd.exe with Suspicious Command:**
   - A command-line instance of `cmd.exe` (Process ID 6892) executes a suspicious command `copy %%temp%%\\ExplorerSync.db %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db & schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr ""javaw -jar %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db"" /sc MINUTE /f`.
   - Creating a scheduled task (`schtasks`) that executes a `.db` file with `javaw -jar` is highly unusual, especially when it references directories within a temp folder structure. This behavior is indicative of a potentially malicious scheduled task setup, possibly related to persistence mechanisms common in certain types of malware.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` being run by the same user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While these might be used for system administration, their frequency in this short timeframe, particularly around the same timestamp, can be suspicious. However, they do not in themselves confirm malicious activity without further context.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs contain a high volume of activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes. While this can be a normal background activity for updating the browser, the context of the other logs (PowerShell usage and suspicious cmd.exe commands) warrants a deeper investigation into whether these activities have been manipulated or altered.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators that point towards potentially suspicious activity, particularly the scheduled task setup via `cmd.exe`, combined with PowerShell execution and numerous usages of system utilities. These factors need closer examination to rule out or confirm malicious intent.

### Guidance:
- Inspect the command-line usage more closely to verify the purpose and contents of `ExplorerSync.db` in the command executed by `cmd.exe`.
- Capture and analyze network communication related to the Edge Update process to check for unusual patterns.
- Review more logs and any correlated network or endpoint detection data to determine the intention and origin of the suspicious commands.
- Consider monitoring or conducting endpoint forensic analysis to identify any dropped or executed files by these processes."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"Based on the provided logs from the Windows host, the following analysis highlights potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are present in both Security and System logs (`EventID 1102` and `EventID 104`). This is often an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious activities. 
   - The logs show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, executed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The presence of `PSEXESVC.exe` service being installed and executed (`EventID 7045`) is notable. PsExec is a legitimate administrative tool, but it is frequently used by malicious actors to execute code remotely.
   - The command-line usage of `PsExec` (`PsExec.exe -accepteula -s %%COMSPEC%% /c whoami`) in Sysmon logs further suggests unauthorized remote execution with elevated privileges.

3. **High-Privilege Commands:**
   - The cmd.exe command execution by admin_test involving PsExec reflects a typical privilege escalation attempt, especially paired with subsequent log clearance commands.
   - Privilege assignments event (`EventID 4672`) logs showing extensive privileges being granted are typically suspicious in high-security environments.

4. **Automatic Account Enumeration:**
   - The enumeration of user accounts as seen in multiple `EventID 4798` logs is often associated with reconnaissance activities, which could indicate preparations for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

5. **System and TaskHost Executions:**
   - Execution of specific Microsoft tools such as `wevtutil.exe` for logging and clearing, `taskhostw.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments can be used as evidence of scripted and potentially automated malware behavior.

Based on this analysis, the logs contain several activities that are known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Activity includes log clearing, suspicious execution of administrative tools, execution of high-privilege commands, and account enumeration without a preceding legitimate administrative task.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected host(s) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized activity.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional signs of compromise or associated artifacts not covered in logs.

WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - powerhell kittie,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Logs Analysis:**
   - The logs indicate multiple PowerShell events being triggered on the host Server002. 
   - Notably, the command being executed in PowerShell involves downloading a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/.../script.ps1`) and executing it using `iex` (Invoke-Expression), which is a common technique used in malicious activities to execute remote scripts.
   - The usage of `obfuskittiedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive` suggests the script involved could potentially obfuscate its operations, which is suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like 'wevtutil.exe' and 'conhost.exe' occurs, associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 'wevtutil.exe' is being executed multiple times, which might suggest attempts to tamper or read event logs, a behavior seen in malicious activities.
   - There is a record of PowerShell being launched from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which can be a legitimate or malicious use case depending on context; however, the accompanying PowerShell actions look suspicious.
   - The logs also capture a high integrity level for many processes linked to this user, indicating potential privilege escalation or execution of high-privileged tasks.

3. **Security Logs Analysis:**
   - There's a logon event with full privileges (EventID 4672) for the `admin_test` user immediately preceding potentially suspicious activities. This could suggest necessary permissions being granted for those activities, including privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege, which are potent if misused.
   - Event ID 4634 indicates a logoff event, which could be intended to cover tracks after the execution of scripts or unauthorized activity.

4. **System and Application Logs Analysis:**
   - Time discrepancy events were noted (EventID 1) linked to `svchost.exe`, which consistently happens just before suspicious activities occur. Adjusting system time can sometimes be a strategy to confuse or manipulate log timestamps.
   - Processes linked to normal system updates, like Microsoft Edge updates, seem consistent and legitimate under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. 

**Assessment:**
- Given the evidence from the PowerShell and Sysmon logs indicating remote script execution from an unknown, potentially unauthorized source, along with the unusual frequency of event utility executions and privilege escalation events, it is highly indicative of **malicious** activity.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** The activity involves suspicious script execution from an external source, potential privilege abuse, and log tampering elements, suggesting a compromise with unauthorized malicious intent.

USB Malware Spread Simulation,"Based on the log entries provided, here is a detailed analysis:

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **Suspicious Command Execution**: The PowerShell logs show a script that identifies removable drives and creates a file named `dataTest1.txt` on each drive. The content of the file indicates a simulation of malware spread. This behavior is highly suspicious as it resembles tactics used by malware to distribute itself through removable media.
   - The command executed is using `Get-WmiObject` to identify drives of type 2 (removable).
   - The `New-Item` command is used to create a file on these drives forcibly.
   - This activity suggests a potential attempt to spread a script or malware via USB drives, which is a common vector for such attacks.

### System Logs:
1. **Regular Updates and Time Syncs**: There are standard operating system events, such as a Microsoft Defender Antivirus update (`EventID: 19`) and NTP time synchronization (`EventID: 35`). 
   - These events do not exhibit any unusual behavior indicative of a compromise, indicating that updates and time syncs, while efficient, might be misused in the context of time-stamping actions.

### Application Logs:
1. **Defender Status**: The logs indicate that Windows Defender is operational (`EventID: 15`), which is a component of normal, expected behavior for system security.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation**: Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed, along with `powershell.exe`.
   - `powershell.exe` is specifically involved with the suspicious script mentioned earlier. The Sysmon log confirms the execution of this malicious-looking PowerShell command.
   - All these processes are run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, showing intent and potential misuse by someone with administrative-level access. The integrity level is high, indicating high-level privileges being possibly misused.

### Security Logs:
1. **Time Changes**: Logs show multiple time change events, which are generally associated with regular system synchronization. However, since these events occur around the execution of suspicious scripts, they could potentially be used to alter logs or hide particular activities if manipulated under malicious intent.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
- The activities observed in the PowerShell logs are indicative of malicious activity, especially the script designed to create files on removable drives. This behavior is consistent with tactics used by malware to propagate through USB devices. Additionally, the combination of PowerShell execution and high-integrity processes strengthens the inference of potential misuse or compromise.
- As such, this analysis concludes with the resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that strongly suggests malicious intent, specifically through the automatic creation of suspicious files on removable drives using PowerShell scripts. Immediate attention and containment actions should be undertaken, including auditing user activity, inspecting involved removable drives for the presence of unauthorized files, and employing enhanced monitoring or restrictions on PowerShell script execution."
Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell execution events captured, containing the execution of a script that performs the following actions:
     - Uses `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`, which is usually suspicious as it involves handling of plain text passwords.
     - Establishes an Azure account connection using `Connect-AzAccount -Credential $creds`.
     - Creates an Azure Automation Runbook with `New-AzAutomationRunbook`.

   This PowerShell activity, especially involving the manipulation of secure credentials and interaction with Azure, is indicative of automated tasks or scripts potentially being run, possibly without proper oversight or authorization. This can be an indicator of an attempt to move laterally within a cloud environment.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are several instances where processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and can be used maliciously for activities such as clearing logs.
   - The PowerShell execution observed in the Sysmon Logs aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity in the PowerShell logs.

3. **General Observations**:
   - There is multiple use of `conhost.exe` which typically is a legitimate host for console applications, but its frequent repeated invocation alongside other suspicious processes could be indicative of automation or script-driven attacks.
   - The events mostly involve a specific user `admin_test`, suggesting that this account might be compromised or involved in unauthorized activities.
   - The logs don't show clear evidence of privilege escalation but the level of access (`IntegrityLevel=High`) suggests significant access rights.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The PowerShell script handling plain text passwords alongside automated Azure operations is suspicious.
- The frequent and script-like invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell by the `admin_test` user is not typical user behavior and suggests automation or exploitation.

Given the findings, the activities within these logs are classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity doesn't appear outright malicious but indicates unusual and potentially problematic behavior that requires further investigation focusing on:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account activity and ensuring its credentials are not compromised.
- Reviewing the intent and authorization for the PowerShell script's operations involving Azure.
- Monitoring and potentially restricting the use of `wevtutil.exe` and Powershell scripting by standard users on this system.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activities.
- Validate the PowerShell script’s purpose and evaluate risk related to Azure operations.
- Implement security measures: enhance logging, apply least privilege principles, and consider using application whitelisting tools like AppLocker to restrict unauthorized execution of scripts.
- Review and monitor Azure activity logs for unusual interactions or configurations."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"### Analysis

Upon review of the provided logs from different sources, several activities stand out which warrant further investigation:

1. **Privilege Use & System Activities:**
   - There are several instances of Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon). The privileges include powerful capabilities like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are typically assigned to system accounts and could indicate potential misuse if associated with unauthorized accounts.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate a script executing operations such as creating registry items under Chrome's extension path and attempting to control Chrome using automated processes.
   - The PowerShell command line includes adding extensions with specific IDs and forcefully making registry changes, followed by launching and stopping Chrome. This activity is generally associated with malicious behavior aimed at installing unauthorized extensions or altering browser functionality.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of the described PowerShell activities by a user `admin_test`. This particular activity includes modifying registry keys related to Google Chrome extensions, which aligns with potentially malicious behavior observed in threats like browser hijacking or unauthorized extension installation.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` and follow-up commands to manipulate applications/processes further corroborates with pop-up induced scripts and malvertisement attempts on Windows hosts.

4. **Other Assorted Application/System Logs:**
   - Various system and security logs describe typical system activities like task scheduling, service starts, and system telemetry, which do not immediately indicate malicious behavior.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The creation of registry entries related to Chrome extensions and forced execution of starting and stopping Chrome suggests potential malicious behavior. While this could be a legitimate script intended for IT management purposes, without explicit authorization or context, it needs deeper analysis. Additionally, if these extensions are known malicious ones, they could lead to browser-based attacks.

- **Privilege Utilization:** Although the occurrence of Ticket ID 4672 is often benign when associated with system processes, consideration should be given to the context in which they are assigned, especially combined with suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate suspicious behavior that requires further investigation. It is recommended to:
- **Verify the legitimacy** of the PowerShell scripts and extensions being added to Google Chrome.
- **Conduct a thorough review** of user `admin_test` activities to confirm if these actions are legitimate or unauthorized.
- **Inspect Chrome Extensions IDs** (`fcfhplploccackoneaefokcmbjfbkenj`, `fdcgdnkidjaadafnichfpabhfomcebme`) to ascertain if they are recognized and safe.
- **Verify privilege assignments** and ensure they follow company policy.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and possibly trigger alerts for similar actions in the future if deemed necessary."
