Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

### Overview:
The provided logs initiate from a Windows Sysmon source, focusing predominantly on `Process Create` (EventID: 1) and `Process Termination` (EventID: 5). Security logs and PowerShell activity logs are also part of the provided data. The focus is to assess any suspicious activities such as unexpected process executions, particularly ones that could indicate malicious activity like the use of Windows PowerShell for potentially unauthorized tasks, privilege escalation, or anomalous patterns involving critical processes.

### Observations:

1. **System Monitoring with Sysmon:**

   - **PowerShell and Conhost Activity:**
     - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate application, its misuse for scripting can be a red flag, particularly when mixed with command line chaining.
     - Processes `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are consistently appearing, tied to session activity of the user `admin_test`. While these are common Windows processes, if used improperly, they can contribute to unauthorized data collection or system changes. 

   - **Wevtutil Usage:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` is used several times, notably on 2024-10-26 around 19:28:21 through 19:28:22. This utility can be used for event log management and could be used maliciously to clear event logs.

2. **Command Execution with PowerShell:**

   - The specific PowerShell command:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe' -c '$env:temp\\test.txt'}
     ```
     - The PowerShell command executes another command via the old `cmd.exe` shell, invoking the GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) encryption tool to encrypt a file named `test.txt` in the temp directory. While GPG is used for legitimate purposes like securing data, unauthorized encryption of files is suspicious, particularly without context.

3. **Security Event Logs:**

   - Logs show repeated queries (`EventID: 4798`) against different user accounts by the process `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is typically related to Microsoft's telemetry but could indicate anomaly depending on context.
   - Elevated privileges recorded via `EventID: 4672`, showing enhanced security context received by system processes, which is standard but should be matched with expected activity schedules.

4. **Conclusions from Windows PowerShell Log:**

   - Execution logs imply that the PowerShell script or host was configured to run a command that involved shell execution and a subsequent file operation with GPG, indicating potential automation or scheduled task.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:
- The use of PowerShell in executing command line operations to encrypt files can potentially be an indicator of malicious activity if not authorized, as encryption without user consent aligns with certain ransomware behaviors.
- Wevtutil's presence in batch might indicate event log tampering.
- Non-standard processes or unapproved scripts executing on corporate systems could reflect attempts to bypass security measures.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities, namely PowerShell scripting for file encryption and potential event log manipulation, which require further investigation to determine the legitimacy and authorization. Monitoring of PowerShell commands and audit logs around these event timestamps is warranted for confirming the purpose and source of these actions. Verification with system administrators about scheduled tasks or known scripts would provide clarity and help in breach detection."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

"
Windows - vssadmin Resize Shadowstorage Volume,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entry related to ""Software Protection Platform Service"" (EventID 16384) is typical for systems monitoring, without immediately revealing any suspicious activity.

2. **Security Log:**
   - EventID 4624 indicates a successful logon. The logon type is 5, which corresponds to a service logon. This is usual for system processes.
   - EventID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account like ""SeDebugPrivilege"", which are standard for system operations.
   - EventID 4799 shows several instances of processes accessing the ""Administrators"" group. This could be normal for processes like VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) if they are performing legitimate backup operations.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is an entry showing PowerShell initiated with a command to execute `vssadmin resize shadowstorage`. While operations with VSS can be legitimate, they can also be misused to facilitate attacks like hiding malicious activities, but there is no specific indicator here suggesting this usage.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries show typical utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` getting executed by a user account `admin_test`, which is a usual part of system operations and environment checks.
   - Entries for `vssadmin.exe` in command execution are observed, tied to the same PowerShell command seen earlier. This could be routine if an authorized admin needed to manage disk space. Repeated observations of Sysmon EventID 5 show various typical system processes like `svchost.exe`, which is standard and confirms the earlier behavior noted.
   
5. **System Log:**
   - Time service adjustments and kernel event entries are typical for system processes and clocks synchronization.

**Indicators of Compromise:**
- The usage of `vssadmin` is notable, as this command is sometimes used in cyber attacks to delete shadow copies and hinder recovery from ransomware, but here it shows configuring shadow storage, which might suggest space management.

**Assessment:**
- There is no definitive evidence of malicious activity identified within the logs provided. The focus on `vssadmin` command usage signifies an operational change rather than immediate malicious intent.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the operations described are largely in line with standard administrative activity, the nature of the `vssadmin` command warrants further investigation. Verifying that these actions were authorized and necessary with corresponding operational logs or requests can help rule out the potential misuse.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Verification**: Confirm the legitimacy of the `vssadmin` command usage by consulting change management logs or administrative requests.
2. **Access Control Check**: Ensure there are appropriate permissions for processes accessing critical groups like ""Administrators.""
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Keep an eye on similar operations to identify any patterns suggesting misuse.
4. **Audit**: Consider reviewing system and network configurations to ensure security postures are sufficient.

By taking these steps, you can ascertain if these actions were benign maintenance or a precursor to something more sinister."
Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several areas deserve attention due to the possibility of malicious activity or behavior worthy of further scrutiny.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization**:
   - **Event ID 4616** from the Security log indicates a change in the system time. Such logs are benign given they originate from the Windows Time Service, but they can also potentially indicate a tactic used by malware to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps.
   
2. **Spawning of System Processes**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of executions of standard Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These actions could be part of normal administrative activities; however, they may be suspicious if occurring at unusual times or frequencies.

3. **Execution of Command Prompt Commands**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `/c bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no` is highly suspicious. Modifying the boot configuration data to ignore all boot failures (`bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures`) and disable system recovery (`recoveryenabled no`) is a classic tactic of persistence and hindering recovery, often seen in malicious activities.

### Threat/Risk Assessment:
- **Execution of `bcdedit.exe` Commands**: Given the context of modifying boot configurations to disable recovery options, this behavior is indicative of an initial stage of malware aiming to persist through reboots and thwart potential remediation efforts by disabling boot recovery features.

- **Normal Administrative Actions or Malicious Activity?**:
   - While the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could reflect legitimate operations by an administrator checking system information, the context in which `bcdedit.exe` is used suggests a potentially more serious threat. It is crucial to verify the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user and whether these actions align with their typical usage pattern within the network.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Action**: The effect of the `bcdedit.exe` command execution should be reversed. Verify the system's boot configuration via `bcdedit /enum` and manually change settings to reenable recovery options.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct thorough checks into recent user behavior on the `SERVER002` machine, monitor for any unusual network or file-access patterns, and cross-verify with endpoint security solutions for other signs of compromise.
- **User Authentication**: Confirm that the actions performed by `admin_test` were intended and authorized by verifying user credentials and activities.
- **Potential Impact**: The system may be susceptible to resilience against recovery attempts upon future failures, indicating significant interference with system integrity.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The configuration changes made to the boot policies of the system, specifically the commands to ignore boot failures and disable recovery, align with tactics often employed by malicious actors. This behavior mandates immediate response and a comprehensive investigation into the extent of the breach."
Configure LegalNoticeCaption and LegalNoticeText registry keys to display ransom message,"## Log Analysis and Findings

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - A PowerShell process was initiated with the following command:
     ```PowerShell
     powershell.exe & {$orgLegalNoticeCaption = (Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name LegalNoticeCaption).LegalNoticeCaption, $orgLegalNoticeText = (Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name LegalNoticeText).LegalNoticeText, $newLegalNoticeCaption = \""PYSA\"", $newLegalNoticeText = \""Hi Company, every byte on any types of your devices was encrypted. Don't try to use backups because it were encrypted too. To get all your data contact us:xxxx@onionmail.org\"", Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name LegalNoticeCaption -Value $newLegalNoticeCaption -Type String -Force, Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name LegalNoticeText -Value $newLegalNoticeText -Type String -Force}
     ```
   - This command updates the system's legal notice to a ransom message, indicating possible ransomware activity.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Logon Events:**
   - User `admin_test` was involved in several privilege elevation events (`EventID 4672`) with significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.
   - Multiple logon events (`EventID 4624`) using NTLM authentication were observed, suggesting potential misuse of credentials, especially from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), indicating a lateral movement attempt.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of system utilities (`C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`) were observed running under `admin_test`.
   - Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can indicate reconnaissance activity to gather information about the system.

4. **Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update:**
   - A log entry indicates the execution of the Software Protection Platform Service. While not inherently suspicious, its combination with observed malicious activities might suggest attempts to interfere with software licensing or integrity checks.
   - EdgeUpdate events appear normal for update mechanisms but need correlation with other events for comprehensive understanding.

### Assessment

Overall, the logs indicate malicious behavior primarily suggestive of ransomware activity, most likely tied to the PYSA ransomware group, known to use such tactics. The execution of a PowerShell script to alter system legal notice with ransom notes and the involvement of a compromised admin account handling privilege escalations and unauthorized logins highlight a highly compromised state.

Akira Ransomware drop Files with .akira Extension and Ransomnote,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators highly suggest malicious activity on the host machine.

**Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Command Execution (Sysmon and PowerShell Logs):**
   - The logs show multiple invocations of `powershell.exe` with suspicious and malicious intent. 
   - The command line arguments detail creating files with `.akira` extensions and generating a file named `akira_readme.txt` on the desktop, which contains a ransom note. 
   - This is indicative of ransomware activity, with explicit instructions pointing users towards a Tor site for further interactions.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Security Logs):**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates a privilege escalation where the user `admin_test` gained multiple high-level privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. 
   - These privileges, especially `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege`, are often targeted by malicious actors to exploit sensitive functions on Windows systems.

3. **Time Manipulation (System and Security Logs):**
   - System Event ID 1 (from Kernel-General) indicates the system time being reset or manipulated, which is reflected in Security Event ID 4616.
   - Time manipulation can be used by malicious actors to evade detection, especially related to time-based security logs or file timestamps.

4. **Unauthorized External Connection (Security Logs):**
   - Event ID 4624 logs a successful NTLM authentication from an external IP (`192.168.0.102`), which could represent unauthorized access.
   - The use of NTLM authentication with elevated privileges could be another indicator of illicit access or lateral movement within the network.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of common system utilities like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` running closely with PowerShell execution might suggest attempts to blend with legitimate processes or privilege escalation.

**Assessment:**
- These activities indicate the presence of a ransomware attack (Akira as told in the ransom note) on this host.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The identified behaviors, including ransomware footprint, privilege escalation attempts, and signs of illicit access, indicate a malicious incident needing immediate attention.

Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are the observations and analysis:

### Analysis of Sysmon Log:

1. **PowerShell Invocation:**
   - EventRecordID 18002 shows `powershell.exe` execution by `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell usage is common for administrative tasks but can be suspicious if unexplained, particularly if running unexpected scripts.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (EventRecordIDs 18006, 18010, 18014, 18018, 18022) and `conhost.exe` launching (EventRecordIDs 18003, 18007, 18011, 18015, 18019, 18023, etc.) occur in very close succession. While these processes are legitimate Windows processes, their rapid and repetitive invocation could indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs or manage console applications. Context is necessary to determine the reason behind these actions.

3. **Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`:**
   - Instances of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` (EventRecordIDs 18024, 18028) don't inherently signify malicious activity but are often used in enumeration processes. The presence of these commands could suggest the account was used to gather information about the system and the user context.

4. **Cmd.exe Invocation with Suspicious CommandLine:**
   - EventRecordID 18032 includes a `cmd.exe` execution with the CommandLine `""cmd.exe"" /c """"%PROGRAMFILES%\dcrypt""\dcrypt.exe""`. Execution of a potentially unknown program `dcrypt.exe` from the `Program Files` directory raises suspicion, as this could be indicative of downloading or executing malicious payloads.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Several records (EventRecordIDs 18037, 18038, 18041) pertain to `setup.exe` under `Microsoft EdgeUpdate`, indicating likely software updates. The activity appears legitimate, referencing Microsoft Edge Installer, which commonly runs under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Analysis of Security Log:

1. **Security Event ID 4799:**
   - Involves `setup.exe` from EdgeUpdate temporarily modifying a group object pertaining to `Users`. This could be part of normal update procedures that require elevated privileges.

### Conclusion:

- **Benign Processes:** The EdgeUpdate activity appears benign given Microsoft's involvement and system-level operations expected during browser updates.
  
- **Suspicious Activity:** The repeated executions of relatively innocuous system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` suggest possible scripting or task automation by an administrative user, which could warrant further review.
  
- **Malicious Potential:** The `dcrypt.exe` noted within the `cmd.exe` process is the most suspicious element. This name does not correspond to a known or verified legitimate Windows process and could potentially align with cryptographic or malicious payload tools.

In conclusion, the logs exhibit **SUSPICIOUS** behavior, predominantly around cmd.exe’s execution string involving `dcrypt.exe`. Further investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of this file and its place of origin, which includes:
- Verifying `%PROGRAMFILES%\dcrypt\` for any unusual executables or scripts.
- Cross-referencing the hash values with known databases of malicious files.
- Checking for anomalous behavior or changes within the system during the timeframe of these activities."
Windows - wbadmin Delete Windows Backup Catalog,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, the following analysis can be made:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Events related to ""Microsoft-Windows-Backup"" and ""edgeupdate"" services seem benign and typically indicate regular backup and update routines. The entries do not suggest any malicious activity.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Several 4624 (Logon) events, indicating successful logons, originate from the SYSTEM account. The logon type is 5, which is a service logon. These entries do not imply any unusual or suspicious activity.
   - Event 4672 indicates that high privileges were assigned, but they correspond to the SYSTEM account, which is common and expected.
   - Time change events (4616) may appear suspicious at first glance, but analyzing the context shows they might be part of system time synchronization activities due to the regular Windows Time Service operation, and there is no evidence to suggest tampering.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There is repeated execution of `wbadmin` and `wbengine` processes indicating backup operations, followed by deletion of the backup catalog (`wbadmin delete catalog -quiet`). While suspicious command-line operations like the deletion of backup data can be concerning, they might also be routine administrative tasks.
   - Processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are consistent with regular update activities for Microsoft Edge. They do not represent any unauthorized or malicious behavior.
   - The execution of typical maintenance commands like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in the context provided appears consistent with administrative scripting or automated tasks performed by legitimate users (`admin_test`).

4. **Overall Assessment:**
   - The logs do not present definitive malicious activity. While certain commands, such as the deletion of the backup catalog, might warrant further context verification (e.g., checking change logs or administrative notes to ensure these actions were authorized), there are no other clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity.
   - Most activities can be correlated with expected operations of a server experiencing legitimate backup and update processes.

**Conclusion:** The event logs suggest routine server operations with no overt signs of malicious activity. However, due caution should be exercised by verifying the legitimacy of backup catalog deletion via internal protocols or administrator confirmation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - Due to the `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet` command, which should be verified to ensure it was an intended and authorized administrative action. Further investigation or confirmation is advised to rule out any unintended consequences."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, the following observations were made:

### PowerShell Logs:
- There is a PowerShell command executed with the following command line:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}}
  ```
  This command targets the deletion of all shadow copies on the system, which is generally considered a dangerous operation as it can be used to remove backup copies that might be needed for recovery. Malicious parties often use this command to prevent restoration after deploying ransomware or deleting evidence of malicious activity.

### Security and System Logs:
- There are multiple logon events for the user ""admin_test"" using LogonType 3 (network logon), and there are EventID 4672 entries indicating that this account was granted various high-privilege rights, including SeDebugPrivilege, which are sensitive and should be allocated with care.
- There is evidence of the time being changed on the system. Time change events (EventID 4616) can sometimes be used as a tactic to obfuscate log timings or sequence of events.

### Sysmon Logs:
- There are process executions using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are standard Windows tools. However, the context of their use is uncertain. These processes were executed in folders relating to the user ""admin_test"".
- The process `VSSVC.exe` (Volume Shadow Copy Service) is also seen in action potentially related to manipulations of VSS as seen in the PowerShell logs.

### Application Logs:
- The entries are consistent with regular system activities. There is an entry indicative of the Software Protection Platform Service running, which is typical.

### Assessment:
1. **PowerShell actions**: The deletion of shadow copies is highly suspicious. This is a common step performed during or before executing malicious activities such as ransomware attacks, where preventing file recovery is a goal.
2. **Privilege escalation**: The account ""admin_test"" has been granted elevated permissions and is active over network logons. This account's doings need to be scrutinized as it might have been misused.
3. **Time changes**: While not directly malicious, time adjustments on a system can sometimes indicate an attempt to interfere with log generation or timeline creation during forensic analysis.

### Conclusion:
Due to the deletion of shadow copies using PowerShell, the excessive privileges granted to ""admin_test"", and the time manipulation, there are strong indications of potential malicious activity that needs further investigation to confirm if this was a legitimate action by an authorized admin or an unauthorized action by a malicious actor.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that strongly indicates potential malicious behavior. Immediate investigation and response are needed to confirm and respond to any compromise."
Windows - Stop service by killing process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out that suggest potentially anomalous behavior, but do not immediately confirm malicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Application Log:
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stop Events**: Two entries indicate that the `edgeupdate` service stopped at very close intervals. While this might be part of routine operations, frequent stopping and starting can sometimes indicate tampering with update services.

### System Log:
- **Service Control Manager Error (EventID 7031)**: The Print Spooler service is noted to terminate unexpectedly and is configured to restart. This behavior could suggest an issue with the service itself or exploitation attempts, given the known vulnerabilities associated with the print spooler service (e.g., PrintNightmare).

### Sysmon Log:
- **Execution of Command-Line Tools and Processes**:
  - **HOSTNAME.EXE, WHOAMI.EXE, CMD.EXE**: Multiple executions of these benign utilities by a user (admin_test) in rapid succession. While these are standard tools, their use in quick succession, especially the `whoami` command, which checks the current user’s information, and `cmd.exe` involving taskkill for `spoolsv.exe`, presents suspicious behavior often seen in reconnaissance or attempting to alter system configurations.
  - **TASKKILL for spoolsv.exe**: Explicit use of `taskkill` to forcefully terminate the `spoolsv.exe` process is suspicious and requires further investigation. Terminating this process disrupts the service, aligning with the service crash in the system log.

- **EdgeUpdate Executables**: A large volume of entries related to various components of Microsoft Edge Update are executed, primarily indicating update operations. The frequency and nature of these operations do not, in isolation, imply malicious activity but should be mapped against scheduled tasks for confirmation.

### Security Log:
- **Successful Logon and Privilege Use (EventID 4624 and 4672)**:
  - The use of SYSTEM account to obtain elevated privileges for the specified set of privileges aligns with possible system maintenance or planned administrative tasks.

### Summary and Assessment:
- **Suspicious Indicators**:
  - The combination of logs showing frequent service stops (EdgeUpdate), and attempts to terminate processes like `spoolsv.exe` and restart services draws attention to potentially unwanted or unauthorized administrative behavior.
  - The command sequence including the `whoami` command and use of task killing operations requires correlation with known tasks and legitimate administrative actions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the noted activities, while not outright malicious, the events present suspicious behavior that needs further investigation. Specific focus should be on the rationale behind the service terminations and command executions by the `admin_test` user. It is advisable to check for unusual scheduled tasks, external connections, and obtain context from user accounts involved to confirm legitimacy or isolate potential threats."
Windows - Stop service using Service Controller,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as noteworthy for further analysis. Below is a detailed examination of the logs and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Changes (Security and System Logs)**:
   - The Security logs indicate two events (Event ID 4616) related to Audit Policy Change that involve changes to the system time:
     - Time is being set backward (""NewTime"" precedes ""PreviousTime"").
   - This behavior is also corroborated in the System logs with events showing time changes, indicating the system time was altered.

   Typically, unauthorized changes to system time can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate timestamps for logs or avoid detection by security systems. When coupled with other suspicious activities, this can indicate a potential compromise.

2. **Process Executions (Sysmon Log)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes can be normal, their repetitive and rapid execution in concert can point to script usage intended for log reading or system adjustments, particularly `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used for accessing Windows event logs.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `cmd.exe /c sc.exe stop spooler` is observed. This command stops the Print Spooler service and is typically not part of routine operations. Such actions can be a precursor to various attack techniques including disabling certain services to conceal malicious activity or prepare for a Printer Spooler vulnerability exploitation.

3. **Normal Software Updates (Sysmon Log and Application Log)**:
   - Activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components are seen, including installation setups and service updates which are common for maintaining browser updates. These events seem benign as they're consistent with legitimate update operations for Microsoft Edge.

4. **Miscellaneous System Activities**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the `wsmprovhost.exe` process is consistent with system information queries and might not inherently indicate suspicious activity, but could be part of a broader script for reconnaissance or administrative checks.

### Assessment:
The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions coupled with system time changes is highly suspicious and may suggest attempts to hide evidence or conduct unauthorized system access checks. The Prints Spooler service stop via `sc.exe` can potentially suggest malicious intent due to past exploits targeting this service.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The collected logs exhibit a combination of suspicious activities, notably the system time changes, command executions to halt services, and repetitive script-like process executions. I recommend a detailed investigation into the user's activities, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test`, and a security review of recent system access and modifications. This includes verifying the integrity of Powershell logs, reviewing any correlated network activity logs, and conducting endpoint threat analysis to identify possible traces of compromise."
Windows - Delete Backup Files,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest, notably a mix of expected and concerning activities. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Command Execution (Sysmon Events 17976 & 17977):**
   - High-integrity `cmd.exe` execution with a destructive command line (`del /s /f /q c:\*.VHD c:\*.bac c:\*.bak ...`) is highly suspicious. The command tries to delete backup files, which is a typical behavior for ransomware or other destructive malware aimed at removing recovery options.

2. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility that manages Windows event logs, could point to attempts to clear logs, which is a tactic often used to cover tracks post-exploitation.

3. **Integrity and Privilege Levels:**
   - Various processes, including some executing under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, are observed. A shift from user-level to system-level access where high or system integrity processes are executed could indicate privilege escalation or abuse, especially if unexpected by the administrator.

4. **Credential Access Attempts (EventID 5379):**
   - Several failed credential read operations indicate potential unauthorized attempts to access stored credentials. The repeated nature of these attempts could signify aggressive credential dumping or exploration.

5. **Anomalous Services and Backgrounds:**
   - The execution of processes like `RUXIMICS.exe`, `PLUGScheduler.exe`, alongside generic service executions without specific user actions, can represent opportunistic backdoor installation or persistence mechanisms.

### Indicators of Benign Activity:

1. **Edge Updates and System Processes (Sysmon Events):**
   - Various Installation and updating procedures for Microsoft Edge and other system processes like `taskhostw.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` often run under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. These may represent regular maintenance rather than suspicious activity unless otherwise corroborated.

### Final Assessment:

Given the identified highly suspicious attempts to delete backups, attempts to access credentials, and repetitive suspicious pattern executions, there's a strong indication of malicious activity. While some benign activity is also noticed, the overarching behavior raises substantial concerns.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation and Quarantine:** Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential spread of malware and investigate the specific processes and commands executed.
- **Check Backups:** Ensure that backups are secure and intact, as there is a possible implication of attempted deletion.
- **Review Access and Permissions:** Evaluate user and system permissions concerning identified suspicious activities. Ensure least privilege principle where necessary.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Evaluate outbound and inbound traffic from the affected system for any signs of data exfiltration or command and control communication.
- **Engage Incident Response:** If not already engaged, bring in an incident response team to thoroughly assess and remediate the issue further."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure CLI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several findings indicate suspicious behavior, predominantly centered around the use of PowerShell and the command line activities:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs clearly display a command sequence where the `az login` command is followed by the deletion of an Azure Active Directory (AD) user using `az ad user delete --id $userprincipalname`. The script attempts to log into Azure and delete a specific user (`file@yourdomain.com`).
   - This operation is suspicious in nature as deleting a user account, especially using command-line interfaces like PowerShell, is a potential indicator of unauthorized activity or privilege misuse. Regular administrative tasks should ideally be performed through more controlled interfaces and not via scripts on machines unless properly authenticated and verified.

2. **Security Event Logs:**
   - The Security logs report several `4624` (Successful Logon) and `4672` (Special privileges assigned to new logon) events associated with the `SYSTEM` account. While this might be normal activity on a server, being closely timed with the PowerShell activity could indicate misuse.
   - In particular, `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and other sensitive privileges assigned are noteworthy as they relate to capabilities that could be exploited for unauthorized actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of various system binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) under the user `admin_test`, which might not be inherently malicious but becomes suspicious when clustered close in time with administrative commands executed via PowerShell.
   - Presence of several Microsoft Edge Update processes could imply background system update processes which shouldn't normally alarm unless combined with other indicators of compromise.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - There are log entries from Microsoft Edge update processes. Frequent updates could be normal but can also mask malicious activity if combined with other odd behavior, as seen in the PowerShell logs.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Though the presence of Edge Update processes and SYSTEM user actions might generally align with legitimate system operations, the unusual PowerShell activity involving the deletion of an Azure AD user without additional context or approval is clearly suspicious. It could potentially indicate misuse of credentials or an insider threat.

### Guidance on how to proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of organizational policies regarding the use of PowerShell scripts and access to Azure accounts. Ensure that the user `admin_test` is authorized and monitor their activities closely.
  - Verify whether the attempted Azure AD user deletion was a legitimate operation. Liaise with the Azure AD administrators to determine if this deletion was intentional or sanctioned.
  - Consider disabling or temporarily restricting PowerShell usage for administrative tasks until further investigation is concluded.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Perform a detailed audit of the recent activities on Azure related to the account `file@yourdomain.com` to establish a context for the deletion.
  - Review account permissions and ensure logging is enabled to detect unauthorized access efficiently.
  - If applicable, consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Azure AD operations to prevent unauthorized actions in the future.

Taking these steps will help clarify the nature of the observed behavior and mitigate potential threats effectively."
Windows - wbadmin Delete systemstatebackup,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Unusual Time Discrepancy Detected:**
   - A notable event is the system time alteration occurring at ""2024-10-26 20:13:44.5998381"" where the system time was rolled back from ""2024-10-26 20:13:50.1441639"" to ""2024-10-26 20:13:44.5987030"". This event can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate system logs or hide activities since altering time is a common tactic used by attackers to disguise their actions' timeline.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of the command `wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0` under the user ""admin_test"" raises a red flag. This command deletes all system state backups, which can be a severe security risk if executed either without cause or authorization. Such actions could be part of a cover-up of malicious activity, preventing the system state from being restored to an uncompromised state.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The security log shows that the user ""admin_test"" logged on with significant privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc. While this can be routine for admin tasks, in conjunction with other suspicious actions, it poses a potential risk of misuse.

4. **Process Executions with Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are multiple process launches through ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe"" and EdgeUpdate components, which, while common during update cycles, could be used maliciously if combined with privilege escalation or if unexpected by the system administrator.

5. **No PowerShell or System Log Entries:**
   - The absence of PowerShell script execution logs or detailed system log descriptions may indicate either a lack of activity in this area during the recorded time or potentially that log generation was disabled or output was redirected.

**Assessment:**

- The logs contain activities that are highly suggestive of potentially suspicious or even malicious intent, notably the alteration of system time and deletion of system state backups. These actions require further investigation to determine the context and intent behind them. However, without additional information such as network traffic data, user activity confirmations, or insider threat assessments, it's challenging to conclusively determine malicious intent.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in the logs are suspicious, warranting further investigation. It's crucial to verify whether these actions were legitimate administrative tasks or if they could indicate a potential system compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Verify with the system administrator or the appropriate authority to confirm if these actions were scheduled or legitimate.
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of more extended logs to understand any preceding or succeeding suspicious actions.

2. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of this system for any additional changes, focusing on logs for file modifications, user activities, and any system time adjustments.
   - Implement or verify that auditing for time changes, privilege escalations, and critical system commands are enabled and reviewed regularly.

3. **Security Measure:**
   - Evaluate the need for user education on the risks associated with command-line tools, especially those involving system backups and time settings.
   - If unauthorized behavior is confirmed, consider isolation of the affected system to prevent further damage and initiate a forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the breach."
Change User Password - Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, we need to evaluate each component for any indicative signs of malicious activities or anomalies. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Services such as `edgeupdate` are stopping, which in isolation, seem normal if they're part of scheduled updates or maintenance tasks.

2. **System Log:**
   - Events regarding time synchronization and process executions like `svchost.exe` seem usual, as the system adjusts time based on the NTP server `time.windows.com`.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Notable activity includes:
     - **Event ID 4720:** Creation of a user account `fileAdministrator`.
     - **Event ID 4724:** Password reset for the account `fileAdministrator`.
     - **Event ID 4728 and 4732:** Adding user `fileAdministrator` to a different group, which can denote privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.
   - These changes were performed by the user `admin_test`, suggesting potential internal threat or unauthorized account usage.

4. **Sysmon & Other Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of command executions with `cmd.exe` involve sensitive operations like creating users and adjusting their privileges, which is a red flag for unauthorized user management.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `net1.exe` by the user `admin_test` could indicate attempts to manage event logs or network resources.
   - The sequence of processes (`cmd.exe`, followed by `net.exe` and `net1.exe`) to manipulate user accounts underlines possibly suspicious behavior.

**Assessment:**

- The logs exhibit signs of internal account misuse, with administrative activities regarding user account creation and manipulation, which were performed by an account that appears to have administrative privileges.
- Multiple Edge update processes seem normal for a software update sequence but, given the context, need to be checked for authenticity as part of a routine check.
- The sequence and combination of events, especially around user management and privilege escalation, strongly suggest potential malicious intent rather than benign administrative actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- Immediate steps should include verifying the legitimacy and actions of the user `admin_test`.
- Conduct a full audit of account changes and group membership modifications on the system to identify any unauthorized changes.
- Review recent logins and activities associated with `admin_test` for any other unauthorized actions.
- Contain the affected system and restrict any further administrative activities until a comprehensive investigation and remediation are completed.
- Strengthen monitoring on sensitive changes, especially around account management and file system accesses, to catch suspicious behavior early."
PureLocker Ransom Note,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

After a comprehensive review of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions are drawn:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - No entries were provided in the Windows PowerShell log segment, so no insights can be derived from this section.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Events with the provider ""edgeupdate"" and messages indicating ""Service stopped"" are noted. These events in isolation appear benign and are typical of legitimate Microsoft Edge Update operations.

3. **System Log:**
   - The system logs predominantly consist of Kernel-General events relating to time change events executed by the `svchost.exe` process. These events record valid operations performed by the Windows Time Service, which synchronizes system time with a network time provider. These entries do not indicate any malicious activity.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Security logs show process executions linked to `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` as the user. These log entries with EventID 4616 relate to system time changes and are consistent with expected behaviors of a time synchronization service, which appear benign.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple system utility processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and the Edge Update executables (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were observed in Sysmon logs. 
   - A Sysmon event shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument containing ""echo data - Purelocker Ransom Note"", which indicates a potential ransomware operation. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity intended to create a ransom note file.
   - The Edge Update entries themselves seem legitimate but coupled with the `cmd.exe` event, suggest that a known valid process may have been leveraged as part of the attack vector.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the detailed analysis of the event logs, there is clear evidence of potential malicious activity, specifically:

- The `cmd.exe` event is highly suspicious and indicative of ransomware behavior, which aligns with known malicious activity patterns.

"
Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon analysis of the provided logs from different channels (Security, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon), some key observations are as follows:

#### Security Log Analysis

- **Event ID 4798** (Enumerate User Accounts): Multiple occurrences of user account enumeration process suggest a potential user enumeration script or activity. The accounts being enumerated include `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `lplui`, which is concerning as it indicates potential reconnaissance activities.
  
- **Event ID 4624** (Logon): Successful logons as `SYSTEM` using `LogonType 5`, which is a service type logon. These events look legitimate as they coincide with system tasks.
  
- **Event ID 4672** (Special Privileges Assigned): The SYSTEM account being granted special privileges is a normal event for system-related tasks.

- **Event ID 5379** (Credential Error): Multiple errors related to credential operations (`ReturnCode 3221226021`) focusing on Microsoft account operations, specifically on `02txoixylodcstop`. While errors are not uncommon, the repeated attempts could indicate unauthorized access attempts.

#### Application Log Analysis

- Logs indicate normal application behavior involving services like Windows Defender and Edge. There are no apparent red flags considering the context of normal system application updates.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- Execution command suggests an external script being run:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {if (-not (Test-Path ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.txt"")) { New-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.txt"" -Force }
  & ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\script.exe"" -accepteula ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.txt""}
  ```

  This suggests potential data exfiltration or preparation for data exfiltration attempts, as the PowerShell script is creating a file and executing an external script from a temp directory, which is often indicative of malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5** (Process Creation & Termination): The logs show execution of PowerShell with suspicious command lines, hostile activities like PowerShell being called to execute files from temp directories, which is usually an indicator of malicious operation.
  
- Frequent use of binaries like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in the context of `admin_test` user seem aligned with reconnaissance activities.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis, the logs indicate:
- **Suspicious Activity**: Multiple user enumerations and usage of PowerShell scripts along with external binary executions and credential errors point towards unusual and potentially unauthorized actions.
  
- **Potentially Malicious**: The PowerShell usage notably indicates the likely presence of a try for unauthorized script executions, possibly a precursor to data exfiltration or system compromise.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities documented in the logs exhibit several suspicious behaviors commonly associated with reconnaissance or pre-attack preparations. Although no definite evidence of compromise is observable, the activity warrants further investigation to determine the intent and scope of the operations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Containment Actions**:
   - Immediately restrict the `admin_test` account and perform a review of actions carried out by this account.
   - Monitor network traffic for any indications of data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Perform a detailed forensic examination of the identified machine to identify any unauthorized access or changes.
   
3. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Clean up suspicious scripts and secure temp directories from unauthorized writes.
   - Review user access policies and tighten restrictions on administrative tools.

4. **Proactive Measures**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar activities promptly.
   - Educate users on recognizing unauthorized actions and reporting suspicious activity."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that suggest potentially malicious behavior:

1. **VSSADMIN Usage:** 
   - The command `""vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet""` is executed, which deletes all shadow copies on the system without any prompts (`/quiet`). This is a common tactic used by ransomware to prevent recovery of files using shadow copies. The execution of this command as shown in the logs is highly suspicious as it's typically not part of routine operations for a typical user. It is concerning to see both listing (`""vssadmin.exe list shadows""`) and deleting of shadow copies, which might indicate reconnaissance followed by destructive action.

2. **Command Execution through CMD:**
   - The use of CMD to execute potentially harmful commands such as deleting shadow copies can further indicate malicious intent. The presence of `""cmd.exe"" /c vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` shows an automated approach to removing backups, which aligns with tactics seen in ransomware activity.

3. **Privilege Execution Context:**
   - The processes involved in these actions are running with high integrity levels, indicating that they have administrative privileges on the machine. This level of access suggests a misuse of privileged accounts, which is a red flag in terms of security.

4. **Widespread Utility Executions:**
   - The execution of several Windows command line utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `vssadmin.exe`, `findstr.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession may indicate a script or automated tool likely designed to obfuscate or ensure uninterrupted execution of its primary objective, which here seems to be the destruction of shadow copies.

5. **Process Anomalies:**
   - Multiple processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other command-line tools, are rapidly executed, which is unusual and can sometimes signify an automated task or script running.

Based on the analysis of these logs, it appears that there are strong indicators of malicious activity due to the combination of executing high-integrity level commands to delete system shadow copies, and the usage pattern of system utilities suggestive of a ransomware precursor behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential destructive actions.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any additional compromise, including memory analysis and inspection of additional log files.
3. Reset credentials for potentially compromised accounts, especially those with elevated privileges.
4. Restore affected data and systems from backups, ensuring the backup is clean and predates the timeframe of detected activity.
5. Review and enhance security measures, such as monitoring tools, to detect and alert on similar behaviors in the future."
Logoff System - Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key points and findings:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows executable, multiple rapid executions of `wevtutil.exe` (used for managing Windows event logs) could be indicative of logs tampering—an action often associated with malicious activity.
   - `cmd.exe` executing a shutdown command: The process `cmd.exe` with a command line `""cmd.exe"" /c shutdown /l` was found, which logs the user off. This could be a benign action but may warrant further investigation to ensure that it aligns with user activities and intentions.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event indicating a timestamp with `RulesEngine`. This seems to be a routine software protection platform activity and doesn't directly suggest any malice on its own.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge Update in the logs, with the user as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is a standard procedure for the automatic update mechanism of Microsoft Edge, and appears consistent with legitimate system maintenance activities.

4. **Hostname and Whoami Executions:**
   - Executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` seem typical for network and user identification purposes. These tools are often used in routine checks or scripts and don't, by themselves, signal malicious intent.

5. **User Privileges:**
   - Most actions recorded are executed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, which is expected for an admin user but should be monitored for unusual or unauthorized actions.

**Assessment:**

Given these observations, the recurrent execution of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest attempts at log management or clearing by an admin user account, which can sometimes mask malicious behavior. However, the presence of standard update operations and system-level processes like `sppsvc.exe` and Microsoft Edge updates, operating under legitimate system user accounts, indicates regular maintenance tasks.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity involving `wevtutil.exe` warrants closer scrutiny to confirm whether it was a part of authorized administrative duties or a potential cover for log deletion by unauthorized actors. It is advisable to cross-verify these activities with corresponding user actions and access controls to rule out any malfeasance.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the context and intent behind the executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Conduct a review of user access and administrative rights to ensure only authorized personnel can execute such commands.
- Monitor for similar patterns in log files, specifically those related to log management and process executions.

The analysis indicates a need for further investigation to fully understand the nature and intention behind these entries."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure AD PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs include numerous occurrences of Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) for the SYSTEM account using Logon Type 5, which indicates a service-based logon. This type of logon is typically considered benign as it often involves system services and is related to standard Windows operations.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that special privileges were assigned to a new logon, noting SYSTEM privileges, which is common for high-privilege accounts running system services.
   - Event ID 5379 attempted access to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive credentials, but returned a status code indicating failure (3221226021). This might warrant further investigation to rule out potential unauthorized attempts.
   - Event ID 4798 indicates enumeration of local users, performed by a SYSTEM service running `taskhostw.exe`. While not inherently malicious, repeated enumeration of accounts can sometimes precede lateral movement or privilege escalation activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of `process ID 5` and `process ID 1` indicating process creations and terminations. These involve the typical execution of system applications/services like PowerShell, conhost, EdgeUpdate, etc.
   - A particularly notable PowerShell execution (ID 1) indicates a script was run to connect to AzureAD and remove a user account (`Remove-AzureADUser`). The command used: `""powershell.exe"" & {Connect-AzureAD, $userprincipalname = \""file@yourdomain.com\"", Remove-AzureADUser -ObjectId $userprincipalname}` is suspicious and may indicate malicious intent if not authorized.
   - Many EdgeUpdate processes are seen performing updates, which are normal system maintenance activities. However, they are numerous and given their critical system privilege level in the logs, could be worth checking to ensure they align with expected software update schedules.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell execution logs corroborate what's seen in Sysmon, where `Remove-AzureADUser` was executed, potentially indicating either an unauthorized attempt to manipulate user accounts or a scheduled/scripted task. Ensure this command was intentionally run by an admin or authorized personnel.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs show standard service stop activities related to Edge Update, which aligns with Sysmon entries without any distinct anomalies.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**
Given that a sensitive command involving AzureAD was detected and no additional context or confirmation of benign intention was provided, and multiple failed credential access attempts, this situation requires further investigation. The activities suggest the possibility of misuse of administrative tools for potentially unauthorized actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Investigate the legitimacy of the PowerShell command `Remove-AzureADUser` and verify if there was a legitimate reason/logged activity from authorized personnel.
- Review the failed credential access attempts to ensure they are not indicative of attempted unauthorized access.
- Conduct a full credentials audit, especially AzureAD, to ensure no unauthorized alterations have occurred."
Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's an analysis of observed activity focusing on any suspicious or malicious patterns:

### Anomalies in Logs:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Events #3569 and #30349:** There are entries indicating a backward time change from 19:43:58 to 19:43:53 by the `svchost.exe` process. This manipulation of the system time could be a tactic employed by threat actors to evade logging mechanisms or timestamp reliance in detection tools. This is a potential indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Commands:**
   - **Event #17977:** Shows `cmd.exe` executing the command `net.exe stop spooler`. Stopping system services like the Print Spooler unexpectedly, particularly using command-line tools, can be indicative of malicious activity, often associated with privilege escalation or lateral movement mechanisms such as PrintNightmare vulnerabilities.

3. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - **Event #17991:** Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, printing event logs, which could suggest an attempt to tamper with or clear logs following activities intended to remain hidden.

4. **High Privilege Assignment:**
   - **Event #30352:** Lists privileges granted to `admin_test`, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, typically reserved for highly trusted operations, and suspicious if unused previously.

5. **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous executions within a short timeframe. Although benign in proper context, the sequence warrants attention if occurring outside regular updates or manual intervention, especially given timing with other potential indicators of compromise.

### Summary of Assessment:

- **BENIGN:** Routine Edge updates and standard service operation logs.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The time change using `svchost.exe` and operation of `wevtutil.exe` on an admin account aligns with potential tampering or evasion techniques.
- **MALICIOUS:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with `net.exe stop spooler` under a high-privilege context is notably indicative of malicious intent, particularly in combination with system time manipulation.

**Overall Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Threat Containment:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation on the `admin_test` account activities and validate recent permission changes.
  - Secure all potentially compromised accounts and investigate lateral movement activities.

- **Log Review and System Auditing:**
  - Verify Windows Event Log integrity to confirm no log tampering.
  - Analyze further for any persistence mechanisms or dropped payloads.

- **Further Investigative Actions:**
  - Perform a detailed forensic examination to capture any anomalous artifacts.
  - Evaluate the use of scheduled tasks, startup items, or non-standard account creations.

- **Strengthen Security Controls:**
  - Apply additional monitoring measures to detect further temporal manipulations.
  - Consider the implementation of stricter privilege usage policies and regular audit procedures."
