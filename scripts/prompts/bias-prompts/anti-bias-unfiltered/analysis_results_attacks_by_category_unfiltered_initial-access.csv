WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"Upon detailed review of the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate suspicious behavior typically associated with malicious activity. Here is a summary of the significant observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The event logs show multiple entries of log clearing (`EventID 104` in System and `EventID 1102` in Security), executed by the user `admin_test`. The logs for System, Security, and PowerShell channels were cleared, which can be an indicator of someone attempting to cover their tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries indicating the execution of PowerShell commands with the direct download and execution of scripts from a GitHub repository (EventID 1 in Sysmon and EventID 600 in PowerShell logs). The command involves a download from `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` GitHub repository and execution of `WinPwn.ps1`, which suggests potential unauthorized or malicious script execution.
   - The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts directly from an external source without validation or adequate security controls is highly suspicious.

3. **Anomalous Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of PowerShell and command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed under administrative privileges indicative of potentially malicious actions. Note the command line used includes cleaning logs (`cl`) which is consistent with activity to cover tracks.

4. **Integrity Level and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Processes were run with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges which could be used for unauthorized access or changes on the system.

Based on these findings of frequent log clearing alongside suspicious PowerShell activity involving the download and execution of scripts from an unauthorized source, the events collectively suggest that this host has been compromised.

**Threat Assessment:**
- **Log Clearing Attempts:** Directly indicative of attempting to hide malicious activities.
- **Unauthorized PowerShell Script Execution:** Suggestive of potential malware or system compromise.

Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"After a thorough review of the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that a PowerShell command was executed to download a file named `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` from a URL that points to a GitHub repository related to the Atomic Red Team. This activity is directly associated with T1566.001, which references phishing.
   - The command in the logs shows the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download and save the file in the temporary directory, which is a common method used in attacks to download and execute malicious files.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the event logs were cleared, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after a compromise.
   - The logs show that the log-clearing action was performed by the user `admin_test`, providing a potential indicator of insider involvement or credential compromise.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. This is corroborated by security logs and is a clear indicator of suspicious activity aimed at log tampering.
   - Other entries involve benign system processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, which are typical in Windows environments. However, the sequence of events tied to `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell` is concerning.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - Cleared application and system logs (Event ID 104) further confirm attempts at log tampering.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of downloading a potentially malicious file via PowerShell, execution of known security testing tools (Atomic Red Team), and log clearance indicates a strong possibility of malicious activity.
- The activities resemble tactics that might be used in penetration testing or by threat actors to test or execute attacks, particularly in relation to testing phishing capabilities and hiding these actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Create local account with admin privileges,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several pieces of evidence suggest unusual and potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs indicate that event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared at the same time (Event IDs 104 in System and LogFileCleared events in Security at 16:19:21).
   - Such behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following a compromise or malicious activity.

2. **Creation of a Suspicious User and Adding to Administrators Group**:
   - A new user account, `art-test`, was created and immediately added to the local administrators group (Event IDs 4720, 4728, 4732 at 16:19:22).
   - The user account was also given a specific password, which suggests manual user account creation likely by a script or a malicious actor.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The command line executed commands to add and modify the user `art-test`, as found in the Sysmon logs (Event ID 1 at 16:19:22). It included a clear text password, which is not standard behavior and often indicates script-based or malicious account creation.
   - This sequence of commands was executed by the cmd.exe and involves usage of network commands (net.exe, net1.exe) to manage user accounts.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The `admin_test` user had a token indicating elevated privileges during log events (Event ID 4672).
   - Privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` are especially noteworthy because they provide significant control over the system and can be used for malicious purposes.
   
5. **Time Synchronization and System Time Change**:
   - There was a synchronization of time with `time.windows.com` followed by a small adjustment of the system time (Event ID 4616 in Security). While this may be normal, if combined with other traces like log clearing, it may suggest manipulation of timestamps to evade detection.

6. **Use of System Tools**:
   - The usage of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs is a red flag, particularly when paired with no context suggesting a legitimate administrative cleanup (as seen in Sysmon logs).

Based on this evidence, the logs contain clear signs of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. The overriding of event logs, creation of a suspicious user with administrative rights, and execution of commands with potential privilege escalation all lead to the conclusion that these are indicators of potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The behavior exhibited in these logs is indicative of a potential security breach or malicious activity on the Windows host. Immediate investigation and remediation actions such as incident response should be initiated."
Activate Guest Account,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Clearing Event Logs:** 
   - The Security logs (`EventID 1102`) and System logs (`EventID 104`) were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. This action is typically suspicious, as attackers will often clear logs to cover their tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Arguments:**
   - A series of commands executed by `cmd.exe` and `net.exe`, specifically related to enabling the guest account: `cmd.exe` with parameters `/c net user guest /active:yes`. The Guest account is usually disabled by default for security reasons. Enabling it without proper context can be a potential security risk.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Execution of utilities with elevated privileges such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and especially `cmd.exe` indicate exploration or command execution typically associated with administrative or intrusive activity.
   
4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple `EventID 4616` and `EventID 1` indicate that the system time was changed, which could also suggest attempts to tamper with time-related logs or processes to obscure log traces.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The log entries of enabling the guest user account combined with the clearing of logs point towards malicious intent. Attackers often enable built-in accounts to maintain unauthorized access and clear logs to remove evidence of their actions.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearance, enabling the guest account, and system time changes implies that there was an attempt to cover malicious activities. This pattern is consistent with known techniques used in compromises.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The reported activity is malicious. Immediate actions should be taken to secure the affected host `SERVER002`.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected system to prevent further access or data exfiltration.

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared almost simultaneously by the user `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious as it is a common technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Unusual CMD Commands:**
   - The execution of the following command by `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious and indicates a possible privilege escalation or system compromise:
     ```plaintext
     cmd.exe /c net user guest /active:yes & net user guest Password123! & net localgroup Administrators guest /add & net localgroup ""Remote Desktop Users"" guest /add & reg add ""hklm\system\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""hklm\system\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v ""AllowTSConnections"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
     ```
   - This command activates the `Guest` account, changes the password, adds the `Guest` account to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups, and modifies registry settings to allow Terminal Server (RDP) connections. This is clear evidence of unauthorized privilege escalation and enabling remote access.

3. **Inconsistent System Behavior:**
   - The setting of the system time by a process (`svchost.exe`) could be benign due to time synchronization but, in conjunction with the above activities, raises further suspicion. It could potentially be used in anti-forensics to disrupt event timekeeping.

### Assessment:
The combination of these actions suggests a coordinated attempt to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges on the system. The clearing of event logs, activation, and modification of a Guest account with elevated permissions, and allowing RDP access are strong indicators of malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation to capture volatile data and perform disk imaging.

2. **Account and Access Review:**
   - Disable the `Guest` account and revert any unauthorized changes to user groups and policies.
   - Change passwords and review access logs for potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Log Analysis:**
   - Restore cleared logs from backups if available to analyze the full scope of activities.
   - Monitor for any additional log clearing activities across other systems.

Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several issues arise that suggest potentially malicious activity. The logs provided include entries from the Security, Windows PowerShell, System, Sysmon, and Application logs. Key observations are as follows:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 both indicate that log files have been cleared. The frequent activity of clearing these logs is highly unusual in a typical operational environment, especially being executed around the same time by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". This is a common tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Numerous PowerShell events (Event ID 600) with commands executed using a high integrity context (suggesting elevated privileges) are suspicious. The script involving `$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` and creating new `Automation Runbooks` without clear parameter inputs is concerning. These actions suggest attempts to execute scripts in a potentially unauthorized or insecure manner.
   - The command includes ""Connect-AzAccount"", which indicates an activity related to Azure, suggesting potential unauthorized access or manipulation of cloud resources.

3. **Sysmon Logs Highlight:**
   - Multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` invocations for clearing logs from Sysmon and various other Windows event logs indicate possible malicious use. This would likely aim to erase traces of activity.
   - Sysmon logs reveal several executions of system utilities (like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) initiated by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" and within a short timeframe, reinforcing the appearance of suspicious activity surrounding user context enumeration, possibly for privilege exploitation or lateral movement.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis of the logs, the signs indicate potentially malicious actions:
- The clearing of event logs.
- Execution of high-integrity PowerShell commands intended for accessing and modifying Azure resources.
- Use of system utilities likely part of reconnaissance within the network.

The resolution based on these findings is **MALICIOUS**. These actions align with typical tactics used in post-exploitation scenarios by attackers trying to maintain persistence and cover tracks.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately review and potentially disable or further scrutinize the user account `admin_test` for suspicious activities and unauthorized access.
- Conduct further incident response activities to identify and mitigate the potential impact or exploitation within your environment.
- Encourage the deployment or reinforcement of logging and monitoring policies to capture such activities in the future, possibly consider a solution to alert on event log clearing.

Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Security logs show that Event ID 1102 was triggered, indicating that the security audit log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (SID S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). This is a significant concern because clearing event logs is often a step taken by an attacker to cover malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs contain entries indicating the creation of registry entries for Google Chrome extensions (IDs: fcfhplploccackoneaefokcmbjfbkenj, fdcgdnkidjaadafnichfpabhfomcebme). This behavior is suspicious as it may indicate the installation of potentially unwanted browser extensions via PowerShell, which is a common tactic in malware distribution or adware.

3. **Use of 'wevtutil' Utility**:
   - Sysmon logs show several uses of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command targeting multiple logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. This supports the observation from point 1 about log clearing and strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent by ""admin_test"".

4. **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672)**:
   - Multiple instances where privileges were escalated to the SYSTEM account, including a comprehensive list of high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). While these can be legitimate under certain circumstances (e.g., service startup), the context of other suspicious activities makes these events worth deeper scrutiny.

5. **Process Execution & Creation**:
   - There are numerous logs where processes like `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other common executables indicative of standard Windows operations are executed. However, the execution patterns and accompanying activities, such as registry changes and log file clearing, suggest that legitimate processes might have been misused.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- **Threats/Risks Identified**:
  - The logs collectively indicate potential malicious behavior. Clearing security logs and creating questionable registry entries using PowerShell implies an attempt to hide activities and possibly maintain persistence or conduct unwanted activities.
  - The actions taken by the user ""admin_test"", particularly the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, indicate an intentional effort to obfuscate activities on Server002.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Conduct a thorough review of the user account ""admin_test"". This includes verifying the legitimacy of this account, recent changes to the account, and any history of similar actions.
  - Assess the integrity and purpose of the Chrome extensions added to the registry. Remove or disable them if they are not recognized as part of usual operations.
  - Conduct broader scans across the network to check for similar anomalous activities indicative of lateral movement or attack propagation.
  - Implement stricter auditing policies, ensuring tamper-proof logging solutions to promptly catch and respond to log-clearing events.

**Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

This conclusion is based on the presence of log-clearing events, suspicious execution of PowerShell scripts, and unauthorized registry changes, all pointing toward potentially malicious actions undertaken within the environment."
