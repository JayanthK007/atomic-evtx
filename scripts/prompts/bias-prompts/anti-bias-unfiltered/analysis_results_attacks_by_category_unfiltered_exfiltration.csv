Directory Name,AI Response
DNSExfiltration (doh),"Upon detailed analysis of the logs provided, several key indicators point toward suspicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is an execution of a PowerShell script with a path indicative of red teaming tools (`dnsexfil.ps1`). The script has an associated command (`Invoke-DNSExfiltrator`) which suggests potential data exfiltration via DNS. This is a common tactic used by attackers to exfiltrate data stealthily.

2. **Cleared Event Logs**: The logs indicate that the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user account `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity as it is often done to cover tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**: Many processes, especially the PowerShell instance, are executed at a high integrity level, which implies administrative privileges were used. This is common in attacks where privilege escalation has occurred.

4. **Wevtutil Usage**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is especially suspicious when combined with the PowerShell activity. `Wevtutil` is a command-line utility used to clear event logs, and when misused, it indicates an attempt to delete records that might expose malicious activity.

5. **Host Enumeration Commands**: The use of tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may appear benign on their own but are often utilized in the reconnaissance phase of an attack to learn more about the system and user context.

Considering these points:

- **PowerShell usage for potentially malicious script execution**, combined with the attempts to **clear event logs** strongly suggests an effort to conduct and then cover up unauthorized actions.

Based on this analysis, the activity observed in the logs is classified as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the compromise, including further examination of the processes and network activities during the time of the compromise.
3. **Remediation**: Restore the system from a known good backup, change the compromised credentials, and assess other systems in the network for similar indicators.
4. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring to detect similar patterns and deploy protective measures such as blocking malicious scripts, monitoring DNS queries for data exfiltration activities, and alerting on critical event log clearance attempts.
5. **Security Awareness**: Train users and administrators about the importance of legitimate administrative activities and secure handling of credentials to prevent unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

This resolution is based on the observed indicators and behaviors present in the logs, which are typical patterns of malicious activity."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of events that are indicative of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Multiple entries in the Security and System logs indicate that the event logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Specifically, Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log point to this event.
   - Log clearing is often associated with malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks after compromise activities.

2. **Privilege Activities:**
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log shows that the `admin_test` account utilized a set of high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others. These privileges can be abused for malicious purposes, such as loading malicious drivers or taking control of processes.

3. **Unusual Windows PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs report usage of the `Invoke-WebRequest` command to send the content of the Notepad executable to a local server (`http://127.0.0.1`). This is abnormal as sending binary file content to a web server is generally not part of normal operations and could represent data exfiltration or malicious data manipulation.

4. **Program Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear application logs, which is consistent with attempts to hide activities. This utility can be used to manage event logs programmatically.
   - There are several instances of `whoami.exe` execution. While not inherently malicious, in combination with the context (clearing logs, privilege escalation), it could be part of reconnaissance activities.
   - The use of the `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` multiple times also raises questions, as they are often used by attackers to gather system information during intrusion phases.

Based on the analysis, there is clear evidence of activities that suggest an attempt to cover malicious actions. The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, and suspicious PowerShell command usage highlights a high likelihood of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a full investigation on the `admin_test` account. Check for any unauthorized accesses or changes it may have caused.
- **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic associated with `Server002` for unusual outbound connections that could indicate exfiltration attempts.
- **System Integrity Checks:** Verify the integrity of known critical files and executables on `Server002` to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
- **User Account Audit:** Review all actions associated with the `admin_test` account and consider revoking or monitoring usage until clarified.
- **Incident Response:** Mobilize the security incident response team to contain and remediate any further threats and to ensure this activity is thoroughly documented and analyzed.

It's essential to act rapidly to assess and mitigate potential development of these activities into further compromise."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - ICMP,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events show signs of potentially suspicious and malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs indicate repeated clearing of the event logs (Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Security, and System). This is evident from both the System logs (EventID 104) and Security logs (EventID 1102), showing log file clearing actions were performed by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often a method employed by malicious actors to hide their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Script**: The Sysmon logs highlight a PowerShell command execution. The PowerShell command in question reads data from `notepad.exe` and sends it in chunks using ICMP (ping) to `127.0.0.1`. This kind of activity is very abnormal for legitimate operations and might imply trying to exfiltrate data within controlled environments using covert channels, even though directed to a loopback address.

3. **Time Stomping**: The Security logs (EventID 4616) indicate manipulation of the system time. This activity potentially signifies efforts to confuse logs' chronological integrity, consistent with malicious activity.

4. **Processes and Contexts**: The spawned processes such as `wevtutil.exe` used for event log manipulation are consistently executed by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` under high integrity levels, which could suggest a misuse of privileges.

### Assessment

The combination of these activities strongly suggests malicious behavior:

- **Log clearing** by `admin_test` without any clear legitimate reason is suspicious, especially since multiple types of logs are cleared within a short time frame.
- **Manipulation of system time** aligns with tactics used to evade detection.
- **Suspicious PowerShell activity** demonstrates an anomaly that merits further investigation, particularly its potential misuse in data handling and obfuscation.
  
### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The actions, patterns, and behavior indicate a high likelihood of compromise. Here are the recommended steps:

1. **Investigate `admin_test` Account**: Review this account's permissions, recent activity logs, interactive sessions, and any anomalies associated throughout the network.
  
2. **Conduct a Full System and Network Audit**: Verify the integrity of other hosts on the same network for similar activities, given that compromise on one host might spread.
  
3. **Enhance Monitoring**: Deploy real-time behavioral monitoring and logging to capture suspicious activities immediately.

4. **Review and Restore System Time**: If manipulated, check the system time settings and ensure they are synchronized and maintained with a trusted time source.

5. **Proactively Block or Limit** ICMP traffic if utilized internally to facilitate data movement as noted in the suspicious PowerShell activity.

Immediate containment and comprehensive incident response should follow to mitigate any potential impact and secure the system's integrity."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several insights and observations can be drawn:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a script being executed that creates a file with line numbers and then posts this data to ""example.com"" using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This behavior of posting potentially sensitive data to an external site can be suspicious, particularly if it's unauthorized or not part of regular operations.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - In the System, Security, and Sysmon logs, there are records of log files being cleared by the user `admin_test`. The use of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility to clear event logs (`cl` option) is a known method used by malicious actors to cover tracks after executing malicious activities. This behavior is documented in multiple logs (Sysmon Event IDs 17938 to 17971).

3. **Alteration of System Time:**
   - The logs show events where the system time was altered. Changes to the system time can disrupt forensic analysis and are frequently associated with malicious activity to confuse log timelines.

4. **Administrator Privileges:**
   - The security logs show the user `admin_test` with an extensive list of high-level privileges. Such privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) when combined with suspicious activities like the log clearance, increase the overall risk.

5. **Sysmon and Conhost Activity:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed around the same time (within milliseconds of each other) suggests automation or batch script execution, typically indicative of scripted log clearance operations.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The reviewed logs exhibit several red flags that may indicate a compromise or unauthorized activities:
- The execution of a PowerShell script that sends data externally is potentially malicious.
- The deliberate clearing of event logs by `admin_test` denotes effort to obfuscate activities which generally aligns with malicious intent.
- Alterations in system time can serve as a strategy to interfere with time-stamping of events, which is considered suspicious.
  
### Conclusion:

Based on the provided logs and analysis, the activities observed are **MALICIOUS**. The combination of automated log clearance, unauthorized data posting via PowerShell, and system time alterations justify a high level of concern.

### Recommendation:

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate the user `admin_test` for any unauthorized activities or security policy violations.
  - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent data exfiltration or further malicious actions.
  - Review network traffic logs to identify if any unauthorized data exfiltration occurred to external IPs around the time of these logs.
  
- **Long-Term Actions:**
  - Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell usage and logging.
  - Enforce policies that prevent unauthorized clearing of event logs.
  - Regularly audit administrative accounts and their activities for unusual patterns or misuse.
  - Review system time settings and ensure corrective controls to block unauthorized changes.

These actions are essential in mitigating the potential impacts and improving future security postures."
Exfiltrate data HTTPS using curl windows,"After analyzing the provided log entries, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious activity primarily focused on the clearing of event logs, which could suggest an attempt to cover tracks typical of malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security log contains an entry (Event ID: 1102) indicating the security log was cleared by the `admin_test` user. This is a significant event, as clearing logs can be an indicator of someone attempting to cover their tracks after malicious activity.
   - The system log also shows multiple Event ID: 104 entries for log file cleared events by the same user (`admin_test`). Channels cleared include ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"". Multiple log clearances at the same timestamp further support the suspicion of concealing actions.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - **Process Execution:** There are several Sysmon events indicating various command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear logs. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines like ""cl Security"", ""cl System"", suggest explicit actions taken to clear logs.
   - **Unusual Command Execution:** The execution of PowerShell and command prompt, as well as file transfer operations using `curl.exe`, are seen. For example, a command with CURL attempts to upload a file to an external site (`https://file.io/`). This is highly indicative of data exfiltration activities.

3. **Data Exfiltration:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process is involved in running a command to upload a file using `curl.exe` to `file.io`, which could indicate data exfiltration.
   - The file path involved in the `curl` command suggests the file might be related to a known attack simulation framework (`AtomicRedTeam`). However, use in a production environment without proper consent or oversight might still be indicative of a real threat.

### Assessment:

- The combination of event log clearing actions performed by the `admin_test` user and potentially malicious data exfiltration attempts using `curl.exe` to communicate with an external service strongly suggests malicious intent.
- While the presence of software used for attack simulation (like the one noted in the CURL command) might point to a benign purpose if used thoughtfully for testing, without context suggesting legitimate use, the observed actions remain concerning.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the activity logs, the assessment of the situation indicates the presence of potentially **MALICIOUS** behavior, characterized by actions to conceal activities (log clearances) and possible data exfiltration.

### Recommendations:

- **Incident Response:** Engage the incident response team to further investigate and contain potential threats. The focus should be placed on understanding the actions of the `admin_test` user and reviewing network traffic for unauthorized data transfers.
- **Audit and Access Review:** Review and audit administrative access and privileges, specifically focusing on the `admin_test` account usage and related systems.
- **Security Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring on critical systems to detect similar activities earlier, looking for patterns like unauthorized log clearing or external data transfers.
- **User Awareness and Training:** Provide training on identifying and reporting unusual system activity to relevant personnel to prevent and quickly respond to potential security incidents.

This resolution should be supported by additional analysis to confirm the legitimacy of the `AtomicRedTeam` tool presence and its recent activity in the environment."

3. **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):**
   - The `admin_test` account logged in using NTLM authentication, and the activity is tied to an IP address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`), which may indicate a remote login session.

### Sysmon Event Logs:
1. **`wevtutil.exe` Execution:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times with the `cl` (clear) command to clear various logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, etc.). This is consistent with attempts to hide activity from analysis.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that included an `Invoke-WebRequest` command to attempt exfiltration of data to `https://google.com`. The command also mentions ""This is ART IcedID Botnet Exfil Test,"" indicating potential use of malicious tooling (IcedID Botnet is known to perform credential theft, data exfiltration, and further network compromise).

### System and Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Similar to the Sysmon logs, clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs was observed. This repeated clearing across different logs further supports the hypothesis of malicious intent to erase traces of unauthorized activities.

2. **PowerShell Script Details:**
   - The PowerShell logs provide additional context confirming the command's intention was consistent with unauthorized data manipulation and potential exfiltration efforts.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- These logs show strong evidence of malicious activity, including credential usage, log manipulation to hide actions, and execution of potentially harmful scripts.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further malicious activity and potential spread of any malware.

Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources including Security, System, Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels, a pattern of suspicious activities emerges particularly regarding the use of PowerShell. Here's a detailed analysis focusing on indicators of potential compromise:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Several events indicate that logs channels were cleared around the same time. This includes Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Event clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Time Change Detection**:
   - There are events indicating changes in system time, which could be an attempt to evade time-based security checks or forensic investigations. The same user, ""LOCAL SERVICE,"" changed system times which might not be a typical behavior.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed which attempted to exfiltrate data using FTP (`Invoke-WebRequest`) to an external server (`ftp://example.com`). The use of PowerShell for such data exfiltration tasks is a well-known TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures) associated with cyber threats.
   - The script was executed by the user ""admin_test"" with high integrity level, which suggests it might be leveraged by someone with administrative privileges.

4. **Processes With High Integrity Level**:
   - The sequence of events suggests several high-integrity commands were executed by the ""admin_test"" user, including the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs and the suspicious PowerShell commands indicating potential misuse of privileges.

5. **Credential Access Events**:
   - Event ID 5379 from the security logs shows failed credential access attempts towards a Microsoft account service, returning error codes (`ReturnCode` which does not translate to success) which could suggest brute-force attempts or credential access attempts.

Given these considerations:
- There are clear indications of potentially malicious activities focusing on administrative level manipulations, log-clearing operations, and attempted data exfiltration using PowerShell to an external FTP server.
- The execution of these events under the administrator-level account ""admin_test"" heightens risks, as these actions typically require elevated privileges.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: 
- A thorough investigation is necessary to confirm unauthorized access and potential data breach attempts.
- Immediate actions should include:
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
  - Reset passwords for the ""admin_test"" account and other sensitive accounts.

Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP - Rclone,"After a thorough examination of the provided logs, we can identify several activities and patterns that indicate potentially malicious or unauthorized actions on the host server, Server002:

### Key Findings:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed which involves using `rclone` to configure an FTP server and exfiltrate a file named `exfil.zip` from `C:\Users\Public\Downloads\`. This indicates an attempt to upload files to a remote server (`ftp.dlptest.com`) using credentials (`dlpuser` user) and suggests possible data exfiltration activities.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of the event log channels (System, Security, and PowerShell) being cleared. This behavior is common in attempts to cover up tracks after performing potentially illicit actions on the system.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil` and `conhost`:**
   - The logs show repeated usage of `wevtutil` to manipulate or clear logs, which is often used by attackers to obfuscate any tell-tale system or security alerts.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` instances launching shortly after `wevtutil.exe` could suggest scripted automation related to the event log operations.

4. **High Integrity Operations:**
   - Commands and script executions are being performed under `High` integrity level, which indicates elevated permissions. The `admin_test` account is performing these high-privileged actions, which is a typical need for making significant system changes such as clearing logs.

### Assessing the Situation:
- These logs clearly suggest an attempt to hide activities and potential data exfiltration which can be linked to unauthorized access and malicious intent.
- The presence of both `PowerShell` scripts for data exfiltration and log clearing activities signifies a coherent effort at compromise and cover-up.

Exfiltrate data with HTTP POST to text storage sites - pastebin.com (Windows),"An analysis of the provided logs reveals the following indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: There is an event capturing the execution of a PowerShell script with suspicious behavior. The script attempts to send potentially sensitive data (referred to as ""secrets, API keys, passwords"") to Pastebin using an HTTP POST request. This action is indicative of data exfiltration, which is a common behavior associated with malicious activity or data breaches.

   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** (Process Creation) captures `powershell.exe` executing a command that includes sending data to ""https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php"". The command line used includes storing an API key and content that could be sensitive, implying data exfiltration.
   
   - **Associated Activity Logs**: The Windows PowerShell log entries corroborate this activity by showing the PowerShell engine starting with the same script as seen in the Sysmon logs.

2. **Event Log Manipulation**: 
   - Multiple event logs (Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) have been cleared:
     - **System Log**: `EventID 104` indicates that the system log and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - **Security Log**: `EventID 1102` indicates that the security log was cleared.

   Clearing event logs can be a tactic used by attackers to conceal their tracks after performing malicious activities. 

3. **Unusual Process Execution**: 
   - The logs indicate various system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) running often and clearing logs, aligned with attempts to evade detection.

4. **Network Activity and Privilege Elevation**: 
   - The PowerShell script execution with network activity raises concerns of privilege abuse (since it operates at a high integrity level) potentially aimed at performing exfiltration without triggering common defenses against low-privileged users.

### Assessment:
The occurrence of suspicious PowerShell execution, coupled with the clearing of multiple event logs, implies potential compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Next Steps:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.

Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SMTP,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious activities were identified:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Command**: 
   - There is an event related to PowerShell with the command line indicating the use of `Send-MailMessage` to send an email with ""notepad.exe"" attached, which correlates with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1048.003 (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted/Obfuscated Non-C2 Protocol). This is a highly unusual operation, especially since notepad.exe is a legitimate executable commonly used for benign purposes and should not be attached as it does not naturally serve a function when sent via email.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The system log shows that event logs (System, Security, and PowerShell logs) have been cleared shortly after the suspicious PowerShell activity. Log clearing is often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks post-compromise.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil`**:
   - The presence of multiple executions of `wevtutil` command-line utility to clear event logs is observed, which is a known technique (T1070.001 - Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs). Although `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool, frequent and coordinated executions in this context are suspicious.

4. **Privilege Execution**:
   - Several processes (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) were executed with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were used. Though these tools are legitimate, the context of their execution denotes elevated privileges usage in conjunction with suspicious activity.

Based on the above analysis, the resolution for this activity should be classified as:

- **MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Possible data exfiltration using PowerShell and the `Send-MailMessage` command.
- Removal of forensic evidence by clearing multiple event logs, potentially indicating a successful compromise and data exfiltration attack.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately initiate an incident response procedure to isolate the affected system (""Server002"") to prevent further damage or data loss.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the intrusion and identify any additional compromised systems.
3. Review access logs and configurations to identify how the attacker gained initial access and move laterally.
4. Enhance monitoring and alerting for systems with similar configurations and educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.
5. Consider network segmentation and additional security measures such as stricter email attachment policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.

This comprehensive response ensures that steps are taken to mitigate the current threat and prevent future incidents."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several anomalies and indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Use of PowerShell for Data Exfiltration**:
   - In both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, a PowerShell command is executed with the intent to exfiltrate data. The command `Resolve-DnsName` is used to send data encoded in Base64 as DNS queries to a specified external DNS server (`dns.example.com`). This is a common technique used for data exfiltration where the DNS protocol is used as a covert channel.
   - The command executed was: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$dnsServer = ""dns.example.com""; $exfiltratedData = ""SecretDataToExfiltrate""; ...
     ```

2. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear logs) commands were observed for clearing the Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs. Clearing logs is a suspicious activity as it indicates an attempt to cover tracks, typically associated with malicious actions.
   - The logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` who has administrative privileges, thereby increasing the risk and suspicion level.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The Security logs show entries with an `EventID` of `4616`, which indicates a change in the system time. The time change can be a tactic to manipulate logs and timestamps, which can complicate forensic investigations.

4. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed under high integrity levels by `admin_test`. While these can be legitimate processes, the context (in conjunction with log clearing) raises suspicion.

5. **Unexpected PowerShell Engine State Changes**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a change in the engine state from ""Available"" to ""Stopped."" This can be seen in conjunction with log manipulation and exfiltration tasks, typically indicating suspicious activity around script execution.

### Assessment:

Based on the observed activities, especially the PowerShell-based data exfiltration attempts and log-clearing behaviors, these actions align with typical indicators of compromise. The activities are not consistent with benign administrative actions due to the direct involvement of covert data transfer methods and attempts to conceal activity.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and lateral movement.
   
2. **Conduct Comprehensive Forensic Investigation**: Gather additional forensic data (e.g., memory capture, disk image) to analyze any additional persistent threats and understand the entry point.

3. **Review User Account Activity**: Review `admin_test` user account activities and other privileged accounts for any unauthorized accesses or anomalies.

4. **Patch and Harden Systems**: Ensure all systems are patched and security features such as logging, PowerShell transcription, and auditing are robustly configured.

5. **Implement Network Monitoring for DNS Traffic**: Configure network security controls to monitor and analyze DNS traffic for potential exfiltration attempts.

6. **User Awareness Training**: Conduct security awareness training sessions for employees, focusing on the recognition and reporting of malicious activities."
MAZE FTP Upload,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several indicators suggest the possibility of suspicious and potentially malicious activity occurring on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log Clearance Events:** 
   - **Event ID 104** in the System logs and **Event ID 1102** in the Security logs indicate that logs have been cleared. These actions were executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Log clearance, especially across System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after unauthorized or suspicious actions.

2. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - Events **4616** in the Security logs and **ID 1** in the System logs, both report a change in system time. This may indicate an attempt to manipulate log time stamps, which could be a component of an attacker’s strategy to obscure malignant activities by altering log details or their sequence.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - Execution of a PowerShell script attempting to upload files from a directory (specifically Windows\Temp directory) to a local FTP server (ftp://127.0.0.1/) is particularly concerning. The use of **Windows PowerShell** to execute scripts that interact with network resources is a well-known technique used by attackers to exfiltrate data or maintain persistent access.
   - The PowerShell command is executed under the context of ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", again indicating administrative privileges which increase the threat level when coupled with potentially harmful automation scripts.

4. **Use of wevtutil.exe:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) are logged, specifically to clear logs (System, Application, Security logs) utilizing the command-line arguments. This is a typical action used by attackers post-compromise to erase forensic evidence.

5. **Usage of Utilities like HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE:**
   - These utilities are normal, however, in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activities, they could indicate reconnaissance or validation of the compromising user's environment and identity context which could factor into unauthorized access validation or system surveying.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the analysis above, these logs exhibit activity patterns consistent with malicious behavior:
  - Tampering with system time.
  - Clearing security logs.
  - Use of administrative command line utilities for log clearance.
  - Execution of a PowerShell script for potential data exfiltration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on the host.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Preserve the current state of the system for forensic analysis by acquiring a disk image copy.
   - Review account activities for ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" and investigate any anomalies or access from external sources.

3. **Remediation and Recovery:**
   - Reset credentials associated with the account potentially involved and evaluate all similar privileged accounts.
   - Ensure that system time is synchronized correctly with an authenticated NTP server and logs are monitored for any further discrepancies.

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement advanced Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to flag such behavior in real-time in the future.
   - Set up log integrity monitoring and alerts for log clearance activities.

5. **Reporting and Communication:**
   - Prepare a detailed incident report for internal stakeholders and, if necessary, external regulatory obligations. Enforce updated security awareness training focusing on operational security and incident response protocols."
Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs indicates the presence of potentially malicious activity. Below are the key findings from the logs:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
    - Several instances of event log clearing (`wevtutil.exe cl` command) are present, clearing the ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" channels. This activity is often associated with attempts to cover tracks post-exploitation or during lateral movement activities.
    - The log clearing was performed by a user named ""admin_test"", suggesting potential misuse of an administrative account.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell script captured in the logs is suspicious as it reads a file in chunks, encodes it in Base64, and sends it to an external server (http://example.com) via `Invoke-WebRequest`. This pattern is common in data exfiltration or when uploading data to a command and control (C2) server.
    - The context of the PowerShell execution implies that sensitive data could be sent out, which is a common tactic in cyber attacks involving data theft.

3. **Sysmon Observations**:
    - The launch of PowerShell and subsequent spawning of `conhost.exe` are in line with the suspicious activity above, further indicating that scripts were executed with administrative privilege, which could point towards abuse of legitimate system administration tools for malicious purposes.
    - The processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed suggest reconnaissance attempts to gather system or user information.

4. **Security Log Indicators**:
    - Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by the ""admin_test"" user. Clearing security logs can be part of an adversary's effort to eliminate forensic evidence of their activities on the host.

5. **Other System Activities**:
    - The presence of normal update and Windows Defender activities does not negate the suspicious activities but highlights that normal operations continued alongside potential malicious actions.

**Assessment**:
The logs indicate potentially malicious activities, including the use of powerful system utilities to clear evidence and run scripts that align with common adversarial tactics for persistence, privilege escalation, or reconnaissance. The activities warrant a thorough investigation and immediate action to prevent further compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the affected system (""Server002"") immediately to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, including a review of account usage and network traffic associated with the PowerShell script.
- Review and enhance security policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing and PowerShell script execution.
- Reset or review credentials related to ""admin_test"" and ensure proper multi-factor authentication and least privilege principles are applied."
