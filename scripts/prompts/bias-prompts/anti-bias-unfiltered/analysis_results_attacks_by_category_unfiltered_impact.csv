Directory Name,AI Response
Modify VSS Service Permissions,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities and patterns emerge that warrant further scrutiny.

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command being used to clear event logs (`Security Log ID: 1102`, `Sysmon Process: 3164`, `System Log ID: 104`). This behavior is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges**:
   - A significant escalation of privileges is recorded in `Security Log ID: 4672`, showing the user `admin_test` acquiring sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges could allow for unauthorized activities on the system.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Events indicating the system time being altered (`Security Log ID: 4616`, `System Events ID: 1`). Attackers often manipulate time to align with their operations, especially to evade detection via time-based log correlation.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Command executed via `cmd.exe` with specific `sc sdset` command (`Sysmon Event ID: 1`). This could be an attempt at altering service permissions, potential precursor to a privilege escalation or lateral movement.

5. **Unusual Process Activities**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` started in quick succession, managed by the `admin_test` account, and the repetitive usage of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, even from temporary directories (`Sysmon Event ID: 18012`). Although the latter could be benign, repeated execution from temporary paths might indicate abuse of legitimate software for malicious purpose.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the activity observed in the logs, the behavior is not consistent with standard user or administrative operations and matches several known indicators of compromise (IoCs). The privilege escalation, log clearing, and time manipulation suggest a potential attempt to compromise and cover tracks on the system.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Initiate an IR (Incident Response) procedure, isolate the affected system to prevent further spread.
- Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized actions or previously undetected threats.
- Enhance monitoring on systems and employ EDR solutions for better traceability.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of access logs and configurations throughout the network.
- If not already in place, consider implementing security measures like MFA, strict log management policies, and regular audits of sensitive account privileges."
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"Upon examining the given Windows event logs, here are the key findings and the final resolution based on the observed activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Various instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command line options to clear logs (e.g., `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`). This is a standard tool used to manage Windows Event Logs, but its use to clear event logs can be indicative of malicious intent to cover tracks.

2. **Cleared Event Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that event logs for `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels were cleared (`EventID 104` for System, `EventID 1102` for Security). This is suspicious as clearing logs is a common technique used by attackers to erase traces of their activity.

3. **Registry Key Changes:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed commands to disable system restore (`reg add` for `DisableConfig` and `DisableSR`). Disabling system restore points can be a tactic used to impede recovery efforts after an infection or unauthorized change.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The series of events including usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs and `cmd.exe` for modifying registry values to disable system restore points, together reflect techniques often associated with post-exploitation activity to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

### Final Assessment:
The combination of these behaviors, particularly the clearing of multiple log channels, disabling system restore, and the context in which these operations occur, strongly indicate malicious activity intended to conceal aspects of an intrusion or unauthorized activity on the host.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS -** The logs contain clear signs of malicious activity due to the concealment behaviors exhibited through log clearing and system restore disabling. Immediate incident response measures should be initiated.

### Recommendation:
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Inspect the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unauthorized usage or compromise.
- Review network activity and configuration changes proximate to the logged events.
- Ensure that log retention policies are implemented to prevent unauthorized log clearing in the future.
- Consider reimaging the host if further evidence of compromise is found during investigation to effectively remove any latent threats."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, I have identified a series of events that raise significant concerns and suggest potential malicious activity or compromise. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared:** Events in the `System` log with Event ID `104` and `Security` log with Event ID `1102` indicate that logs were cleared. Specifically, the user `admin_test` appears to have executed the command to clear event logs using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and make forensic investigation difficult.
   - **Correlation with Sysmon Logs:** Sysmon events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands, initiated by `admin_test`, to clear logs in multiple channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`).

2. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - **VSSAdmin and WMIC Usage:** The execution of `vssadmin.exe list shadows` and `wmic shadowcopy delete` by `admin_test` is suspicious, especially since these commands are often used by attackers to manipulate or delete Windows Volume Shadow Copies as part of ransomware or other attack strategies to prevent system rollback.
   - **Command Line Execution with High Integrity Level:** The execution context shows high integrity levels, suggesting privileged access was used for these actions.

3. **Windows Command Line Activity:**
   - **Unexpected `cmd.exe` Usage:** The use of `cmd.exe` to execute commands like `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete` further supports suspicious activities, especially in conjunction with log clearing and high integrity level execution.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - **Frequent and Rapid Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:** There is an unusually high volume of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions within a very short timeframe. While software updates could trigger multiple related processes, the frequency appears excessive and warrants investigation to rule out abuse of legitimate processes for malicious purposes.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

The identified activities, especially the clearing of event logs, the use of system utilities (`vssadmin.exe` and `wmic.exe`) for potentially malicious purposes, and the pattern of execution suggest that there is a **high likelihood of malicious activity** on the host `Server002`, performed by the user `admin_test`.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional indicators of compromise or persistent threats.
- Review account activity for `admin_test` and consider resetting credentials or taking appropriate security measures.
- Conduct a comprehensive threat hunt across the network to ensure no other systems are similarly compromised."
Windows - Disable the SR scheduled task,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - Multiple log clearing operations are evident, notably occurring for the System and Windows PowerShell event logs. This is executed by the user ""admin_test"" via the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility by using a high integrity level, which is often associated with administrative permissions.

2. **Command Using `schtasks`**:
   - There is a notable usage of `schtasks.exe` to disable the System Restore task:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c schtasks.exe /Change /TN \""\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SystemRestore\\SR\"" /disable""
     ```
   - Such actions could be an indicator of malicious intent, as disabling system restore can be a tactic used by malicious actors to prevent administrators from reverting changes made by malware.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are events logged for changes to the system time (EventID 4616 in the Security log). While legitimate, frequent or unauthorized time changes can sometimes be used to evade detection systems or manipulate timestamps related to malicious activities.

4. **Common Windows Operations**:
   - Apart from the above activities, there are processes related to Microsoft Edge Update and Windows services starting or stopping, which appear regular and are not immediately indicative of malicious behavior without additional context.

5. **User Executed Processes**:
   - The `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and routine update operations look benign and are typical, as they relate to system or software updates by Microsoft and are executed by 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM' or 'SERVER002\admin_test'. Thus they do not raise suspicions unless correlated with other malicious activities.

### Conclusion:

The logs show evidence of potentially **suspicious** behavior, primarily due to:
- Log file clearing events executed by user ""admin_test"".
- Usage of `schtasks.exe` to disable a system protection feature.

These activities could belong to a legitimate administrative task, but they are often indicative of malicious activities aiming to obscure actions or disable security features. The logs should be marked as **SUSPICIOUS** and warrant further investigation, including:
- Confirming the intent and need behind the Sysmon and event log file clearings.
- Verifying the legitimacy of the user ""admin_test"" and correlation with expected changes.
- Reviewing any further actions around the time of these logs to corroborate if this aligns with any benign administrative tasks or scripts."
ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host, predominantly focused on log maintenance and command execution. Here are the key observations and findings:

1. **Security Log Cleared**:
   - Event ID 1102: Logs indicate that the Security log was cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at `2024-10-27 12:04:10.6098700`.
   - This action is highly suspicious as clearing security logs is often an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activities. This specific action warrants further investigation to determine the context and intent.

2. **System Log Cleared**:
   - Two instances of Event ID 104: Both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by `SERVER002\admin_test` shortly after the clearing of the Security log.
   - Clearing multiple logs in rapid succession is another red flag, suggesting the cover-up of unauthorized actions or privilege escalations.

3. **Use of PowerShell and Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple executions of commands involving `wevtutil`, which is a command-line utility for interacting with event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl [logname]`), were observed. This tool was run with high integrity by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Repeated interactions with event logs using wevtutil can indicate malicious intent, especially considering the logs were subsequently cleared.
   
4. **Anomalous CMD and External Tool Execution**:
   - The log details revealed an interesting command: `cmd.exe` initiating a sequence to run `plink.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `plink.exe` is a command-line connection tool often used in networked environments for SSH, Telnet, and Rlogin, but it can also be misused for lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - The command includes a hardcoded password and suggests sending a specific script located in a directory associated with an attack simulation framework (`AtomicRedTeam`).
   - This is not typical legitimate activity and suggests a simulated attack scenario or testing that wasn't warranted.

5. **Update and Service Logs**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update services are present. While the services stopping and starting could be benign, the context in this analysis emphasizes the other suspicious activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed review of the logs, the user's actions, which include clearing crucial event logs and executing potentially harmful command sequences, indicate a level of malicious behavior:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the server (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the server, focusing on unusual file changes and network connections.

2. **User Activity Investigation**:
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or activities.
   - Audit additional logs or tools, if available, for lateral movements or data access patterns.

3. **Review and Mitigation**:
   - Review access controls and log security configurations to prevent unauthorized log clearings.
   - Consider implementing more stringent monitoring measures, such as SIEM solutions with alerting on security log clearings and suspicious PowerShell activities.

4. **Engage Threat Intelligence**:
   - If available, engage threat intelligence resources to understand if this behavior aligns with known attack patterns or groups.

Further action will be depend on the detailed forensic insights and any new threat intelligence data acquired in subsequent investigations."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, let's analyze the key details that stand out:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared:**
     - Event ID: 104 for System and PowerShell logs.
     - Event ID: 1102 for Security log.
   - These activities were initiated by the user `admin_test`, and the log clearing was executed using `wevtutil.exe`, a native Windows command-line tool used to manage event logs, which may be legitimate but is often used maliciously to cover tracks.
   - The user `admin_test` is part of the domain `SERVER002`, suggesting potentially elevated privileges.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Event ID: 4616 from the Security log indicates a system time change. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service-hosting application. Although not inherently suspicious, combined with the cleared logs, it suggests possible tampering to modify timelines.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script executed, attempting to change the desktop wallpaper using code downloaded from a URL (`https://redcanary.com/...`).
   - The use of PowerShell to alter system settings and invoke .NET libraries (`SystemParametersInfo`) could be part of a legitimate administrative task but often indicates potential misuse aligned with adversarial techniques for persistence or data obscuring.

4. **Process Execution Analysis (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen executing close to log-clearing events, further implying they were used to clear logs.
   - Use of `powershell.exe` suggests potential script execution without an explicitly benign purpose. 

5. **Legitimate Software Updates:**
   - Multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, indicating regular Microsoft Edge updates. There appear to be no indicators suggesting this activity is malicious or unusual.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Event Patterns:**
  - The combination of log clearing and PowerShell activity indicates potential signs of compromise or malicious intent. The log clearing and alteration of execution history (via `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell scripts) align with tactics used by attackers to maintain and hide their presence.

- **Potential Risks:**
  - Unauthorized access or usage by `admin_test` might be involved in malicious activities such as modifying system settings or hiding other nefarious operations.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Given the above findings, there is substantial ground to treat the activity as more than benign. The actions suggest suspicious behavior that, while currently not definitively malicious, has concerning attributes that necessitate a deeper investigation.

#### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Action:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account access patterns to verify legitimacy.
- Inquire into the intention behind the PowerShell script, particularly if this script execution was authorized for a legitimate purpose.
- Enable additional logging and possibly deploy enhanced monitoring (e.g., via Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)) to track any further unconventional changes to system logs or settings.
- Review network access data to identify any unusual outbound traffic associated with the known suspicious activities (e.g., PowerShell execution, application control policies)."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events and behaviors indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Logs**: Events in the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs show multiple instances of log files being cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". This is highly suspicious, as malicious actors often clear logs to cover their tracks. The Event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log correspond to log file clearing actions, with the process `wevtutil.exe` (a command-line utility used for event log management) being executed by the user.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs record the execution of a PowerShell script by the same user account ""admin_test"" with a potentially sensitive script. The script attempts to remove a user from the ""Domain Admins"" group, which is a critical modification of administrative privileges within the domain. The command-line argument contained within the PowerShell event suggests the script was using hardcoded credentials to perform this operation, which bypasses standard security practices.

3. **Execution of Event Utilities**: The presence of `wevtutil.exe` commands aimed at clearing specific logs (System, Application, Windows PowerShell) under the context of a privileged user indicates an attempt to cover up potentially malicious actions.

4. **Abnormal Processes**: The process execution patterns, specifically the sequence of using system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in conjunction with the PowerShell script, suggest an attacker’s behavior in profiling the system and removing traces.

5. **High Integrity Level**: Many of the processes executed, including `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`, are running at a high integrity level, suggesting privileged execution, consistent with an attempt to mask malicious activities.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the behaviors and patterns observed strongly suggest malicious activity. The clearing of event logs, execution of sensitive PowerShell scripts aiming at modifying domain-level permissions, and the combination of system utilities usage align with actions taken during a compromise or attack to both conduct malicious tasks and erase traces.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
Given the signs of log tampering, privilege escalation attempts, and abnormal use of system utilities, I conclude that there is substantial evidence of malicious activity. Immediate actions should include isolating the affected system, conducting a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach, and reviewing access logs and permissions across the environment to mitigate any further potential threats. Additionally, investigating how the malicious script was deployed and executed, as well as checking for changes in user privileges, should be prioritized."
Delete User - Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event log clear events are seen (EventID 1102 in Security log; EventID 104 in System log). The logs for PowerShell, System, and Security channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This type of activity is often associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks after breaching a system.

2. **Account Creation and Deletion:**
   - A user account, `AtomicUser`, was created and then deleted almost immediately. This activity is indicated by Sysmon process events and corroborated by Security logs showing account creation (EventID 4720), enabling (4722), and deletion (4726).

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c net user AtomicUser User2DeletePW! /add & net.exe user AtomicUser /delete` was executed. This command is implicated in abruptly creating and deleting a user account, potentially indicating an attempt to use the account for temporary access or to perform operations under a different account quickly.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` is observed holding multiple high privileges (EventID 4672), necessary to perform actions such as manipulating user accounts and clearing event logs.

5. **Time Changes:**
   - The logs indicate multiple system time changes (EventID 4616 in Security log; EventID 1 in System log). This could be related to attempts to desynchronize logs for further obfuscation.

6. **Tool Execution:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times for clearing logs, suggesting this tool is utilized for log manipulation.

7. **Process Execution:**
   - Various processes executed by `admin_test` through Sysmon logs suggest administrative tasks, but the context of these executions alongside log clearance and account manipulation presents a suspicious picture.

Based on this analysis, the results lean strongly towards indicators of malicious behavior. The combination of log clearance, quick user account manipulation, and privilege escalation patterns generally aligns with attacker activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further movement across the network.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise.
   
2. **Review Network Traffic:**
   - Inspect network logs and traffic for any unusual outbound connections that might indicate data exfiltration.

3. **Audit All Users and Permissions:**
   - Thoroughly audit user accounts and permissions on the network to detect any other misuse or suspicious modifications.

4. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Enforce stricter log monitoring and alert configurations.
   - Consider deploying advanced threat detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate similar activities in the future.

5. **User Awareness & Training:**
   - Initiate campaigns focused on recognizing and responding to incidents related to unauthorized access or suspicious behaviors within the network.

Following these steps will help ensure proper handling of the incident, minimize risk, and improve future security posture."
Overwrite deleted data on C drive,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The event logs show multiple instances of log file clearing:
     - Event ID 1102 in Security Log: This indicates event logs being cleared, which can be a tactic used to cover up malicious activity. This activity was performed by the user `admin_test`.
     - Event ID 104 in System Log: Specific logs for System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by `admin_test`.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the use of wevtutil.exe by `admin_test` to clear logs (Sysmon Event ID 5), indicated by command line usage (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Security`). This is generally done to cover tracks.

3. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - Execution of `cipher.exe /w:C:` by `admin_test` (Sysmon Event ID 1) suggests the potential wiping of free space on the disk, which can be used to prevent forensic recovery of deleted files.
   
4. **Privilege Use:**
   - Multiple **Event ID 4672** (Special privileges assigned to new logon) indicate that `admin_test` had significant privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be used for privilege escalation or other malicious purposes.

5. **Logon Activity:**
   - Event 4624 (Logon) with LogonType 3 (Network) indicates that user `admin_test` logged in from Workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The presence of NTLM instead of more modern authentication protocols could suggest a potential weakness in the authentication configuration.

**Assessment:**
Upon reviewing these logs, the combination of cleared logs, use of utilities to wipe evidence such as `cipher.exe`, and assignment of high privilege levels to `admin_test` constitutes highly suspicious behavior. These are common indicators of an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities or actions that intended to bypass security measures.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread and possible data exfiltration.
   
2. **Deep Investigation:**
   - Perform deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to see if further evidence of compromise exists.
   - Investigate the activities leading to and following the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cipher.exe`.
   - Verify the integrity and scope of accounts being used from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   
3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Review the use of privilege levels and enforce stricter log management policies.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on the use of powerful command-line utilities and administrative actions.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Review and possibly enhance logging configuration to prevent or detect similar activities in the future.
   - Ensure all users, especially those with high privileges like `admin_test`, use stronger authentication methods (e.g., Kerberos instead of NTLM).

Given these findings, the logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity that requires further investigation."
Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious behavior which warrant further scrutiny:

1. **Log Clearance Events:**
   - Log entries in the System log show multiple events with EventID 104, indicating log file clearance activities in both the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the user `admin_test`. This pattern is consistently reflected in the log times and actions:
     - System Log at `2024-10-26 19:28:22`.
     - PowerShell Log at `2024-10-26 19:28:22`.
   - The Security log also documents a security log clearance event, EventID 1102, by the same user `admin_test` at `2024-10-26 19:28:22`.
   - Clearing log files, especially multiple types within a short timeframe, is often associated with attempts to hide traces of malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal the execution of PowerShell with an unusual command line at `2024-10-26 19:28:23`:
     - Command: `powershell.exe & {cmd /c 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe' -c '$env:temp\\test.txt'}`.
   - This command chains PowerShell and the command prompt to encrypt a file using GnuPG (`gpg.exe`). 
   - Such behavior may indicate an attempt to secure or conceal data in transit or to prepare it for exfiltration, which is a known tactic in malware activities.

3. **Events Related to Wevtutil:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility are observed with commands to clear various event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`).
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with these arguments shortly before or after the log clearance events is consistent with an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Generic Administrative Tasks Possibly Related to Reconnaissance:**
   - Systematic execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could imply reconnaissance efforts.
   - Given the timing and user context, these actions by `admin_test` might be investigative steps by an intruder to map user privileges or system characteristics after gaining access.

### Assessment of Situation

The convergence of log clearance operations, use of potentially malicious PowerShell commands, and execution of reconnaissance-related binaries strongly suggests malicious activity. The actions by the `admin_test` user exhibit a typical pattern of post-compromise attack behavior focusing on data concealment and preparation.

### Resolution

Given the evidence of log clearance, suspicion-enhancing command execution, and other reconnaissance activities, the logs fall into the **MALICIOUS** category.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Isolate Affected Systems:**
   - Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or potential lateral movement by the attacker.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to extract relevant data that may indicate the method of entry, goals, and scope of the compromise.

3. **Restore From Clean Backup:**
   - After ensuring no active threats remain, restore the system from a known clean backup if possible and verify its integrity before reconnection to the network.

4. **Log Reviews and Monitoring:**
   - Review logs from surrounding systems for additional indicators of compromise and implement enhanced monitoring to detect similar activities early.

5. **User Education and Password Change:**
   - Implement a mandatory password change for administrative accounts and provide security training to users to raise awareness of suspicious behaviors and potential phishing vectors.

6. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Regularly update and patch systems, apply principle of least privilege, and consider implementing advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Evaluate and refine security policies to mitigate against similar incidents in the future.

This comprehensive approach addresses immediate security threats and helps fortify defenses against future incidents."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"Upon review of the provided event logs, there are several noteworthy observations, particularly concerning potentially suspicious activity:

### 1. Log Clearing Activity:
- **Security Event Log 1102**: This event signifies that the security audit log was cleared. The event was triggered by the user `admin_test`. Clearing these logs without a legitimate reason is often a sign of trying to cover up tracks, typically indicating malicious activity.
- **System Event Log 104**: Similarly, this event shows that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user. Clearing logs can be a sign of malicious intent, especially when done in conjunction with the security logs.

### 2. Command-line Execution:
- **Sysmon EventID 1 (Process creation)**: Various instances of `wevtutil.exe` are recorded, executed by `admin_test`, with the command line that includes ""`cl`"" (clear log) for channels like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This indicates the logs being explicitly cleared through command-line execution using the `wevtutil` tool, supporting the manual action observed in the event logs.

### 3. Use of Potentially Dangerous Command Executions:
- There are instances of usage involving `cmd.exe` to execute potentially dangerous operations, notably use of `plink.exe` (a command-line interface to PuTTY's backend), with credentials provided (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`), which is usually discouraged and indicates auto-login via SSH. This operation could expose the network if misused or used maliciously.

### 4. Legitimate Software Updates Interleaved:
- Extensive log entries show `Microsoft Edge Update` processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. While software updates are regular and legitimate, they are interleaved with other log-clearing activities, which suggests a background of typical system operations amidst potentially suspicious manual actions.

### Assessment:
Given the above analysis, it is evident from the combination of log clearing, use of command line utilities to clear logs, and suspicious command execution related to SSH credentials, the actions strongly suggest potential malicious intent or compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
There is clear evidence of malicious behavior due to unauthorized log clearing, possibly indicative of attempts to cover tracks, and suspicious use of SSH credentials in scripts or automated tasks. This needs immediate attention for deeper forensic analysis, potential mitigation, and response actions to prevent further exploitation or loss.

### Recommendations:
- Investigate the origin of the processes under `admin_test` and review their access permissions and recent activities.
- Perform a full security audit and incident response plan, considering potential lateral movements or data exfiltration.
- Secure the network by updating passwords and enforcing stricter logging policies (e.g., prevent unauthorized log clearing).
- Monitor for similar activities across other hosts or systems connected to the same network.
"
Windows - vssadmin Resize Shadowstorage Volume,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed summary of findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Security Log (EventID: 1102) and System Log (EventID: 104) indicate that logs have been cleared by an account named `admin_test`. This is a suspicious activity as clearing logs may signify an attempt to cover tracks after potential malicious activities.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events (EventID: 4616) show time adjustments made by `LOCAL SERVICE` using `svchost.exe`. The manipulation of system time can often be part of an anti-forensic technique to confuse or disrupt logs and timestamps.

3. **Execution of PowerShell with Elevated Privileges**:
   - Multiple entries in Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to resize shadow storage using `vssadmin`. The command `vssadmin resize shadowstorage` is often associated with managing Volume Shadow Copies, which is a typical attack vector to delete or alter backups.

4. **Processes Execution with Potential Misuse**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various log channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This aligns with malicious behavior intending to remove traces of activity (log cleaning).
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` possibly indicates enumeration activities.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:
- **Log Clearing**: Frequent clearing of logs by `admin_test` suggests possible malicious activity, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities.
- **Potential Anti-Forensic Techniques**: Adjustments to system time and clearing logs can be considered an attempt to obfuscate evidence.
- **Shadow Storage Manipulation**: The precise use of PowerShell to execute shadow storage resizing suggests malicious intent, as such commands can facilitate data exfiltration or destruction.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the patterns observed in the logs—especially the log clearing, system time manipulations, and PowerShell actions—there is significant evidence of an attempt to obscure potentially malicious activities:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that points to a deliberate attempt to cover activities, which strongly indicate malicious behavior. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further damage.
   - Preserve current logs and any available backups for further forensic analysis.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or credentials compromise.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a full memory and disk analysis to uncover hidden or deleted data.
   - Review any recent changes to the system configuration or installed software that might have allowed unauthorized access.

3. **Strengthen Security Measures**:
   - Review and enhance monitoring and logging policies to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Implement stricter access controls and consider implementing multi-factor authentication for critical accounts.
  
4. **Incident Reporting and Response**:

Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain activities and sequences draw concern:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are instances in both security and system logs where the event logs have been cleared:
   - Security log clearing: Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. A cleared security log is often associated with malicious activity, as attackers clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - System log clearing: Event ID 104 shows that logs are being cleared, which again suggests attempts to hide actions.

2. **Suspicious Commands Executed**:
   - There is an execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across various Windows event logs, including Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs. This usage is highly suspicious.
   - An unusual execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no`. These commands are used to modify boot configuration, disabling recovery, which is not typical for standard administrative activity and indicates potential malicious behavior aiming to impede system recovery or diagnostic processes.

3. **Processes and Tools Typically Not Executed by Admins**:
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe` (frequently used to manipulate the event logs) and `bcdedit.exe` should not be commonly used, especially in sequences that align with log clearing activity.

4. **Identity and Access Management**:
   - Events are logged by a single user `admin_test`, highlighting potential misuse or compromise of the account or its privileges.

**Assessment**:
Considering the log clearing, use of powerful command-line utilities in a concerning sequence, and the modification of system recovery settings without a legitimate justification, these activities indicate a strong pattern consistent with malicious behavior aimed at concealing questionable activities.

**Recommendation**:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - Based on the evidence, it is recommended to classify these activities as malicious.
  
**Actions to take**:
- Immediately isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to understand the scope and entry point of the breach.
- Reset passwords and review the access levels for the affected user account `admin_test`.
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerts for log-clearing activities and the execution of sensitive utilities or commands.
- Analyze the activities leading up to and following these logs to assess for potential data exfiltration or lateral movement attempts."
Configure LegalNoticeCaption and LegalNoticeText registry keys to display ransom message,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators point towards malicious activity. Below, I highlight the suspicious or anomalous behaviors identified across the logs.

#### 1. **Clearing of Event Logs**
- **Security Log EventID 1102**: The log file clearance by `admin_test` is concerning, particularly without a corresponding explanation or routine maintenance activity. Malicious actors often clear logs to hide their tracks.

#### 2. **Unauthorized PowerShell Activity**
- **Sysmon Log EventID 1**: There is a PowerShell script execution (ProcessId: 3032) that modifies the Legal Notice Caption and Text in the Windows registry. This script contains a message that every byte on the system's devices was encrypted and instructions to contact an external entity. This matches the typical behavior associated with ransomware, specifically the application of a ransom note.
  
- **PowerShell Log**: The command-line argument for the PowerShell process matches the Sysmon logs detail, confirming the execution of a script with a message related to data encryption and ransom demands.

#### 3. **High Privilege User Activities**
- **EventID 4672**: Multiple instances of high privilege assignments (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) to the account `admin_test` are recorded. This can be typical for admin tasks but could also indicate privilege escalation by a malicious actor, especially given the timing and context around log clearance and PowerShell execution.

#### 4. **Network Activity**
- **Security Log EventID 4624**: Remote access login for `admin_test` from an IP address (192.168.0.102), possibly suggesting external access to the system. Coupled with log clearance and illegitimate PowerShell usage, this suggests potential unauthorized external access.

### Assessment

The above findings highlight a possible security breach characterized by unauthorized log clearance, use of PowerShell to set ransom notes, and potential illicit remote access activity. The pattern is consistent with ransomware attacks such as PYSA (also known as Mespinoza) that leverage such tactics.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Considering the evidence of a likely ransomware attack (script execution with ransom message modification, log clearing for obfuscation, and suspicious privileged user activities), the resolution for this log analysis is **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread across the network.
   - Preserve all logs and system state for forensic analysis.
   - Notify the incident response team to engage and assess the scope and impact immediately.

2. **Investigative Steps**:
   - Analyze network traffic to identify the vector for remote access.
   - Verify the origin of the `admin_test` account activities, particularly remote logins and privilege use.
   - Assess the integrity of backup solutions for restoration possibilities.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Enhance monitoring for unusual administrative activities and event log clearance.
   - Regularly update and patch systems to mitigate vulnerabilities.
   - Implement robust access controls for privileged accounts and monitor for abnormal behavior.

These measures will help in addressing the current threat and elevating the security posture against similar incidents in the future."
Akira Ransomware drop Files with .akira Extension and Ransomnote,"After analyzing the provided logs, several events indicate malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell and Sysmon Logs**: There is clear evidence of a ransomware attack involving an entity called ""Akira."" The logs show that PowerShell was used to generate what appears to be ransomware notes and corrupt file tasks. The PowerShell script's CommandLine generated multiple 'akira_readme.txt' files on the user's desktop, which contain ransom and extortion messages typically associated with ransomware attacks.

2. **System and Security Logs**: The logs show events indicative of log clearing:
   - **EventID 104 and 1102**: Logs in the System, PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared, correlating to actions typical of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks after malicious actions.
   - **Time Adjustments**: The events logged by Windows Time Service suggest changes in system time, which can also be a technique used by attackers to disrupt forensic timelines.

3. **Indicators of Process Execution**: 
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` indicates that system logs were cleared using command-line utilities, further suggesting an attempt to hide malicious activities.
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes were noted, but they generally appear consistent with typical updates unless part of a larger misdirective campaign which wasn't conclusively indicated here.

Given these observations, the resolution of this analysis is **MALICIOUS** due to clear signs of a ransomware attack with significant evidence of file system manipulation and attempts to clear security event logs to hinder detection and analysis.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate your incident response plan, isolate the affected systems to prevent further encryption or potential spread, and start data recovery and system restoration using backup solutions, if available.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Retain all storage and system memory data for deeper forensic analysis post-restoration to understand the full extent of the compromise and how initial access was achieved.
3. **Enhance Security Measures**: Evaluate and enhance monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities. Consider further user education and training to prevent social engineering access vectors such as phishing.
4. **Collaboration with Law Enforcement**: Consider notifying relevant law enforcement with the incident details, particularly when sensitive data could potentially be exposed or further action against the threat actor is needed.
5. **Post-Incident Review and Hardening**: Conduct a thorough post-incident review to address and rectify security shortcomings to prevent future occurrences."
Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several instances of noteworthy activity that could signal potential security concerns. Here are the key observations:

1. **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The Sysmon logs reveal numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is commonly used to manage Windows event logs. This utility is invoked multiple times with identical command-line arguments for clearing logs (cl command). Frequent clearing of logs, particularly from a privileged account, is unusual and suspicious as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks from malicious activity.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs for channels like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security.
   - The Security log contains an event with EventID 1102, indicating the Security log was cleared by the `admin_test` account.
   - The System log contains multiple EventID 104 entries showing that various channels, including System and Windows PowerShell, were cleared. 

3. **Command Execution with PowerShell**: There is an instance of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` executed by the `admin_test` user. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it is often used in attack scenarios for scripting or executing payloads because of its powerful scripting capabilities.

4. **Unusual Command Execution**: An unexpected `cmd.exe` entry executes with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c """"%PROGRAMFILES%\dcrypt""\dcrypt.exe""` which executes an application (`dcrypt.exe`) from a potentially suspicious path using environment variables. This could be seen as suspicious if `dcrypt.exe` is not recognized software for this environment.

5. **Edge Update and Install Activity**: Instances of Microsoft Edge installers and updaters operating under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account appear normal and are less likely related to malicious activities, considering they are typically associated with Windows updates.

6. **Indicators of Potential Account Misuse**: The activity seems concentrated around the `admin_test` account, which executed high-privilege tasks like clearing logs. Frequent log clearing by an administrative account is particularly concerning.

### Assessment:

Given these observations, the activity is **SUSPICIOUS**. The pattern of log clearing, especially of security-related logs, and the execution of potentially suspicious processes likely warrants further investigation. The actions could be an attempt at obfuscation or privileging escalation usually conducted prior to or after a compromise.

### Recommendations for Proceeding:

1. **Investigate `admin_test` Activity**: Examine account activity, any changes in privileges, and check for unauthorized access or abnormal use.
2. **Audit System Usage**: Look for any unauthorized access or signs of lateral movement by identifying established connections, unknown software installations, and other anomalous activities.
3. **Review Cleared Logs**: Use backups if available to try and reconstruct the cleared events, focusing on the timeframe around the clearance for any missed indicators.
4. **Conduct a Threat Hunting Exercise**: Investigate the presence of `dcrypt.exe` and additional context around all PowerShell and cmd.exe commands executed.
5. **Enhance Monitoring**: Tighten monitoring on critical accounts and privilege use, focusing on detection of unauthorized changes or potential breaches in real-time.

Overall, while there is no direct evidence of a compromise, the nature of activities logged is concerning and warrants immediate further investigation to rule out malicious intent or a security breach."
Windows - wbadmin Delete Windows Backup Catalog,"After analyzing the submitted logs, I have identified several key observations and areas of interest that require attention:

### Observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security (EventID: 1102), system (EventID: 104), and PowerShell event logs have been cleared. This is indicated by the use of the `wevtutil cl` command in the Sysmon logs.
     - **Sysmon Event RecordID 17957, 17961, 17965**: Show usage of `wevtutil cl` to clear Application, System, and Security logs.
   - The clearing of logs is a significant indicator of malicious activity, as it is often used to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **Usage of Administrative Tools:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the use of tools like `wbadmin` (Event RecordID: 17983) and `cmd.exe` with the command `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet` (Event RecordID: 17981).
   - This can indicate potential tampering or inappropriate use of backup tools, possibly to either disrupt system recovery or hide traces of other activities.

3. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - A command prompt was used with `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet`, indicating potential attempts to delete backup metadata silently.
   - There were several instances of the `Microsoft Edge Update` process executing with different command lines, which appears to be normal software update procedures beginning at Event RecordID: 17993 and onwards indicating Edge Update.

4. **Suspicious Account Activity:**
   - All suspect actions seem to originate from the ""admin_test"" user account, raising concerns about either the intentional nature of these actions or potential compromise of this account.

### Assessment:

The logs exhibit signs that are strongly indicative of potentially **MALICIOUS** behavior for the following reasons:
- The act of clearing logs is a classic procedure of threat actors post-compromise to obscure their activities.
- Using administrative tools to silently alter or remove system backups can indicate an attempt to weaken the system's recovery capabilities.
- The synchronization of the log-clearing events with the suspicious use of system and administrative tools underscores the likelihood of deliberate, unauthorized actions.

### Guidance:

Immediate actions are recommended as follows:
1. **Alert Response Teams:**
   - Notify your Incident Response (IR) and Security Operations Team immediately to investigate the suspicious activities.

2. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Consider isolating the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or spreading.

3. **Account Review and Securing:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or misuse and ensure all privileged accounts are secured.
   - Consider temporary suspension or additional monitoring of the ""admin_test"" account.

4. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Begin a forensic investigation to capture disk, memory, and network data logs for deeper analysis by the IR team.
   - Utilize backups (if available and not compromised) to verify any unauthorized deletions and system changes.

5. **Review Backup Systems:**
   - Check recent changes to the backup catalog and ensure the integrity and existence of critical system and data backups.

Deploy these findings as part of an immediate security protocol to contain and remediate potential threats effectively."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host (Server002), several key observations suggest potential indicators of malicious activity, especially involving suspicious use of PowerShell and event log clearing.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis

- **PowerShell Execution with Shadow Copy Deletion:**
  - The logs indicate a PowerShell application executing `Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}`. This command is used to delete shadow copies and is often seen in ransomware attacks to prevent recovery through shadow copy restoration.
  - The execution context is `powershell.exe` run by `admin_test`, which could indicate that the user might have elevated permissions or been compromised.

#### Security Log Analysis

- **Security Log Cleared:**
  - Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an attempt to remove traces of unauthorized or malicious activities.
  
- **Time Manipulation:**
  - Event IDs 4616 show time changes on the system, indicating deliberate manipulation, potentially to confuse logging or tamper timestamps on malicious activities.

- **High-Privilege Logon Sessions:**
  - Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 show that `admin_test` had special privileges like SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and SeDebugPrivilege. These privileges allow significant control over the system, possibly for nefarious activities.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Suspicious Process Execution:**
  - Sysmon logs illustrate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands clearing event logs such as `cl Security`, `cl Application`, and `cl System`. This suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common behavior in post-compromise activities.
  
- **Network Activities:**
  - The logs do not explicitly detail outbound network connections or unusual network activity, indicating this report focuses on local/system actions rather than external reconnaissance or data exfiltration.

#### System Log Analysis

- **Time and Log Management:**
  - The System log further confirms time adjustments and `wevtutil.exe` executions, aligning with observations in the Sysmon and Security logs for log clearance.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Given these findings, the activities observed within the logs are highly indicative of malicious activity:

- The execution of commands to delete shadow copies using PowerShell is known to be malicious behavior, typically associated with preventing system recovery and backups restoration.
- Event logs, including security logs, being cleared suggest attempts to erase traces of malicious activities.
- The manipulation of system time can complicate forensic investigations and indicate malicious intent.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

- **Incident Response:**
  - Initiate an incident response to examine the full scope of this activity. Check other systems for similar indicators and assess the compromise level.
  
- **User Investigation:**

- **Log Monitoring:**
  - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar future attempts at PowerShell misuse and log clearing.
  
- **Backups and Recovery:**
  - Ensure that redundant, secure, and off-site backups are available to mitigate damage from potential shadow copy deletions.

The provided analysis highlights signs of compromise with evidence pointing to attempted evasion and data destruction actions on the monitored system."
Windows - Stop service by killing process,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators point towards potentially suspicious activities, particularly in the context of log clearing and service manipulations. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` within a short timeframe. Event logs clearing is usually a red flag in security monitoring as attackers might do this to cover their tracks after a compromise or nefarious activity. Relevant events:
     - System log: Event ID 104 for the System and Windows PowerShell channels.
     - Security log: Event ID 1102 indicating the security audit log was cleared.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple executions involving Windows utilities (like `wevtutil`) and system commands (`taskkill`) were observed:
     - `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear specific event logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational). Cleared logs can indicate an attempt to hide specific system or security log entries.
     - `cmd.exe` was invoked to run `taskkill.exe` to forcefully terminate `spoolsv.exe`, an unusual action that may be part of an attacker's script to disable services and evade detection.

3. **Service and Process Manipulations:**
   - A sequence of service-related events, including the termination of the Print Spooler (Event ID 7031) and the command-line execution to stop `spoolsv.exe`.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The Sysmon logs also indicate executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which on their own are not typically suspicious but, in the context of log clearing, can be used by an attacker to gather information about the system or confirm successful access.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:
Based on the combination of log clearing actions, service disruptions, and use of command-line utilities to manipulate system processes, this could be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or configure the system maliciously. The logs suggest a higher likelihood of malicious activity due to the following:
- Use of administrative privileges (`admin_test`) to manipulate logs and services.
- Activity occurring tightly within specific timestamps suggests a coordinated task, often seen in exfiltration or setup scripts.

### Threats and Risks:
- **Potential Compromise:** The user `admin_test` might have been compromised or engaged in unauthorized activities.
- **Evaded Detection:** The clearing of logs may have removed evidence of more serious breaches or lateral movements in the network.

### Resolution and Guidance:
Given the context and actions noted in the logs, the activity is classified as:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs show a clear indication of potential unauthorized access and attempts to hide activity on the system.

### Next Steps:
- **Immediate Review:** Conduct a thorough review of the user `admin_test` account for unauthorized access.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Implement a forensic analysis to recover any cleared logs or correlate other potential indicators of compromise.
- **Security Hardening:** Apply enhanced logging, particularly with regards to security and Sysmon configurations, to preempt future attempts at shadowing activities.
- **Account Security:** Reset credentials and enforce strong password policies and multifactor authentication for privileged accounts.

By implementing these measures, the organization can mitigate further risks and address any existing vulnerabilities."
Windows - Stop service using Service Controller,"### Detailed Analysis

After examining the provided event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and merit further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log Clearing:** Event ID 1102 in the Security logs shows that the security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is typically uncommon during regular administrative activities and can be indicative of malicious intent to hide traces of unauthorized activities.
   - **Other Log Clearings:** In the System logs, Event IDs 104 display that logs for System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the same user `admin_test`. Frequent cleaning of logs without valid administrative reasons should be considered suspicious.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The frequent execution of various processes by the user `admin_test`, such as `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and `cmd.exe` executing the command `sc.exe stop spooler`, is unusual. While these actions can sometimes be legitimate, they are often associated with malicious activities, such as attempts to disable security mechanisms (e.g., stopping the spooler service).
   - The use of the `whoami.exe` tool may indicate an attempt to verify user permissions and identity, often seen in reconnaissance phases by attackers.
   - **Time Manipulation:** Time adjustment related events (Event ID 4616) are noted, indicating the system time was altered, potentially to facilitate the hiding of activity trails or to confuse forensic analysis.

3. **Processes with Unusual Commands:**
   - The appearance of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in Temp directories with command-line arguments related to service registration (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`) is suspicious without a routine software update context.
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with `/c`, typically a command-line switch for command execution, can be misused. Legitimate updates typically do not require such operations unless during installation or removal.

4. **Misuse of System Utilities:**
   - The processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` have unusual parent-child relationships, suggesting they might be repurposed for non-standard activities.

### Clear Assessment and Risks

- **Risks Identified:** 
  - The combination of cleared logs, stopped services, and potential misuse of administrative utilities suggests an attempt to obscure malicious activities.
  - Time manipulation, if unauthorized, can undermine time-based security mechanisms and logs' integrity.
  - The presence of these activities across various forms of logs indicates a potential compromise of the system.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

While there is not enough information at this moment to definitively label these activities as malicious, the aggregation of these event log findings demonstrates actions that align with potential malicious behavior. It is recommended that further investigation be conducted, including:

- Reviewing user `admin_test` for policy violations and checking account activity for unauthorized access.
- Conducting a Malware scan with updated definitions.
- Increasing monitoring on the affected machine and conducting a full threat assessment.

Furthermore, it's critical to review any unauthorized changes or system misconfigurations and restore from secure backups if necessary."
Windows - Delete Backup Files,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the observed activities and their potential implications:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity

1. **Event Log Clearing (System and Security Logs)**
   - **System Log EventID 104 & Security Log EventID 1102:** Indicate that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system or performing malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` (the Eventing Command Line Utility) suggests that the logs being cleared were not accidental. The use of this utility to clear multiple logs (`System`, `Security`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell`) is a clear sign that someone with potentially malicious intent attempted to cover their tracks.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**
   - **Sysmon Log Event:** The command executed by `cmd.exe` to delete various backup files and formats (e.g., `.VHD`, `.bac`, and `.bak`) is highly suspicious. This could be indicative of an attempt to remove system restore points or backup files, often a strategy employed by ransomware or wiper malware.

4. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level**
   - Several utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) were run with a high integrity level by the same user. While these utilities themselves aren't inherently malicious, their usage along with the log-clearing actions is concerning.

5. **Repeated Execution of Elevated Privileges**
   - **Security Log EventID 4672 and 4624:** Multiple entries show the granting of special privileges to the `SYSTEM` account repeatedly in a short time span. While these processes are typical for some legitimate activities, in conjunction with the log clearing, they may highlight an attempt at privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

### Assessment and Recommendations

Given the analysis, the logs point toward a serious security incident. The actions observed align with tactics commonly employed by malicious actors to obfuscate their activities and hinder forensic investigation. 

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

#### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement by the attacker.
   - Preserve any additional evidence for forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the attack.

2. **Perform a Thorough Inspection:**
   - Utilize a clean forensic toolset to perform a full system integrity check and malware scan on the affected host.
   - Analyze network traffic to detect any potential exfiltration of data or additional lateral movement from the compromised machine.

3. **Review Access Policies:**
   - Ensure strong access control policies are enforced, and segregate administrative duties to minimize the potential impact of compromised accounts.
   - Consider implementing additional auditing and monitoring on administrative actions.

4. **Enhance Log Management:**
   - Implement a robust log retention policy ensuring that logs are exported to a secure, centralized log management system, providing detection and response capabilities even if local logs are deleted.

By addressing these issues promptly and comprehensively, you can mitigate the impact of this incident and bolster your security posture against future threats."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure CLI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs display several commands being executed, specifically involving the Azure CLI (`az`). The suspicious part here is the command `az ad user delete`, which attempts to delete a user `atomicredteam@yourdomain.com`. Actions involving user deletions from Active Directory, especially if unexpected or unauthorized, are potentially dangerous. It indicates an attempt to manipulate user accounts, which could be part of an insider threat or external compromise if executed by an unauthorized actor.

#### Security Logs
1. **Event ID 1102**: The security event log has been cleared. This is generally suspicious behavior as it is a common tactic to hide evidence of malicious activity. The action was performed by a user named `admin_test`.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: Two logon events for the `SYSTEM` account are noted with special privileges. While logons by `SYSTEM` can be normal, it needs to be evaluated in the context of other activities and any deviation from regular behavior patterns.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. The sysmon logs show multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command for various logs, including System, Application, and Security logs. This reinforces the suspicious clearing of event logs and aligns with Event ID 1102 from the Security logs.

2. The actions are associated with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which matches the user clearing the event logs in the Security logs.

3. Multiple processes of PowerShell are executed with commands relevant to Azure operations and command line manipulation.

#### Application Logs
Activity seems consistent with regular system maintenance or application updates, like updates for Microsoft Edge. However, in conjunction with the PowerShell and Sysmon logs indicating potentially unauthorized activities, these typical actions need scrutiny to ensure they are not run by a compromised service.

#### System Logs
The confirmed clearing of the System log (`Event ID 104`) was conducted by `admin_test`, which contributes to the sequence of potentially malicious actions performed by this user account.

### Assessment of the Situation
The observed behavior in these logs demonstrates:
- **Potential Malicious Intent**: The deletion of AD users via PowerShell, coupled with the clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, suggests an effort to remove traces of these modifications.
- **User Account 'admin_test'**: This account is consistently involved across cleared log entries and suspicious Azure-related commands, indicating it could be compromised or used for unauthorized activities.

### Conclusion
These findings strongly point towards **MALICIOUS** activity within the logs. The main indicators being the unauthorized use of PowerShell scripts to delete Active Directory users and the subsequent clearing of event logs to hide these actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
2. **Account Audit**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or signs of compromise. Change passwords and review account permissions.
3. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response to assess the extent of the potential breach and ensure all malicious actors are removed from the environment.
4. **Logging**: Implement or enhance logging mechanisms and monitoring solutions to detect such activities in real-time.
5. **Review Security Policies**: Update and enforce security policies that require alerting and managerial approval for actions like event log clearance or sensitive PowerShell operations.

Implementing these steps should help mitigate immediate risks and reinforce the security posture against similar threats in the future."
Windows - wbadmin Delete systemstatebackup,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several notable observations suggest suspicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**: The logs indicate that the security log (Event ID 1102) was cleared by the user `admin_test`. The system log and `Windows PowerShell` logs (Event ID 104) were also cleared. Such actions are often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following potentially unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Time Manipulation**: We see several events suggesting that the system time was altered (Event IDs 4616, with PreviousTime/NewTime values). Changing system time can be used to manipulate logs further or execute time-sensitive tasks outside of normal schedules.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility was used multiple times to clear event logs (`cl` command in the command line), which aligns with attempts to conceal activity. The utility executions are linked to the same user account `admin_test`.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: Several events indicate the user `admin_test` was assigned high privileges (Event ID 4672 with privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege), which are notably sensitive and align with administrative activities.

5. **Command Execution**: A command executed via `cmd.exe` (Event ID 1) involves deleting system state backups using `wbadmin`. The command `wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0` indicates the removal of system state backups, which can be a deliberate attempt to eliminate recovery options or cleanup measures post-compromise.

6. **System Activity**: Various instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes and related command-line activities were noted. While not inherently suspicious, the timing and frequency warrant additional scrutiny, especially if they coincide with an unusual activity window or observed installs.

Given these observations, there's compelling evidence pointing towards potentially malicious activity or at least, high-risk suspicious behavior, with attempts to obfuscate activity through log clearing and backup deletion. 

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to assess any further context around the log clearing and time manipulation.
- Review any network connections and communication during the time of the observed events.
- Investigate the admin_test account for unauthorized activities or escalations in privileges.
- Evaluate file system integrity, particularly focusing on any deleted or altered backup data.
- If feasible, restore and secure logs from backup, if available, to further trace activities.
"
Change User Password - Windows,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**: 
   - Event IDs `104` in the System log and `1102` in the Security log indicate that the event logs for the system, Windows PowerShell, and security have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is commonly associated with malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their actions.

2. **Suspicious User Activity**:
   - A user account `AtomicAdministrator` was created under the supervision of `admin_test` who appears to have administrative privileges based on Event ID `4720`. This event is immediately suspicious due to the timing and the nature of account creation and manipulation.
   - The password for `AtomicAdministrator` was set with a potentially strong or complex password (""HuHuHUHoHo283283@dJD""), suggesting an attempt to secure the account post-creation (Event ID `4724`).

3. **System Time Modification**:
   - Events with ID `4616` indicate system time changes. While it can be benign, when combined with other malicious indicators, it may suggest tampering to confuse or falsify timestamps.

4. **Execution of Command Line Tools**:
   - The execution of command-line commands such as `net user` to manage user accounts, reflected in the Sysmon logs (e.g., EventID `1`), is suspicious given the context of cleared logs and newly created user accounts. The command `cmd.exe /c net user AtomicAdministrator User2ChangePW! /add` suggests attempts to modify user credentials, which could be a precursor or an action of privilege escalation or backdoor setup.

5. **Repeated EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - Although numerous logs indicate `Microsoft Edge Update` activities, this in itself is not inherently suspicious unless accompanied by other malicious behaviors. It appears routine, but given the other log activities, it would be wise to ensure the legitimacy of these update tasks.

**Assessment:**
The logs exhibit signs of potentially unauthorized and malicious activity. The clearing of logs, creation and manipulation of user accounts, and execution of command-line tools for account management under potentially misleading conditions strongly suggest malicious actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the purpose and recent activities of the account `admin_test`, including any external connections or data transfers.
- Ensure `AtomicAdministrator` and any administrator-level accounts are verified and, if not essential, are disabled or removed from the system.
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit of `Server002`, including malware scans and a review of all installed software, especially any unauthorized tools.
- Assess network traffic for signs of data exfiltration or communication with known malicious domains.
- Implement stricter logging and monitoring to capture and alert on similar events in the future."
PureLocker Ransom Note,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events and activities stand out, which can be categorized as suspicious or potentially indicative of malicious activity.

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - Multiple instances of log files being cleared using the `wevtutil` command by the user `admin_test`. It's unusual for a legitimate user to clear logs, especially the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, as it can indicate attempts to cover tracks related to unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` (clear logs) commands particularly targeting Application, System, and Security logs. The presence of these entries suggests a deliberate action, likely intended to obfuscate actions performed on the system.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that echoes ""T1486 - Purelocker Ransom Note"", which is indicative of a ransomware act. The T1486 reference corresponds to a MITRE ATT&CK tactic for data encryption for impact, a typical ransomware behavior.

3. **Privilege Context:**
   - The processes are being run with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges, which aligns with actions requiring elevated privileges, such as clearing event logs and potentially malicious configurations or updates.

4. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous EdgeUpdate related executions can be seen, possibly indicating update operations. However, this could also be leveraged by adversaries to carry out malicious updates if the update mechanism is compromised. No direct indicators of compromise appear linked to these executions in this context.

### Assessment:
The pattern of activity, especially the clearing of event logs, execution of `wevtutil.exe` to explicitly clear logs, and the creation of a ransomware note, indicates strongly suspicious behavior. These actions together suggest an attempt to execute and then cover up malicious activities, particularly related to ransomware deployment.

### Resolution:
Based on the findings, the logs contain actionable indicators of potential compromise, primarily through the presence of ransomware-related activities and attempts to clear system logs to cover tracks.
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. Immediately initiate a full forensic investigation of the host to determine the extent of the compromise.
2. Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or escalation.
3. Perform a thorough review of all administrative actions and credentials used, ensuring there has been no unauthorized privilege escalation.
4. Restore from clean backups where necessary, following thorough verification of data integrity.
5. Implement enhanced monitoring and alert configurations to detect similar activities in the future, with a focus on logging and process execution.
6. Consider notifying relevant internal and external stakeholders about the breach for ongoing support and compliance needs."
Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious behavior that potentially signify malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearance**: 
    - Event ID `1102` indicates that the security audit logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, we observe log clearance commands (`wevtutil.exe cl`) executed for Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell channels, all by the same user. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of Sdelete**:
    - The Windows PowerShell log and System log contain evidence of the use of `sdelete.exe`, a tool known for secure file deletion. The command integrates into a PowerShell script that runs through `powershell.exe`. The involvement of `sdelete.exe` suggests potential data destruction, a deliberate action often linked to malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Multiple operations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `sdelete.exe`, and PowerShell execution with specific paths indicative of proton payloads are noted. These activities, especially clearing event logs and deleting specific files securely, strongly suggest premeditated actions that go beyond standard operational behavior.

4. **Admin Account Misuse**:
   - The log-in activity features critical system tools executed under the `admin_test` account with high integrity levels. Misuse of privileged accounts through suspicious actions is a red flag for an ongoing compromise.

5. **Indications of Tactics from Red Team Exercises**:
   - The path and naming such as ""AtomicRedTeam"" closely align with known cybersecurity attack simulation exercises. The simulation exercise or unauthorized red team activities align with observed activities in this log sequence.

Given the combination of log cleansing operations, secure deletion of files, and typical adversarial techniques seen in these logs, there is a strong indicator of:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
1. Immediate containment actions are advised, such as isolating the host and terminating suspicious processes.
2. Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the full scope and impact of the compromise.
3. Review and enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to prevent future malicious tampering.
4. Validate account usage, analyze user permissions, and consider rotating credentials, especially for the `admin_test` account, to secure further entry points.
5. Potentially engage an Incident Response team or escalate to cybersecurity authorities based on the impact assessment. 

Given the events' resemblance to simulated attack exercises, ensure any red team engagements are verified and aligned with the organization's scope and consent."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"## Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided Windows logs, several suspicious activities stand out that merit closer examination:

1. **Use of `vssadmin.exe`:**
   - The command `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` was executed. This command is commonly used by ransomware to remove volume shadow copies in order to prevent data recovery. Moreover, it was executed from a `cmd.exe` process that was spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, an unusual parent process for such a command.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events (`EventID: 1`) show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear event logs (e.g., `cl Security`, `cl Application`, `cl System`). The clearing of these logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity, often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Command Execution Context:**
   - The events were executed under the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` with an integrity level of `High`. This suggests that the commands were executed with administrative privileges, granting the potential to perform system-wide changes or deletions.

4. **Sequence of Events:**
   - The timestamps reveal a rapid execution of potentially destructive commands, such as clearing event logs and deleting shadow copies, which is characteristic of automation scripts used in attacks.

5. **Powershell Usage:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command to check for shadow copies using `vssadmin.exe list shadows | findstr`. The use of such commands in a scripted manner shortly followed by destructive actions is consistent with malicious activity aimed at understanding the environment before deleting backups.

## Assessment:

Based on the activities observed in the logs:
- **Indicators of malicious activity:**
  - Execution of `vssadmin.exe` to delete shadow copies.
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
  - PowerShell activity checking for shadow copies.
  - Context of execution under administrative privileges.
  
These activities strongly indicate an attack sequence attempting to disrupt recovery mechanisms and obfuscate evidence of prior activities, which are typical tactics in ransomware attacks or unauthorized access scenarios.

## Resolution: MALICIOUS

- The pattern and sequence of commands (deletion of shadow copies, clearing of event logs) are characteristic of malicious activities aiming to impair data recovery options and erase investigative leads, confirming a high likelihood of compromise.

## Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further spread.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the extent and impact.
   - Identify and preserve any remaining log data outside this event window to aid in root cause analysis.

2. **Post-Incident:**
   - Evaluate and enhance endpoint security policies to detect similar patterns.
   - Review user account activities and permissions, especially for `admin_test`.
   - Implement centralized logging and alerting mechanisms for critical security events like log clearing and shadow copy manipulation.
"
Logoff System - Windows,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon examination of the provided logs, various patterns of behavior have emerged that warrant consideration:

1. **Log File Clearing (System & Security Logs):**
   - The logs indicate that a user named `admin_test` cleared the System (`EventID: 104`) and Security (`EventID: 1102`) logs at almost the same time (`2024-10-26 22:08:32`). This act of log manipulation is often associated with techniques used to cover tracks after conducting unauthorized activity. 

2. **Utility Usage (Sysmon Logs):**
   - There is repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various log types (`Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). Clearing logs using wevtutil suggests an attempt to erase evidence, which is typically suspicious unless it is part of a routine administrative task or part of a scripted maintenance procedure authorized by the organization.
   - The frequent execution of console applications like `cmd.exe`, running commands such as `shutdown /l`, is peculiar as well. While not inherently malicious, without context, these actions could serve as indicators of unexpected behavior.

3. **Process Activity (Sysmon Logs):**
   - `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\HOSTNAME.EXE` executions are observed. These tools are not inherently malicious but often used to gather system and user information. Execution in rapid sequence suggests a script or an automated task.
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate` processes are being executed regularly. This might be a legitimate update process for Microsoft Edge, but the use of a temporary directory and multiple registrations are noteworthy. 

### Assessment

The actions observed in the logs, particularly the clearing of logs without a clear legitimate purpose and the usage of command line utilities to clear logs, redirect command output, and potentially manipulate system state (e.g., shutting down the system), are clear indicators of **SUSPICIOUS** activity. None of the evidence conclusively indicates 100% malicious behavior, such as the deployment of malware or a security breach, but the activities align with potential compromise or unauthorized administrative actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Action:**
  1. **Verify Legitimate Use:** Validate whether any scheduled tasks or maintenance responsibilities correspond to these actions. Check with the `admin_test` user or relevant department.
  2. **User Activity Monitoring:** Check other logs or user activities including authentication logs to ensure the `admin_test` account wasn’t being misused.

- **Further Investigation:**
  1. **Review Recent Changes:** Since logs were cleared, review file integrity logs or backups prior to the event time for any unauthorized changes on the system.
  2. **Isolate and Inspect:** If evidence of unauthorized conduct mounts, isolate the host for a comprehensive forensic analysis to prevent further potential breaches.

- **Preventive Steps:**
  1. **Enhance Monitoring:** Implement stricter logging, especially around sensitive operations such as log clearing, and enforce alerting on similar activities for early warning.
  2. **Credentials Audit:** Review and, if necessary, rotate credentials associated with accounts that performed suspicious activities.

### Resolution

Considering the balance of indicators, the activity within these logs is determined to be **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is highly recommended to clarify the nature of the actions observed and ensure system integrity."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure AD PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest arise indicative of potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearance (Event ID 1102, Event ID 104)**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the clearance of significant logs such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell by the user 'admin_test'. These logs contain Event ID 1102 and 104, which are standard identifiers for log clearance events. This is typically seen as an attempt to cover tracks and is a common behavior associated with malicious actions.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts**:
   - A PowerShell command related to Azure AD interaction is observed (`Remove-AzureADUser -ObjectId $userprincipalname`). This command is notable because it can be used to remove users from Azure AD, which has implications for account management and possible data exfiltration.
   - The command is executed as part of a PowerShell execution chain often associated with administrative tasks or automated scripting environments.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil` for Clearing Logs**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used extensively to clear event logs (as seen in numerous Sysmon events). Its invocation is directly tied to the log clearance events mentioned earlier. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs, especially by a non-standard administrative account or outside of maintenance windows, is highly suspicious.

4. **Anomalous Activity via SYSTEM-level Processes**:
   - Several processes (such as `Taskhostw.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`) are executed under SYSTEM integrity level indicative of a high level of privilege possibly pointing towards a privilege escalation attempt or successful compromise.

5. **High Privilege Assignments**:
   - Logs indicating the assignment of high-level privileges appear frequently, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which provides debugging and related high-level access rights typically necessary for system administration or malicious exploitation.

6. **Presence of Microsoft Edge Updates Logs**:
   - While the Edge Update processes are legitimate, the concurrent suspicious log activities create a backdrop of potential misuse.

Given these observations, it is clear that events within these logs indicate unusual and, potentially, malicious behavior, especially around the manual clearing of logs which is non-standard under normal operational procedures. 

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: 
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
  - Initiate a full forensic investigation to uncover any additional indicators of compromise and understand the scope of the attacker’s activity.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Identify any remote connections established around the time of these log entries for possible command and control channels.
  - Review accounts and their last activities to identify any unauthorized changes or deletions in Azure AD.
  - Conduct a detailed review of user 'admin_test's' activity and access logs.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Review and potentially revoke current permissions for 'admin_test' and any other accounts showing similar activity patterns.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring, logging, and alerting for administrative commands, especially those involving log manipulation.
  - Increase awareness and training on the importance of integrity in log management."
Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"As a senior security analyst scrutinizing the event logs, the following key points emerge from the analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of event log clearing (`EventID: 104` in System and `EventID: 1102` in Security). The logs were cleared for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels by the user `admin_test`. This is often done to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - A suspicious command is seen in the Sysmon logs where `cmd.exe` ran `/c net.exe stop spooler` (ProcessId `5856`). Stopping the Print Spooler service (`spoolsv.exe`) is a common step in various attack vectors, notably the PrintNightmare vulnerability exploitation.

3. **Process Activity:**
   - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`cl` command) across different channels, namely Application, System, and Security, indicate deliberate log clearing activities.
   - Intelligence-level of processes being ‘High’ is a concern as this indicates operations with elevated permissions.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - There is an event indicating a time change (`EventID: 4616`) which can be a sign of a time stomp, a technique to alter timestamps to avoid detection.

5. **High Privilege Assignment:**
   - `admin_test` was granted extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and more. Excessive privileges could be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### Evidence of Malicious Activity:

- **The combination** of log-clearing events, stopping critical Windows services, and execution of commands that are associated with obfuscation and avoiding detection suggest a definite likelihood of malicious intent.

### Assessment:

Based on the above observations, there is substantial evidence of actions resembling known malicious behavior patterns:

- **Log deletion to erase traces:** An attacker might be trying to hide their activity.
- **Stopping critical services such as Print Spooler:** This could disrupt services or exploit vulnerabilities.
- **High privileges execution by `admin_test`:** Suggests the possibility of compromise of this user account.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Review of the `admin_test` Account:** 
   - Verify the integrity and activity related to this account.
   - Ensure account credentials are reset if necessary and security measures are reinforced.

2. **Investigate Command Execution:**
   - Review any tasks or jobs related to `cmd.exe` and `net.exe`.

3. **Comprehensive System Scan:**
   - Initiate a robust antivirus/malware scan across the affected system.

4. **Review and Restore Event Logs:**
   - Where possible, recover and review cleared logs for further indicators of compromise.

5. **Monitor Network and Systems Activity:**
   - Implement intensified monitoring to detect further anomalous behavior, especially activities originating from or targeting the compromised host.

6. **Enhance Logging and Alerts:**
   - Ensure that system logging configurations cannot be manipulated without authorization, and enhance alerts for suspicious activities.

### Final Resolution: 

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate activity characteristic of system compromise and malicious behavior. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential threats."
