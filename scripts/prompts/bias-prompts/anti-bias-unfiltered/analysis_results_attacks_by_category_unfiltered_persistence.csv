COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations that indicate potentially malicious activities occurring on the system:

**Suspicious Behavior and Indicators:**

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple events indicate the execution of PowerShell with suspicious command lines. The PowerShell script includes commands to create registry keys within `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID`, which mirrors techniques used to establish persistence via COM hijacking. The registry keys suggest manipulation to load a DLL (`T1546.015_calc.dll`) potentially for malicious purposes.
   - The execution path for the DLL is within a temporary directory, often associated with suspicious or transient operations: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\T1546.015_calc.dll`.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - PowerShell initiated `rundll32.exe` with arguments to execute COM object CLSID `{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}`, indicative of execution evasion techniques.
   - This sequence of events correlates with known attack methodologies such as those used by 'Atomic Red Team', a known adversary simulation framework. The presence of these artifacts might denote either testing or active exploitation, depending on context.

3. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The event logs reveal that system event logs, security logs, and specific Windows logs such as the PowerShell log were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or suspicious operations.

4. **User and System Context:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears frequently in log events that involve elevated privileges executing tasks such as registry manipulation or log clearance. Actions performed by this account should be further investigated to determine whether such tasks align with its expected role or if there has been a potential account compromise.
   
5. **Consistency with Known Malicious Frameworks:**
   - The presence of path fragments, such as those pointing to ""AtomicRedTeam,"" indicates potential use or testing via red team operations which might mean simulated malicious activities. If these operations weren't authorized, this raises concerns about a potential breach or misuse of red team tools.

**Assessment:**
The collected evidence suggests a high likelihood of unauthorized or malicious activity on the investigated host. The usage of PowerShell to manipulate registry settings and execute DLLs, combined with the clearing of event logs, strongly points to a deliberate attempt to evade detection, characteristic of sophisticated attacks or penetration tests.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the behaviors noted in the logs, these activities are consistent with known attack patterns rather than routine or benign operations. The presence of registry modifications intended to establish persistence, coupled with the clearance of logs, suggests an attempt to establish a foothold within the network covertly and evade detection.

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**
- Immediately isolate Server002 to prevent potential lateral movement and further compromise.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the isolated host, focusing on the PowerShell and registry changes identified.
- Validate with the security team and organizational directives if there was sanctioned use of any red team exercises involving `Atomic Red Team` within this timeframe.
- Review user `admin_test` activities, including authentication logs and resource access, to ensure there is no internal compromise.
- Notify relevant internal teams and consider involving incident response services to support further investigation."
IFEO Global Flags,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious and malicious activities are observed, which require detailed explanation:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple log files (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`) were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs, as indicated by events with command lines targeting `cl` (clear) operations for various log channels.
   - This log clearing activity is often malicious or suspicious, as attackers frequently clear logs to cover their trails. 

2. **Registry Modification via Command Line**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry settings for `notepad.exe`'s `Image File Execution Options` and `SilentProcessExit`.
   - Specifically, adding global flags and monitoring configurations, which might suggest an attempt at persistence or hijacking a legitimate application.
   - These registry modifications are known techniques used in malware attacks for gaining persistence or executing payloads via hijacked processes.

3. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Normal time synchronization activities were observed, which do not appear malicious. However, similar event timestamps around system time and kernel time events can obfuscate true logged activity times post-log clearing.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There is a high volume of `Microsoft Edge Update` related logs, which, while possibly legitimate, could also act as a cover for lateral movement or data exfiltration activities if compromised.
   - Each Edge update session, being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, is of high integrity level, indicating systemic administrative control.

5. **General Process Creation Activity**:
   - The processes such as `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are typically legitimate but could be suspicious when combined with log clearing and registry modifications.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may be part of recon operations within a potentially compromised system environment.

### Assessment

Based on the noted activities:

1. The log clearing and registry manipulation indicate potentially **MALICIOUS** behavior.
2. The consistent use of elevated and system-level processes for updates and modifications, while common, are anomalous when paired with log-clearing efforts.
3. The presence of `Microsoft Edge Update` malware is low, but awareness is critical due to the timing overlap with suspicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate investigation into `admin_test` user activities and credentials to determine account legitimacy.
- Initiate a full audit trail and forensic analysis to identify access patterns pre-log clearing.
- Analyze registry states for signs of hijacked or unknown persistence mechanisms.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns that could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command and control server.
- Consider isolating affected systems to prevent potential spread or further data loss.

The observed behaviors highlight the need for swift action to validate any unauthorized access and address potential system compromise."
Bits download using desktopimgdownldr.exe (cmd),"Upon examining the given logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially suspicious activity that warrant further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - In the Security log, there is an entry where the event log was cleared (`EventID: 1102`) by a user named `admin_test`.
   - In the System log, there are multiple entries (`EventID: 104`) indicating that the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs were cleared. Clearing event logs can be used by malicious actors to hide their tracks.

2. **Processes and Command-Line Activity:**
   - Throughout the Sysmon logs, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with a `cl` (clear) command on different logs (Application, System, Security) stands out (`EventID: 1`). This directly correlates with the log clearing events detected in other logs. The user responsible is `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting someone with administrator privileges executed these commands.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with potentially malicious command lines, as seen in the log entry where a command utilizes a URL from an external address (`desktopimgdownldr.exe` usage linked to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/`). This URL is associated with potentially suspicious behavior as it references a publicly available security testing framework.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The processes that executed the aforementioned suspicious commands were running with High integrity levels, showing they had elevated privileges. Additionally, many of these tasks were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are running with various command line operations and could appear unusual. However, they seem to follow a legitimate software update process for Microsoft Edge and don't immediately raise red flags in the context of typical software behavior on a Windows machine.

Based on the findings above, there are clear signs of actions taken to potentially obscure activities or manipulate system state, notably the clearing of crucial event logs, which often signifies attempts to cover tracks by malicious actors.

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the user account `admin_test` to verify if there is unauthorized access or compromise.
- Review any related user activity logs, network logs, and potentially impacted jump points for additional context and correlation.
- Consider implementing tighter security controls and monitoring around log management and access to critical administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
- Check the security posture of `Server002` and ensure vulnerabilities are patched, and best practices for log retention and audit are enforced."
Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"To investigate the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the entries across the System, Application, Sysmon, Security logs, and address any potential indicators of compromise.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Several ""LogFileCleared"" events across different channels (ID 104) are observed in the System log. An account `admin_test` was used to clear logs from the ‘System’ and 'Windows PowerShell' channels. Similarly, Security log (ID 1102) was cleared. This can be a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after a malicious action.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which were executed by `admin_test`. The command lines for these events include clearing various log channels, indicating an attempt to remove traces related to activities performed on the system. 

3. **Potentially Malicious CMD Commands:**
   - The command-line usage observed for `cmd.exe` indicates registry manipulation to change screensaver settings to an ""evilscreensaver.scr"", a possible attempt to set up a persistence mechanism or payload execution. This is often associated with malware behavior.

4. **Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are persistent indications of high-level integrity processes executed by `admin_test`, showing several potentially harmful actions performed with elevated privileges, including backup and registry changes.

5. **Use of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`:**
   - The entries with Microsoft Edge Update processes are legitimate Microsoft processes. However, one entry shows an execution from a temporary directory which should be verified for legitimacy.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The activities related to clearing logs, and the execution of potentially harmful commands with elevated privileges are highly indicative of malicious activity. The combination of clearing multiple logs and manipulating system settings in a suspicious manner suggests an attempt to avoid detection while executing potentially harmful activities.

### Resolution:

- Based on the evidence provided, the logs reflect activity that is consistent with malicious behavior:
  1. Log clearing attempts.
  2. Suspicious command-line operations modifying registries in a manner that can be utilized for persistence or payload execution.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage.
   - Initiate a deeper forensic investigation to identify and possibly recover evidence before it is lost.

2. **Log Review and Analysis:**
   - Collect and secure all available logs from the time surrounding these events for further detailed analysis.
   - If possible, review file integrity and execute scans with updated antivirus/anti-malware solutions.

3. **Review User Account Activity:**
   - Investigate the account `admin_test` for any unauthorized activity or potential compromise, and consider resetting credentials.
   - Determine if this user account should exist. If not, this account should be removed, and audit logs should be reviewed to identify other unauthorized accounts.

4. **Review Registry Changes:**
   - Revert any unauthorized registry changes made by the processes identified.
   - Assess any additional persistence mechanisms or payloads configured through registry or scheduled tasks.

5. **Improve Monitoring and Response:**
   - Enhance monitoring on log clearing activities and unusual command executions. 
   - Set up alerts for similar suspicious activities and regularly audit critical systems and configurations. 

Engaging in these steps is crucial to contain and mitigate the threat while ensuring the security of network and systems."
Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"Upon careful examination of the provided event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command line utility was executed multiple times to clear logs from Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels. This is indicated by multiple instances of the command with arguments `cl Security`, `cl System`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. Clearing logs is a tactic often employed by threat actors to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **Privilege Escalation & Usage of High Privileges:**
   - The account `admin_test` is seen with several privilege-granting events (EventID 4672) with a wide range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes if misused.
   - The log includes a `cmd.exe` command execution that involves adding a registry value (`reg add` command) which could suggest persistence or modification of system behavior.
   
3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Potentially malicious registry modification: The event with CMD `cmd.exe` involving a `reg add` command modifying registry entrails to add `TestDVCPlugin`, pointing to the `amsi.dll`. Changing registry entries is a tactic for persistence or altering the system's operation.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` right after clearing the logs could indicate reconnaissance activities to understand the execution context.

4. **Sysmon Logs Indications:**
   - The heavy and rapid use of `conhost.exe` associated with `wevtutil.exe` operations is abnormal. The parent-child process relationship seen in `Sysmon` logs indicates `conhost.exe` was spawned by `wevtutil.exe` multiple times, likely to facilitate or mask command-line operations.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There is evidence of time manipulation in the system logs where the old time was set to a value only milliseconds earlier. While not inherently malicious, when combined with log clearing, this could indicate an attempt to adjust timestamps for certain activity records.

6. **Remote Logon:**
   - The log entry shows NTLM authentication being used from a remote host (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) through `LogonType 3`, which specifies a network logon. The frequent access and high privileges obtained by the user `admin_test` prompt an investigation to confirm it aligns with known administrative practices or if it was unauthorized access.

### Assessment:
- The combination of these events, particularly the clearing of the event logs, registry modification via `reg.exe`, command execution involving log utilities, and use of high privileges, strongly suggests malicious activity on the host `Server002`.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The determined activities provide substantial evidence of log tampering, privilege misuse, and potential persistence mechanisms indicative of a compromise.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected system `Server002` from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct detailed forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise, identifying any deployed payloads or changes made beyond the current logs.
3. **Credential Check:** Investigate how `admin_test` credentials may have been compromised and review all privileged accounts.
4. **Log Review:** Further review Sysmon, Application, and Security logs for any additional indicators of compromise and confirm any other systems accessed.
5. **Preventive Measures:** Implement more stringent logging and monitoring policies, rotate all relevant credentials, and ensure multi-factor authentication is enforced on all sensitive accounts.

Continue to monitor the environment for similar activities and ensure any known vulnerabilities are patched to protect against similar attacks in the future.
"
Create a new Windows admin user via .NET,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some concerning items that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearance Event**: The presence of multiple Event ID 104 (LogFileCleared) entries (System log) indicates that logs for various services, including System and Windows PowerShell, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity is suspicious because attackers often clear logs to remove traces of their actions. The timestamps for these events are closely aligned, suggesting possible automation or a rapid manual clearing.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: In the Windows PowerShell log, we see Event ID 600 tied to an instance where PowerShell was executed using command-line instructions designed for downloading and executing a script from an external URL. The script `CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1`, hosted on a GitHub repository, was executed without proper scrutiny. Such behavior is deeply concerning as it indicates downloading and execution of potentially harmful scripts, a technique employed often by attackers to gain or maintain persistence on the system.

3. **User Creation and Privilege Escalation**: In the Security log, there are events indicating the creation of a new user, ""NewLocalUser"", followed by adding this user to the ""Administrators"" group (Event IDs 4720, 4728, and 4732). This coincides with the activities seen in the PowerShell log, suggesting the script was executed to increase user privileges or create a backdoor on the system.

4. **Network Commands Execution**: There are several Sysmon log entries indicating execution of commands like `net.exe` and `net1.exe`. These commands, especially when seen with the creation of new user accounts and adding them to administrator groups, further imply malicious intent.

5. **Automation and Timing**: The timing of these events all occur within a short span, suggesting potential use of scripts or malicious payloads executed in sequence.

### Assessment: Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the evidence above, I conclude that the logs demonstrate a clear and systematic attempt to compromise the system. The actions performed suggest an intrusion designed to gain persistent administrative access through the creation of a new admin user account.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected server from the network to prevent further spread or external communications.
- **Thorough Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the server to identify any additional indicators of compromise and understand the extent of the intrusion.
- **Review and Revoke Unauthorized Accounts**: Immediately remove any unauthorized user accounts, such as ""NewLocalUser"", and review all privileged accounts for any unauthorized access.
- **Audit and Strengthen Security Policies**: Review user activities and enforce strict monitoring of PowerShell execution policies, ensuring scripts are signed and verified before execution.
- **Routine Log Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring and regular reviews of logs to promptly detect similar activities in the future.
- **Deploy Patches and Updates**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches and fixes to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

These actions should help in both mitigating the current threat and preventing future incidents."
Create a new Windows admin user,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs thoroughly, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Detected:
1. **Command-Line Activity:**
    - A series of `wevtutil.exe` commands were executed to clear various logs such as System, Security, and PowerShell (`cl` stands for clear log). This action is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.
    - The command executed by `cmd.exe` included creating a user called `""T1136.001_Admin""` and adding it to the local `Administrators` group. This activity is indicative of unauthorized user and privilege escalation attempts.

2. **User and Group Management Events:**
    - There was a new account ""T1136.001_Admin"" created and immediately added to the Administrators group, as seen from Security Event IDs 4720 (User Account Creation), 4728 (Member added to Administrators group), and 4732 (Member added to Users group). This strongly suggests an attempt to establish persistent, privileged access.

3. **Clearing of Security Logs:**
    - The security log clearing is indicated in Event ID 1102 from the Security log, which typically indicates an attempt to eliminate records of activity that may be indicative of malicious operations.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Given the activities identified—consistent use of tools to manipulate system logs, creation of unauthorized administrator accounts, and escalation of privileges—the logs collectively suggest a concerted effort to compromise the host.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Privilege Escalation:** Creation of an unauthorized admin account and adding it to the Administrators group reflects a significant security risk as it suggests that elevated privileges were potentially obtained by an unauthorized user.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** The action of adding new admin-level users may have been intended to ensure continued access over a period.
- **Log Cleansing:** Activities intended to clear event logs point towards attempts to hide unauthorized activities post-compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Audit recently created accounts, and disable/delete any accounts that are unauthorized or suspicious.
   - Review other logs not covered by this data set to check for further suspicious activities.
   - Change passwords for all administrator accounts as a precaution.
   - Investigate the source of unauthorized user activities to identify potential security breaches.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine any network activity to detect lateral movements or connections to suspicious IPs.
   - Validate the integrity of system binaries to ensure no further tampering has occurred.
   - Monitor for further unauthorized attempts at privilege escalation or log manipulation.

Create a new Domain Account using PowerShell,"Based on the logs provided, I have observed the following details that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution for Account Creation:**
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell command execution aiming to create a user account with the name 'T1136.002_Admin' and a set password ('T1136_pass123!'). This is done by using .NET types for directory services under high integrity levels, which suggests privilege or administrative execution.
   - Such activity is often associated with malicious behavior, especially when it involves the creation of accounts or modification of credential settings.

2. **Event Log Deletions:**
   - The system and security logs are being cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Log clearing is a typical tactic employed by threat actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system.
   - The command `wevtutil cl` used several times suggests actions focused on wiping out evidence of various logs including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"" and ""Security, System, Windows PowerShell"".

3. **High Integrity Level of Commands:**
   - The commands executed are under a high integrity level, implying they are running elevated, potentially having administrative privileges. This indicates a serious security concern if unauthorized personnel are behind these activities.
   
4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `conhost.exe` is spawning repeatedly with a specific command line argument, which could be indicative of malicious actions such as command execution under the disguise of normal system processes.

5. **Anomalous Process Activities:**
   - Unusual spawning of `wevtutil.exe` processes in sequence, alongside the frequent appearance of `whoami.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and hostname checks using `hostname.exe`, usually warrants investigation. They can denote attempts to escalate privileges or establish footholds.
   
6. **Contextual Timeline Alignment:**
   - The alignment of the event timestamps with PowerShell log entries and the clearing of logs, further strengthens the suspicion that an unauthorized access or exploit is being mitigated.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on these observations:

- The execution of PowerShell scripts, especially involving account creation, is highly suggestive of unauthorized attempts to establish persistence within the host.
- The clearing of logs shortly after significant actions can indicate an effort to evade detection.
- Given these factors, the actions recorded in the logs are not typical for legitimate administrative behavior.

### Resolution:

Given the detailed analysis, the resolution of the situation, based on the provided logs, is:

- **MALICIOUS** - The activities correspond to malicious behaviors, indicating a possible compromise of the host.

Install Additional Authentication Packages,"Upon examining the provided logs, a series of concerning activities were identified and are summarized below:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Log Event ID 1102, Sysmon Events involving wevtutil.exe):**
   - The logs indicate that several event logs (Security, System, Applications, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is often associated with covering tracks after malicious activity has occurred.
   
2. **Use of Windows Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil.exe):**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is frequently observed in the logs with the intent to clear multiple event logs. This behavior indicates an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - There are PowerShell activities executing commands that manipulate the system's Local Security Authority (LSA) registry settings. Specifically, exporting registry settings and manipulating Authentication Packages for installing password filters using `AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll`. This behavior resembles privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms often utilized by attackers.

4. **Registry Manipulation via PowerShell:**
   - The registry operations to alter the LSA authentication settings, including adding new authentication packages, are suspicious and are aligned with techniques used to gain unauthorized system access or leverage persistence.

5. **Execution of sensitive applications (whoami.exe):**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` suggests an attempt to determine user context, which in the context of accompanying events could be part of a reconnaissance or privilege escalation phase.

6. **Clearing of Windows PowerShell, System, and Security Event Logs:**
   - A systematic clearing of event logs post manipulation indicates an effort to remove traces of potentially unauthorized activities and prevent forensic analysis.

**Assessment & Resolution:**
- The combination of cleared event logs, suspicious PowerShell actions for registry manipulations, and the use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs collectively form a pattern of potentially malicious behavior aimed at privilege escalation and persistence while obfuscating detection.

Given these findings, the activities observed in the logs are indicative of a compromise or impending compromise.

Azure AD - Create a new user via Azure CLI,"Upon reviewing the log entries, several activities stand out that may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs. Specifically, logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity is notable as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their actions.
   - The `EventID 1102` in the Security log confirms that audit logs were cleared, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a script execution attempting to login to Azure and create a new user using hardcoded credentials. This could suggest unauthorized attempts to manipulate cloud resources or perform actions outside of regular administrator tasks. The use of PowerShell in this manner is typical in many attack vectors, particularly in lateral movement and privilege escalation.

3. **Command and Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs, as well as `svchost.exe` process manipulations potentially related to time synchronization changes, though this can sometimes be benign depending on context.
   - Execution of legitimate system utilities like `whoami.exe` is often used to inspect system information post-compromise.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Processes executed at a high integrity level, particularly those used to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe`) and execute PowerShell scripts, can indicate privilege escalation or usage by an elevated account.

**Assessment:**
The activities observed, particularly the clearing of event logs and execution of PowerShell scripts with suspicious command lines involving credential manipulation, suggest a high likelihood of compromise or malicious intent. Combining these with the elevated integrity level of processes and repeated log clearing, as well as PowerShell usage, strongly points towards malicious motives.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Modify Terminal Services DLL Path,"Upon reviewing the collection of event logs from the Windows host, we observe several activities that stand out as potentially indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Security Event Log (EventID 1102)** and **System Event Log (EventID 104)**: These entries indicate that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks. The log entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear logs, which supports this hypothesis.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - In the **Sysmon and PowerShell logs**, there are PowerShell commands executed which attempt to modify the access control list (ACL) of `termsrv.dll`, a critical system file related to remote desktop services, and further attempt to replace it with a copy in a user's home directory under a different name `AtomicTest.dll`. Additionally, changes to the Windows registry were attempted to redirect the `ServiceDll` parameter, likely with malicious intent to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.
   - The PowerShell command modifies permissions to allow full control for administrators, a notable red flag, especially when coupled with registry modifications to what appears to be the Terminal Services settings.

3. **Time Stomping**:
   - **EventID 4616**: Logs indicate that the system time was manipulated using `svchost.exe`, probably to match the timestamps of malicious activities with legitimate activities, making detection more challenging.

These activities collectively suggest attempts to establish persistence, privilege escalation, or to cover tracks after performing unauthorized actions or modifications on the system. The combination of log clearing, PowerShell misuse, and registry manipulation strongly supports the presence of malicious intent.

### Assessment:
Given the indicators above, the resolution for this investigation is:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities depicted in the logs appear to be classic indicators of compromise. The use of PowerShell for system modification without legitimate business justification, paired with attempts to conceal these actions by clearing logs, supports this conclusion.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further potential harm or lateral movement.
   - Execute a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and any other affected systems.
   - Review access controls and audit policies to prevent similar incidents.

2. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Strengthen PowerShell usage policies and ensure logging is enabled for all PowerShell activities.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting mechanisms for critical system changes, particularly regarding event log management and registry modifications.
   - Regularly review and ensure that patching and security configurations are up to date for all systems."
IFEO Add Debugger,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several notable points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity are identified:

1. **Registry Modification via CMD**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** at `""UtcTime"":""2024-10-27 14:38:16.530""` shows a command execution using `cmd.exe` which modifies the registry key `""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\calc.exe""` to set `cmd.exe` as a debugger. This is a known technique used for persistence or to hijack the execution of applications. Such modifications are typically not normal and could indicate malicious intent unless verified as a legitimate admin action.
   
2. **Logs Cleared**:
   - **Security Log Event ID 1102** at `""SystemTime"":""2024-10-27 14:38:15.9204642""` indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

3. **Event Log Cleared**:
   - **System Log Event ID 104** at `""SystemTime"":""2024-10-27 14:38:15.7895071""` and `""2024-10-27 14:38:16.0073696""` indicates that the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared. The user `admin_test` is associated with these actions as well. This aligns with suspicious behavior as attackers often target event logs to remove traces of their activities.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Security Log Event ID 4616** and **System Log Event ID 1** show that the system time was changed. This could be a benign action related to time synchronization or could be used to manipulate timestamps in logs to confuse incident response efforts.

Based on these observations, the findings are characterized as:

- **SUSPICIOUS** due to the presence of potentially malicious indicators such as registry modifications for process hijacking, multiple event log clearances, and time manipulation. These actions collectively suggest activities attempting to avoid detection and maintain persistence in the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Investigate the `admin_test` user account**:
   - Verify if the registry modification, log clearances, and system time changes were authorized actions by this user or an indication of compromised credentials.
   
2. **Monitor and review other security tools**:
   - Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to supplement the investigation and gather broader context on the actions taken during the entire timeframe.

3. **Audit registry and system configurations**:
   - Identify any similar unauthorized registry changes across other systems and rectify them. Increase monitoring for such changes.

4. **Enhance logging and alert mechanisms**:
   - Ensure critical logs are shipped to secure central logging platforms and are not readily cleared by local users. Set up alerts for log clearance and suspicious command executions.

5. **Conduct Threat Hunting**:
   - Perform deeper threat hunting based on the applications or systems exhibiting suspicious behavior to ensure no other malicious activities have taken place undetected across the environment."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, some entries raise concerns regarding potentially suspicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Potentially Malicious Intent:**
   - The Sysmon logs record an execution of `powershell.exe` with command line arguments that modify the Windows Registry. This specific command aims to set an ""AutoRun"" entry to launch `notepad.exe` whenever the command processor is invoked.
   - **PowerShell Log Event**:
     - Commands were executed to check for a registry key at `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`, and if not present, it was created, then a new property named ""AutoRun"" was added with a value of ""notepad.exe"".
   - This type of behavior is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain presence on a system.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The System log includes events indicating that logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by `admin_test`.
   - **Security Log Event**:
     - The Security log was also cleared, as indicated by Event ID 1102.
   - Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized actions on the system.

3. **High Privileges Acquired by `admin_test`:**
   - The Security logs record multiple logon sessions (Event ID 4624 and 4672), highlighting that the user `admin_test` had gained advanced privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`.
   - While high privileges can be normal for administrative tasks, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could suggest illegitimate actions.

### Assessment:

- The sequence of `PowerShell` commands to modify the registry for persistence, coupled with log clearing events, strongly suggests an attempt to execute and conceal potentially unauthorized actions. High privileges acquired by `admin_test` further compound the risks, implying misuse of administrative capabilities.
  
### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The activities identified in the logs indicate malicious intent. The presence of registry modifications for persistence, log clearing actions, and high-level privilege actions point toward a compromise.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or exfiltration of data.
   - Initiate an internal investigation targeting any other systems the `admin_test` user account may have accessed or altered.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic investigation on the system to identify any other possible signs of malware or backdoors.
   - Capture memory, registry, and file system snapshots for detailed analysis.

3. **User and Access Management:**
   - Review and, if necessary, revoke the administrative privileges of the `admin_test` account until the investigation is complete.
   - Monitor all other privileged accounts for unusual activities.

4. **System Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Implement additional security controls such as enhanced logging, PowerShell logging, and real-time alerting on registry and file changes.
   - Consider implementing application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized script executions.

By implementing these measures, the organization can mitigate the current threat and establish stronger safeguards against future incidents."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs for any indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **Event ID 1102** and multiple **Event ID 104** entries indicate the security, system, and Windows PowerShell log files were cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. These entries are recorded by the account `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be a sign of an attacker trying to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID 4672** shows special privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges are highly sensitive and typically used by administrators or malware to perform unauthorized actions.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: The process `cmd.exe` executed a net user command to add a new user account named `T1136.001_CMD`. Creating new user accounts, especially with elevated privileges, without explicit authorization, is a strong indication of suspicious activity.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Event ID 4616** shows an unexpected change in the system time. This could potentially be used to manipulate the timestamps of events or other logs to obscure traces of malicious activities.

5. **Account Management:**
   - **Event IDs 4720, 4722, 4738, 4724, 4728, and 4732** correspond to user and group management operations performed for the account `T1136.001_CMD`, including creation, enabling, modification, and group membership changes. Such actions should be verified against known administrative tasks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, creation of unauthorized user accounts, and system time adjustments strongly suggests an attempt at unauthorized access and maintenance of control over the host.

### Assessment:

- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence within the logs points to definite malicious activities. The actions taken by the user `admin_test`, such as clearing logs, creating a new user account `T1136.001_CMD`, and privilege escalations, suggest an unauthorized and potentially harmful intervention on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the System:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activities or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Conduct a Full Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation to determine how the attacker gained access and performed these actions. Check for any other compromised accounts or systems.

3. **Review and Revoke Permissions:**
   - Review user permissions on the system and revoke any unwarranted privileges. Consider disabling or deleting suspicious user accounts like `T1136.001_CMD`.

4. **Restore from Backup:**
   - If possible, restore the system to a known clean state from backups before the malicious activities occurred.

5. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Implement additional security measures such as enhanced logging, stricter user access controls, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and regular security audits.

6. **Report the Incident:**
   - Follow your organization's incident response procedures, which may include notifying the relevant authorities or cybersecurity bodies depending on the scope and impact of the breach. 

This assessment underscores the importance of conducting continuous monitoring and having robust incident response procedures in place."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"After reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest stand out that indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Security Event Log Clearing (Event ID 1102):** The `Security` log entry reflects that the security event log has been cleared. This action was performed by user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Log clearing can be a concern as it may indicate someone trying to hide their tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Process Execution (Event ID 1):** We see process executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for multiple channels (`Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). Clearing these logs suggests that someone is attempting to cover their tracks at a wider scale, beyond just the security logs.
   - **Unusual Command Execution:** The command line executed by `cmd.exe` involves taking ownership, granting full control over `sethc.exe`, and replacing it with `cmd.exe`. This kind of activity is a known tactic to create a backdoor via the sticky keys hack, which indicates privilege escalation or persistence measures have been attempted.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - There are numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` executables running as `SYSTEM` user. While Edge updates per se are expected, the timing and quantity alongside the other suspicious activities could suggest either a misuse or stealth activity under the guise of normal updates.

Based on the above observations, the behavior captured in the event logs is consistent with malicious activity. Log clearing actions across multiple logs, alongside known privilege escalation techniques such as altering system binaries, are clear red flags.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Perform an immediate containment procedure on `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
- Conduct comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise, potential data exfiltration, or further persistence mechanisms implemented.
- Evaluate and strengthen security measures, including user account audits, permissions reviews, and enhanced monitoring for any similar activities."

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - Event ID 104 in the System log indicates that the Windows Event Log has been cleared. This activity was performed by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log shows that the security logs were cleared by the same user. Clearing of logs is often associated with an attempt to hide malicious activities and is a red flag.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon log shows a PowerShell command executing potentially malicious scripts involving Excel COM objects. This could be indicative of an attempt to load or execute potentially harmful code, related to the Atomic Red Team's TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), which are often used for simulation of real-world attacker behavior.

3. **Multiple Use of `wevtutil` Command**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times for clearing various logs (Sysmon, System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs) indicates systematic log clearing, which is unusual for regular users and is typically associated with malicious actors trying to cover their tracks.

4. **High Privilege Operations**:
   - Multiple occurrences of Event ID 4672 in the Security log indicate that accounts with certain privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) were used. This can sometimes point towards privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Atomic Red Team Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script related to Atomic Red Team's T1137.006 test was executed, which involves potentially hostile actions within Windows systems for testing defenses. While these activities can be legitimate if executed with knowledge and consent for testing purposes, if unplanned, they could also indicate unauthorized actions.

**Assessment**:
Based on the above observations, these logs contain suspicious activity, specifically the clearing of various event logs and the execution of unusual PowerShell commands indicative of potential testing or compromise activities.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**: 
- Conduct a thorough investigation to verify whether this activity was authorized or part of a legitimate security assessment.
- Analyze the system for any unauthorized changes or malware presence.

Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` running complex scripts attempting to modify registry settings and interacting with the Word application to inject VBA macros. This behavior is indicative of a potential attack pattern, often used in malware and especially associated with techniques like ""Living off the Land"" (LotL) attacks.

2. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script:**
   - The PowerShell script tries to alter Word's security settings (`AccessVBOM`), potentially to enable macros that could automate malicious tasks within Microsoft Word documents.
   - It also attempts to create scheduled tasks using PowerShell, which are aimed at executing the calculator application (`calc.exe`). Such technique is sometimes used for persistence by attackers.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple logs indicate that security and system logs were cleared (`EventID 1102` for security and `EventID 104` for system and PowerShell). Clearing logs is a significant red flag in forensic analysis, as it indicates a potential attempt to erase traces of malicious activity.

4. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is noted. The usage of this command in conjunction with high-integrity-level processes and clearing logs suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These are utilities used for identifying the context of operations (username, hostname). The use of such commands, especially following PowerShell activities, could indicate reconnaissance activities by an attacker.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- The combination of registry modifications via PowerShell, VBA macro injection attempts, and log clearing are strong indicators of a sophisticated attack or compromise. These activities could potentially be part of an effort to execute and conceal malware.
  
- The PowerShell script incorporates detailed commands to modify registry settings and create macros that schedule tasks, indicating a likely intent to establish persistence and potentially execute malware at a scheduled time.

**Assessment:**

Based on the detailed analysis:
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Assessment:** Strong indications suggest an active attack or compromise.

Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities have raised significant concerns regarding potential malicious activity.

### Analysis

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System and Security Log Clearing:** The logs indicate that multiple logs have been cleared, specifically the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs (EventID 1102 and EventID 104), just moments before or during suspicious activity. Log clearing is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Command:**
   - **PowerShell Execution (EventID 600):** A PowerShell script was executed with a command designed to manipulate the `termsrv.dll` file. This file is related to Terminal Services, and the script attempted to back up and alter permissions, copy, and modify this DLL file, which likely aims to alter remote desktop service behavior, potentially a move towards implementing backdoor access.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **EventID 4616 in Security Logs / EventID 1 in System Logs:** There is an adjustment in system time logs, which appears deliberate to potentially confuse timestamps in logs and mislead forensic analysis.

4. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - **High Privileges Granted (EventID 4672):** The account `admin_test` was granted significant privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege among others. This could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain persistent elevated access.

5. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The same user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is consistently performing actions with high integrity levels, pointing towards a single malicious source or compromised account.

### Conclusion

Given the patterns and behaviors observed, particularly the combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell command execution, alteration of critical system files (termsrv.dll), time manipulation attempts, and privilege escalation, these logs represent deliberate actions that are typically associated with an attack or unauthorized activity.

Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided logs, several events stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity. Here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:  
   - **System Log Event ID 104 & Security Log Event ID 1102**: The logs indicate that the event logs for ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is often associated with attempts to cover up tracks after an intrusion or unauthorized access.
   - **Sysmon Logs**: The occurrence of the ""wevtutil"" command in multiple Sysmon logs to clear logs (from `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, and `Security`) is found. The execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands is particularly suspicious as this command-line utility is designed for clearing event logs.

2. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - Several PowerShell script executions (`Event ID 600` in Windows PowerShell logs) involve modifying registry entries related to the Local Security Authority (LSA) (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`) to add a potentially malicious password filter DLL (`AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll`). This behavior aligns with malicious techniques used for credential harvesting or persistence.

3. **Use of Atomic Red Team Techniques**:
   - The PowerShell logs mention importing and setting configurations similar to known Atomic Red Team techniques, specifically related to password filters (`T1556.002`). Atomic Red Team is a framework used for emulation of adversarial techniques and can indicate malicious simulation activities if not in a controlled, authorized environment.

4. **Suspicious Process Creation**:
   - Multiple instances of suspicious process creation and execution involving `Powershell.exe`, `reg.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are logged. While there are Microsoft-related updates and Edge services (EdgeUpdate.exe) visible, the significant concern arises from the utility of PowerShell and registry modifications, as they heavily suggest unauthorized activities which could prevent administrative or security controls.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
These logs present significant hallmarks of potentially malicious activity:
- Log events being cleared intentionally.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts with code to tamper with security-relevant registry keys.
- Utilization of known adversary simulation frameworks for potentially unauthorized activities.

**Resolution**:
- Based on the detailed examination and due consideration of the potential risks, the activity in these logs can be confidently categorized as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Investigate the Extent of Compromise**: 
   - Begin a thorough forensic analysis of Server002 to trace back the access point and identify the extent of the breach.
2. **Isolate the System**: 
   - Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent potential spread or further damage.
3. **Restore from Backup**: 
   - If feasible, restore the server from a known good backup before the suspicious activity occurred.
4. **Incident Report and Communication**: 
   - Document the incident comprehensively and communicate with the Incident Response team to manage the event effectively and prevent recurrence.
5. **Increased Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Monitor further logins and log clearings, deploying additional controls where possible to alert on similar activities in the future.
6. **Update Security Policies**:
   - Revisit and secure accounts with heightened privileges and ensure robust security policies and practices are enforced.

By proceeding with caution and adhering to incident response protocols, the organization can mitigate risk and prevent potential breaches of a similar nature."
Application Shim Installation,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of event ID 104 under the System channel indicate log clearing activities for the System and Windows PowerShell logs by the user `admin_test`.
   - Similar activity was recorded in the Security channel with event ID 1102. This indicates the clearing of the Security logs, also by `admin_test`.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several Sysmon log entries reveal the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (command `cl` used for clearing) for different channels (`Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`).
   - The clearing of logs is a common tactic to hide malicious activities after a compromise.

3. **Command Line Execution:**
   - Notably, the following command was observed: 
     ```
     cmd.exe /c sdbinst.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1546.011\bin\AtomicShimx86.sdb""
     ```
   - This command indicates the use of `sdbinst.exe` to install a shim database, typically used for compatibility but can be exploited for persistence and privilege escalation by attackers. The path contains references to ""AtomicRedTeam"", which is known for simulating threats, although the presence of audit tools doesn't necessarily imply an attack if used for testing purposes.

4. **Abnormal Use of PowerShell and Conhost:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` close to each other might indicate an attempt to interact with the system shell.
   - Given the associated timestamps and the user context, these operations may be part of an automated script, either regular administrative maintenance or part of a sophisticated attack sequence.

5. **Application Installations/Updates:**
   - A series of events pertain to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process. While this in itself can be normal (auto-updates by Microsoft Edge), in conjunction with other suspicious behavior, it could be leveraged by adversaries as a cover for malicious activity.

### Assessment

- **Log Clearing:** The clearing of multiple logs by the same user (`admin_test`) in a short period of time is very suspicious behavior, often indicating malicious activity trying to avoid detection.
  
- **Process Execution and Persistence Techniques:** Executing a command to install an `sdb` file in a peculiar context raises an alarm, especially since it references a known adversary emulation project, ""Atomic Red Team"".

- **Administrative Context:** All these activities are being performed under a high-integrity level user (`admin_test`), indicating misuse of administrative privileges.

### Resolution

Given the analysis, the activity detected in the logs should be considered as:
- **MALICIOUS** - The sequence of events suggests an intentional effort to alter system logs to erase any trace of actions, installation of shim databases with potentially suspicious use, and use of administrative commands in a manner typical of compromise and persistence methodology.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Response:** Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
- **Thorough Investigation and Forensics:** Collect forensic artifacts from `Server002` for deep analysis (memory dump, file hash checks, additional logs).
- **Review User Accounts:** Evaluate the activities and validity of the `admin_test` account.
- **Incident Response Planning:** Engage the incident response team to trace and eliminate any foothold the threat actors might have.
- **Patch and Secure:** Immediately patch any vulnerabilities found during the analysis and reinforce auditing and logging mechanisms to detect such patterns in the future.

It is crucial to monitor for similar behaviors across other systems in the network to ensure the threat has not propagated."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"Analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals several patterns and specific events that suggest potential malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **Security Log Clearance:** Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared by a user account `admin_test`. This action is often an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks following malicious activity.
   - **System and PowerShell Log Clearance:** Event IDs 104 in the System log show that `admin_test` also cleared the System and PowerShell logs. Clearing multiple logs at such close intervals is highly suspicious and indicative of potential nefarious activities being covered up.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Event IDs 4616 and 1 in System log:** There is evidence of system time being altered. This type of activity can be used to backdate activities or confuse logging systems.

3. **Use of High-Privilege Account:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** The account `admin_test` was granted various high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often indicative of privilege escalation attempts or lateral movement.

4. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - **Execution of PowerShell with Administrative Credentials:** The PowerShell log shows execution of a script that used administrative credentials. The specific script attempted to start `calc.exe` using CIM sessions, which suggests a possible attempt to execute arbitrary or unexpected code with elevated permissions.

5. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple `Sysmon` logs show `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear different logs. This tool is commonly used to programmatically manage event logs, including clearing them, and its usage here corresponds with the log clearances noted elsewhere.
   
6. **Command Execution Pattern:**
   - **Execution of `whoami`, `hostname`, and similar utilities:** Frequent execution of these utilities could be part of a reconnaissance phase, allowing an actor to gather information about the compromised environment.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of the logs, there are clear indicators of potential compromise. The actions taken by the user `admin_test`, such as log clearance and execution of potentially dangerous scripts with high privileges, align with tactics commonly employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks and perform unauthorized actions within a system.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine whether unauthorized changes were made to the system or other systems in the network.
   - Review all logins and actions taken by `admin_test` to verify legitimacy.

2. **Account and Access Review:**
   - Immediately review and update the access permissions for `admin_test` and any other accounts with administrative privileges.
   - Enforce stricter policies on the usage of administrative accounts, possibly implementing multi-factor authentication.

3. **System Restoration and Monitoring:**
   - Consider restoring the system to a state prior to the log clearances and suspicious activities.
   - Increase monitoring and logging to detect and investigate any further suspicious activities promptly.

4. **Audit and Security Measures:**
   - Conduct a security audit of the network and all connected systems.
   - Implement enhanced security measures to prevent a recurrence of unauthorized log clearance and privilege escalation."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key points stand out as indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon log, event ID 17988 shows ""powershell.exe"" is used with a command involving `Copy-Item` and registry modification commands. This is specifically indicative of a potential persistence method by modifying registry keys (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDlls`). The presence of `AtomicTest.dll` suggests this might be related to a simulation or a test, possibly leveraging Atomic Red Team, a known framework for testing security controls.
   - Command Line Executed: `""powershell.exe"" & {Copy-Item ...etc}` shows attempts to copy a DLL file into a public directory and modifying the Windows registry for persistence. This can be considered malicious, especially the registry line indicating a potential persistence mechanism.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - Another Sysmon entry (Event ID 17990) captures ""reg.exe"" was used to add a registry key under `AppCertDlls`, which aligns with the actions from the previously mentioned PowerShell command. This direct registry modification supports the hypothesis of persistence attempts or malicious configuration changes.

3. **Security and System Event Log Clearing**:
   - Logs indicate the security (Event ID: 1102) and system logs (Event ID: 104) were cleared, likely by ""admin_test"". This is a common tactic used to hide tracks post-compromise, which is strongly indicative of malicious activity.

4. **Suspicious File Copying**:
   - The PowerShell log shows command lines executed that are consistent with attempts to copy files and modify registry keys. The atomic test name in the DLL indicates possible testing but used improperly could imply breach simulation exercises or actual malicious activity.

5. **General Context**:
   - All actions appear to be executed under the user context ""SERVER002\admin_test"", aligning with a single user which could mean compromised credentials or improper usage by an insider.

### Assessment
Given the evidence of a credentialed account executing potentially harmful commands through PowerShell and registry modification activities, combined with actions to clear event logs, the behavior is highly concerning and strongly indicative of unauthorized or potentially malicious activity. 

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The combination of registry modifications for persistence, use of PowerShell for potentially harmful actions, and log clearing activities point to deliberate steps taken to ensure persistence and evade detection, suggesting a high probability of a malicious act.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker.
  - Change credentials for ""admin_test"" and investigate any anomalous use of this account.
  
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Verify if ""AtomicTest.dll"" is part of a legitimate security testing suite being run intentionally by your team or an unauthorized action.
  - Review firewall, intrusion detection systems, data, and network activity logs for other signs of compromise.
  
- **Remediation**:
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach.
  - Remove any unauthorized registry entries, and revoke any abnormal modifications.
  
- **Post-Incident**:
  - Enhance monitoring for elevated PowerShell activity and registry modifications.
  - Evaluate your security controls against similar Atomic Red Team techniques to ensure resilience against similar exploitation attempts in the future."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that indicate potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple log files were cleared almost simultaneously by the user ""admin_test"" on the computer ""Server002"". The logs specifically cleared are from the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and hinder forensic analysis.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log reveals execution of a complex script that involves WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) persistence with the intent to execute the command ""notepad.exe"" through the creation of event filters and consumers under the namespace `root\subscription`. This pattern matches the behavior of known attack techniques for persistence and is indicative of malicious intentions or testing of such techniques.

3. **Use of Sysmon for Event Logs Access**:
   - The processes `wevtutil.exe` are being repeatedly used to clear logs as shown in the Sysmon logs. This, in conjunction with log clearing events, strongly indicates an attempt to hide unauthorized actions.

4. **High Privilege Operations**:
   - Event ID 4672 in our logs shows special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM user, which is not unusual but paired with the above activity could suggest privilege misuse.

The combination of the above behaviors suggests an elevated threat level. While the execution of Windows updates and normal administrative processes is typically benign, the combination of log clearing, suspicious use of PowerShell scripts that mimic known adversarial persistence techniques, and unauthorized clearing of event logs paints a picture of potentially malicious activity.

Given these observations, the resolution is:
- **MALICIOUS** - The presence of script that mimics adversary persistence tactics, coupled with activities that attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs, indicates the logs most likely capture malicious behavior.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately initiate an endpoint detection and response mechanism to further inspect the affected systems for anomalies.
- Review access controls and permission settings, especially for the potentially compromised user account ""admin_test"".
- Conduct a full scan and investigation for any other compromised vectors or backdoors.
- Evaluate for deployment of additional logging and monitoring solutions that can detect unauthorized log clearance and PowerShell misuse.
- Consider notifying legal and compliance teams as per your organization’s incident response procedures."
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **PowerShell Log**:
   - The events indicate the execution of a PowerShell script copying files labeled as ""AtomicRedTeam."" This is known to be an open-source tool used for testing security detection and is associated with techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework (specifically T1546.011 - Event Triggered Execution: Application Shimming).
   - The appearance of the ""AtomicRedTeam"" within the environment could indicate a benign test or training scenario, but also has the potential to indicate simulation of attacks.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - There are multiple process executions, notably `wevtutil.exe` clearing event logs for `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs. This is highly suspicious and aligns with typical behavior of an adversary attempting to cover their tracks.
   - The command `wevtutil.exe cl` was run multiple times, which stands out as unusual. Clearing event logs, especially Security logs, is a key indicator of an attempt to obfuscate actions.

3. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 1102 shows the Security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This confirms the action seen in the Sysmon logs and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

4. **System Log**:
   - Similar to the Security log, events indicate that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. The process IDs are linked back to `wevtutil.exe` commands found in the Sysmon logs.

5. **Application Log**:
   - There's no specific anomalous activity evident, apart from the timestamp. No direct connections to suspicious processes were found here aside from regular logging events.

### Assessment:
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: The clearing of logs is particularly alarming and likely indicates an attempt to delete footprints left by unauthorized activities or tests. The presence of ""AtomicRedTeam"" could suggest either a security test that was not appropriately communicated or potentially malicious intent.
- **Guidance**:
  - Confirm with the security or IT teams whether this was an authorized test.
  - If not authorized, this indicates strong potential for unauthorized system access.
  - Recommend initiating a broader investigation and monitoring for unusual activity.
  - Verify the integrity of the system and ensure data is not being exfiltrated.

### Conclusion:
Given the indicators observed, notably the event log clearance and the context of AtomicRedTeam usage without confirmed authorization, these logs point to **SUSPICIOUS** activity. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the true intent behind these actions."
Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several events that stand out and require further discussion regarding suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` provider indicates log file clearing activities with Event ID 104, suggesting this might have been intentional to hide actions or evade detection:
     - `admin_test` cleared system, Windows PowerShell, and security logs at ""2024-10-27 13:19:23"". Clearing event logs is a common tactic to cover malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modification**:
   - A command using `reg.exe` was executed to modify the Windows registry:
     - The command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v ClxDllPath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f` is noted. This can represent a persistence mechanism or defense evasion, and the usage of `cmd.exe` to modify registry keys abruptly stands out.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - Time was changed on the system twice consecutively within a second, shown by Event ID 4616 in the security log indicating time adjustments. While not overtly malicious on its own, it's an uncommon operation that can be exploited for altering time-sensitive logs, especially if it corresponds to other suspicious activity.

4. **System Utility Executions**:
   - There are multiple commands being executed by presumably the same user or a service, including:
     - Execution of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. Such executions could be parts of legitimate administrative tasks but can also have contexts in preliminary reconnaissance tasks by an attacker.

5. **Miscellaneous Activities**:
   - Host activity includes several legitimate updates and operations like Microsoft Edge Update, which aligns with typical maintenance actions but should be separated from the suspicious activities.

### Assessment:

Detecting malicious behavior in event logs typically hinges on reviewing abnormalities or sequences of events that deviate from typical administrative tasks. In this case, certain actions raise suspicion due to:

- Clearing event logs by a single user.
- Registry modifications without an administrator’s context.
- Time manipulation indicating potential means to obfuscate timestamps.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the absence of more direct indicators of compromise but substantial evidence of potentially malicious actions, the activities noted warrant further investigation. Additional steps should include:

- Verifying the legitimacy and necessity of the log clearing activities.
- Reviewing access permissions and any new accounts or altered accounts associated with `admin_test`.
- Monitoring network traffic from `Server002` for any anomaly.
- Investigating system integrity, especially around the file paths and registry keys mentioned.
- Cross-verifying if there are established changes in company protocol regarding registry key updates or log management policies around the date of events. 

These actions help ensure the system integrity and security posture of `Server002` while elucidating any illegitimate tampering."
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings have been observed:

1. **Log Cleared Events**: 
   - In the Security logs, we see `EventID 1102` which indicates that the event logs were cleared. This is a potential sign of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to hide their actions.
   - Additionally, corresponding Sysmon entries indicate `wevtutil.exe` was used for clearing logs across different channels (Security, Application, Windows PowerShell, etc.) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to download a file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1197/T1197.md` using `Start-BitsTransfer`. This behavior could be part of a simulation/testing tool (as Atomic Red Team provides testing frameworks for various attack tactics), but it can also indicate potential malicious behavior if unauthorized.
   - The usage of PowerShell to download scripts from the internet without prior authorization should generally raise suspicion.

3. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - Excessive use of high-integrity-level processes and the same user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) performing actions like clearing logs and running potential download scripts is suspicious, especially if this behavior is not typical for this user or context.
   - High integrity processes often indicate attempts at privilege escalation or unauthorized actions performed by a potential adversary.

4. **Frequent Invocation of Microsoft Edge Update and Other System Executables**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update, including various child processes and system processes (like `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, etc.) being executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While legitimate processes can spawn such activities, unusual frequency or context of these processes (unexpected times, unusual version or paths) may indicate attempts to blend malicious processes with legitimate software operations.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of evidence where logs are cleared right before or after suspicious file transfers and system processes, especially with such administration-level access, increases the suspicion of potential malicious activities.
- The fact that PowerShell is being used to download scripts from a public URL and the associated log clearing actions highly suggest the presence of unauthorized or potentially harmful activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a full investigation into the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`, including a review of recent activities, changes in privileges, and any unauthorized use.
- Isolate the system to prevent potential spread until a thorough check can be performed.
- Analyze downloaded scripts and any subsequent actions they may have taken.
- Ensure that anti-virus/endpoint protection is functioning and up to date.
- Check recent permission changes or account creations that were not authorized.
- Implement stricter logging and alerting mechanisms to detect such activities in the future.
- Train staff on recognizing signs of potential compromise and the importance of maintaining logging integrity."
Install AppInit Shim,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The security (EventID 1102), system, and PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" right before or concurrently with other repetitive and suspicious activities. This is often considered a significant red flag as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks. Event clearing without a known and legitimate reason should be scrutinized.

2. **Excessive Use of Wevtutil for Log Clearing:**
   - A series of `wevtutil` commands were executed by ""admin_test"" to clear multiple logs (“Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational”, “Application”, “Security”, and “Windows PowerShell”). This tool clears event logs, and its use outside of administrative tasks, especially in quick succession and during times of unrelated user activity, can indicate malicious intent.

3. **Registry Modification with Cmd.exe:**
   - An instance of cmd.exe running a command to import a registry file located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1546.010\src\T1546.010.reg` points to a potential execution of Atomic Red Team scripts. These scripts are used to test security setups by simulating adversary techniques—potentially indicating pen-testing or malicious activity.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indications:**
   - EventID 4672 shows a logon with special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This can indicate activities typical of privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - There is an initial process of `powershell.exe` executed by ""admin_test"". While not inherently suspicious by itself, in conjunction with other activities, it raises concern.

6. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Frequent launches of system utilities and processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others under administrative privilege in quick succession could indicate scripting execution or a security test.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of:
- Log clearing activities immediately following potentially malicious actions.
- Use of PowerShell and system utilities in a manner consistent with testing or attack patterns.
- Registry changes aligned with suspicious paths known in offensive security contexts.

The activities in these logs present significant anomalies indicative of potential unauthorized actions, likely aligned with post-exploitation or penetration testing activities.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The patterns observed are consistent with activities typically associated with unauthorized access or adversarial behavior.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate the Source of Activities:** Conduct a full investigation of the user account ""admin_test"", check recent changes, remote access logs, and review for unauthorized access.
2. **Isolate System:** Consider isolating the system for in-depth forensic analysis.
3. **Review Log Access Controls:** Ensure strict access controls and monitoring of event logs to prevent unauthorized clearing or manipulation.
4. **Implement Real-Time Monitoring:** Employ tools that alert on the execution of utilities like PowerShell or `wevtutil` under high integrity levels or with suspicious command lines.
5. **Check for Presence of Unauthorized Tools:** Validate if any unauthorized software is present on the system by inspecting file systems and registry logs more thoroughly.

Taking these steps will help mitigate existing threats and prevent future similar scenarios."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon a detailed review of the provided Windows event logs from the PowerShell, Security, Application, System, and Sysmon logs, here is the condition analysis and findings:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - All the PowerShell logs show an execution of a script that manipulates Excel properties and copies files under the guise of manipulating Excel Add-ins. This activity is associated with the `AtomicRedTeam` project, specifically T1137.006, which simulates adversary behavior.
    - The commands manipulate Office add-in settings to add an Excel Add-in if conditions based on the version of Excel (32-bit vs 64-bit). The use of file paths and PowerShell scripting for such tasks aligns with common tactics used in penetration testing exercises and attack simulations but could also be misused by malicious actors.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - There are multiple instances within the Security, System, and Sysmon logs (Event ID 1102 in Security log and Event ID 104 in System log) indicating that a user `admin_test` cleared the event logs across multiple channels (Security, System, Windows PowerShell).
    - Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity, often done to cover tracks by deleting evidence of potentially malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
    - There are several traces of the use of `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is often used to clear event logs. The process was initiated by `admin_test`, corresponding with the Security and System clear logs.
    - Legitimate processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` appear, but given the context of the evasion technique (clearing logs), these processes might have been running concurrently or as a decoy during suspicious activities.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
    - There are multiple legitimate-looking Microsoft Edge and Windows components activities, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which align with regular system maintenance tasks concerning updates.

### Conclusion:

- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - The PowerShell scripts reference Atomic Red Team tactics, indicative of a test or exercise but potentially could indicate attempted exploitation if not authorized.
  - The event log clearing through `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system user is highly suspicious, as this command is typically used to cover tracks.

- **Risk and Threat Evaluation**:
  - Clearing of logs is typically suspicious behavior and could indicate a significant security incident, especially when executed by a regular user account and not a system process.
  - If not part of a controlled test, this indicates a compromise as an attempt to evade detection.

### Resolution:

Given the combination of unauthorized log clearing and the scripting activity involving Excel COM objects from non-standard locations, the overall findings lean towards:

- **MALICIOUS** - Indicators strongly suggest potentially unauthorized or malicious activity, especially due to the event log clearing, which is a tactic used by malware and malicious insiders to prevent detection.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Security Review**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account activities, verify user actions, and ensure they are part of legitimate IT or security procedures.
2. **Containment**: If this activity was not authorized, isolate the affected system to prevent further potential unauthorized access.
3. **Audit and Monitoring**: Increase logging around suspicious operations, especially those clearing or modifying logs. Tools or systems performing these actions should be verified for legitimacy.
4. **Review and Validate any Pen-Testing Exercises**: If this is part of a legitimate test, ensure documentation and authorization are in accordance with company policies.

It is critical to verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts associated with AtomicRedTeam and validate whether the event clearing was sanctioned or is genuinely an indication of malicious activity."
Create a new account similar to ANONYMOUS LOGON,"The analysis of the provided logs reveals a significant presence of suspicious activity that suggests potential malicious behavior. Here are the notable findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: The security logs have been cleared by `admin_test`. This is often a significant indicator of malicious activity as it could be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **System Log (Event ID 104)**: The system and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by `admin_test`. This adds to the suspicion, reinforcing the possibility of an attempt to erase evidence.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Log**: Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` with the intent to clear logs from various channels are evident:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - This activity usually indicates an attempt to remove traces of actions that could indicate a compromise.
   
3. **User Account Creation**:
   - **Sysmon Log Events**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a user ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" with the password ""T1136_pass123!"" stands out as highly suspicious and indicative of unauthorized account creation.

4. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The usage of legitimate Windows binaries like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others are normal, but when combined with the log clearing and account creation, they build a narrative of exploiting the system.

5. **Time Synchronization**:
   - There are entries for time synchronization, which alone may not be suspicious but when combined with other activities, can indicate coordination in changing timestamps.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The combination of cleared logs, unauthorized user creation, and the use of `wevtutil` indicates the system may have been compromised with possible malicious intentions. 

Based on the collective evidence from the logs, the resolution is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Response**: Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or propagation of any potential threat.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify how the intruder gained access, considering checking for vulnerabilities or backdoors.
- **Review User Credentials**: Change passwords and review user account permissions, especially for `admin_test` and newly created accounts.
- **Security Posture Review**: Implement stronger policies for log retention and monitoring. Consider additional security controls such as multi-factor authentication and network intrusion detection systems.
- **Report Incident**: Follow organizational protocols to report this incident to the relevant security authorities within the company.

By following these steps, the organization can manage the immediate threat and bolster its defenses against future attacks."
Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows logs, I've identified several key points that prompt suspicion regarding potentially malicious activity.

### Summary of Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **Security Log Cleared (Event ID 1102):** The security log was cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This action is suspicious as clearing logs can be an attempt to cover unauthorized or malicious activity.
   - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared (Event ID 104):** The system logs and PowerShell logs have also been cleared. This aligns with attempts to hide traces of malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672):** The user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for malicious purposes like manipulating processes.

3. **Potential Malicious Command Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Command (Event ID 600):** There is a recorded PowerShell activity where the command `Install-TransportAgent` was used to install a transport agent related to Microsoft Exchange. This might indicate exploitation against email systems or unauthorized changes in the email transport path.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` processes are observed, which were executed by the `admin_test` user to clear event logs. This supports the hypothesis of log tampering.

5. **Multiple Processes and System Commands:**
   - **Usage of System Utilities Observe**: The execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and extensive use of `conhost.exe` which might be used during reconnaissance or to execute further commands.
   
### Assessment of Threats and Risks:

Given these log entries, the following risks and threats are identified:

- **Indicator of Compromise:** The event log clearance and assignment of high-privilege rights suggest possible unauthorized access and system manipulation.
- **Potential Insider Threat:** The actions performed by the `admin_test` user may indicate an insider threat or the compromise of an administrative account.
- **Data Breach or Service Compromise Risk:** Attempts to modify the transport agents in Microsoft Exchange could lead to data interception or service disruptions.


### Proposed Resolution and Next Steps:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is highly suggestive of suspicious behavior, possibly malicious, and warrants further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Incident Response Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Host:** Consider isolating the system from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - **Password Reset:** Reset credentials for the `admin_test` user account and any other accounts with similar activity patterns.

"Persist, Download, & Execute","## Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain events indicate activities that could potentially be malicious or used in a suspicious manner.

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Multiple log clearing events are recorded where the ""admin_test"" user cleared logs (EventID 1102 and EventID 104). 
   - Clearing application and security logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after making unauthorized changes.
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which is an unusual and suspicious activity if conducted by a non-legitimate administrative process.

2. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - Time discrepancies are noted with EventID 4616 showing the system time being changed, possibly to manipulate timestamps of events to cover or alter timelines of malicious activity.

3. **BITS Administration Utility Usage:**
   - The execution of `bitsadmin.exe` to download a file from a GitHub URL related to Atomic Red Team (ART) (known for testing defense mechanisms) could be an indication of an attack simulation or malicious download attempt.
   - Use of BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) is often exploited by malware to download malicious payloads discretely.

5. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - Invocation of `cmd.exe` initiating `bitsadmin.exe` with command arguments that download files and execute other processes (like Notepad) is indicative of a possible command/control activity.
  
6. **Presence of PowerShell Command Clearing Logs:**
   - Even though the PowerShell log entry is not present, the clearing of PowerShell logs using `wevtutil.exe` points towards a meticulous attempt to erase traces possibly generated by PowerShell scripts or commands.

### Assessment of Situation:
The combination of log clearing activities, system time manipulation, and suspicious BITS activity, together with `cmd.exe` commands that interface with well-known exploitation toolkits, suggests a significant indication of malicious behavior or at the very least suspicious actions that could be part of an intrusion or post-intrusion phase in the system lifecycle.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential Cover-up Actions:** Log files are being cleared systematically which may suggest unauthorized or at least questionable activities were conducted under the ""admin_test"" user profile.
- **Suspicious Network Activity:** Downloading a file from an external source using BITS could potentially introduce malware into the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** If feasible, isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **In-depth Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the extent and impact of activities, investigate the source and intent of the downloaded file.
3. **Credential Examination:** Examine and reset credentials for the ""admin_test"" user account to prevent any unauthorized access.
4. **Monitoring & Alerts:** Enhance monitoring on this system and similar configurations across the network for suspicious behavior patterns, such as process execution anomalies and system time changes.
5. **Patch & Harden:** Ensure all security patches are applied and systems are hardened following best practices to reduce vulnerabilities.

### Final Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of anomalies involving log manipulations, suspicious command downloads, execution patterns, and time alterations convincingly point towards malicious activity. These activities are classic signs of intrusion tactics aimed at data collection, operational security subversion, and potential future exploitation phases or active stages of an attack lifecycle."
Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a series of indicators point towards potentially malicious activity or at least suspicious behavior that requires further investigation. Here are the critical observations:

### 1. **Use of PowerShell and MOF Files:**
The logs show the execution of a PowerShell command that involves the `mofcomp.exe` executing a Managed Object Format (MOF) file located in a temporary directory linked to the ""AtomicRedTeam"" framework:
- **CommandLine:** `powershell.exe & {c:\\windows\\system32\\wbem\\mofcomp.exe \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1546.003\\src\\T1546.003.mof\""}`
- The usage of MOF files in conjunction with PowerShell scripts can be indicative of attempts to modify WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) objects, which is a known technique for persistence.

### 2. **Event Log Cleared:**
Multiple event log clearing events were detected, indicating potentially a cover-up attempt:
- **Security Log (EventID 1102):** Cleared by `admin_test`
- **System Log (EventID 104):** Cleared by `admin_test`

Clearing logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide malicious actions on the system.

### 3. **Unexpected Utilization of `wevtutil.exe`:**
The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) is concerning:
- The sequence of `wevtutil.exe` events indicates system logs are being cleared (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, and `System`).
- Consistently run by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### 4. **Potential Malicious Script Deployment:**
- The execution pattern of processes such as `svchost.exe` in unusual contexts, and the presence of an executable in a temporary directory (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in `Microsoft\\Temp`) are unusual and suggest potential code or script execution from unauthorized directories.

### 5. **Unusual User Activity:**
- Activities carried out under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, including clearing logs, executing utilities with elevated privileges, and deploying scripts, denote suspicious behavior.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given these findings and correlations, it is prudent to categorize the logs under the **SUSPICIOUS** resolution. This categorization is based on:
- Potential abuse of administrative tools (`PowerShell`, `wevtutil`) for malicious intent.
- Attempts to obscure activities by clearing event logs.
- Execution of suspicious scripts potentially modifying WMI settings via PowerShell and `mofcomp.exe`.

### Recommendations:

- **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` and any potentially unauthorized access or actions associated with it.
- **Containment:** Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise.
- **Log Recovery:** Attempt to recover the cleared logs if backups exist or utilize forensic recovery techniques.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Increase monitoring of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe` usage, and log clearance events. Establish alerts for similar activities.
- **Patch Management:** Ensure systems are up to date against the known exploitation vectors and techniques used in the identified risks.

These actions will help assess the threat level accurately and potentially uncover malicious actors or actions within the network."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Below are the key points of analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell logs show a script that creates a Word.Application COM object. It checks if the application path contains ""Program Files (x86)"" to determine if the system is using a 64-bit or 32-bit Office version. It then copies files from a path associated with Atomic Red Team, a known security testing framework, into the Word Startup directory. After copying, it stops and restarts the WinWord process.
    - This type of script could be part of a legitimate security testing exercise, often used by Red Teams or threat simulation tools. However, it can also be indicative of a malicious attempt to persist a payload within Microsoft Word's startup directory.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
    - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs show instances of event log clearing by a user named ""admin_test"". The following command was used: `wevtutil.exe cl`. Clearing logs is a common tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks, making this activity suspicious.

3. **Sysmon Observations**: 
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are logged, which corresponds to the clearing of event logs. This action is directly linked to the suspicious log clearing activity seen in the System log.
    - Numerous instances of the Edge Update COM Registration Helper (MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe) under the account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` were seen. While EdgeUpdate activity under SYSTEM authority can be normal in certain update settings, its frequency here, alongside the PowerShell activities and log clearing, adds to the suspicion.

4. **Security Log**:
    - The Security log confirms that the event log channel ""Security"" was cleared, which is heavily indicative of attempts to hide activities, possibly malicious.

5. **Application Log**:
    - An entry from `edgeupdate` mentions ""Service stopped,"" which ties with the rest of the Edge Update activities. While Edge updates are generally benign, in this context, they are unusual paired with the other suspicious activities noted.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Indicators**:
  - PowerShell script performing file operations in potentially sensitive directories.
  - Event log clearance activities detected for System, PowerShell, and Security logs.
  - The presence of repeated EdgeUpdate-related activities.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities captured in these logs clearly indicate suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. While the presence of Atomic Red Team artifacts suggests the possibility of authorized testing, it is crucial to verify whether these activities were sanctioned and ensure no unauthorized misuse or malicious intent is involved. I recommend:

1. Confirming whether the PowerShell activities align with authorized Red Team tests or threat simulations.
2. Reviewing access logs and confirming user ""admin_test"" authenticity and permissions.
3. Conducting a threat hunt on the system to detect any malicious dropped payloads or other indicators not covered by this analysis.
4. Strengthening monitoring and alerting on critical log clearance commands and unusual PowerShell use.

Continued vigilance and follow-up investigation are imperative to ensure the system's integrity and security."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log Clearance:** Event ID 104 from the System log indicates that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is captured twice in rapid succession. Log clearance, especially in such a short timeframe and without a legitimate and documented intent, is a common tactic used by attackers to cover traces of nefarious activities.
   - **Security Log Clearance:** Event ID 1102 from the Security log shows that the ""Security"" log was cleared. This activity is also associated with the user ""admin_test"". Clearing the Security log is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity as it is a critical log that can stop certain illegal activities from being detected.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (the Windows Event Utility) being executed, with command-line instructions showing attempts to clear Sysmon, Application, and Security event logs. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is indicative of foul play, particularly when combined with the log clearance events. 
   - **XSUSER `xcopy.exe`:** A command executed by `cmd.exe` uses `xcopy.exe` to copy files from a temporary directory (`T1505.003\\src`) to `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot`. This action is potentially linked to the Atomic Red Team test (referenced by `T1505.003`) known for simulating adversarial techniques and might point towards a web shell installation or another means of maintaining persistence.

3. **Unusual Logging Patterns:**
   - **Repeated edgeupdate Activity:** Multiple entries are observed related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While this might be normal, the frequency and the concatenation with log clearing events could suggest extensive and potentially unauthorized updates or installations.

**Assessment:**

The sequence of events described above markedly suggests suspicious activities. The combination of log clearing, frequent use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, and possibly anomalous file copying into a directory typically earmarked for web content (particularly if referring to `inetpub\\wwwroot`) lends reason to suspect malicious intent.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities — such as log clearing and evidence of possible suspicious file copy actions — which don't outright confirm malicious behavior but definitely warrant further investigation. More context and a deeper look into intent, user interviews, and potential connections to production services (possibly compromised) may be crucial steps forward.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Containment:** Initiate containment protocols to isolate the affected system until a more detailed investigation can effectively determine the integrity of the host.
   - **Preservation of Evidence:** Ensure no further log clearing can occur. If possible, back up current log data to a secure location.

2. **Investigation:**
   - **Audit User Activity:** Investigate the activities of `admin_test` to determine legitimacy.
   - **Review Permissions and Changes:** Look into any changes in access permissions or configurations around `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot`.
   - **Detect Network Anomalies:** Check for unusual outbound connections originating from Server002 that may indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized access.

3. **Remediation and Monitoring:**
   - **Increase Monitoring:** Heighten log review and implement additional security monitoring measures for further suspicious activity regarding Server002.
   - **User Education:** Engage in user education focused on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity, particularly in admin accounts.

Due to the suspicious nature of the log entries, further investigation is necessary to confirm the full scope and impact of the potential threat."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several notable activities and occurrences that suggest potential malicious activities and warrant a thorough investigation. Here's my detailed analysis:

### Application Log:
1. **Sysmon Crashes**: Multiple entries indicate that `Sysmon.exe`, a system monitoring tool often used for security purposes, experienced application crashes (Events 1000, 1001). The crashes coincide with error code `c0000005`, which suggests an access violation. This may either be an indicator of an intentional attack on security monitoring software or an unstable system configuration. 

### System Log:
1. **Log Clearing Activity**: The system log records that logs for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" were cleared by the user `admin_test` at around the same time. This is generally concerning as log clearing can be indicative of an attacker trying to hide their tracks or an unauthorized admin action.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **WMI Persistence Setup**: The logs demonstrate an advanced persistence technique using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) Event Subscription. This includes creating a WMI event consumer to execute a VBScript running `notepad.exe`. The script is suspiciously linked to a known adversarial simulation framework `Atomic Red Team`, which is commonly used for penetration testing and Red Team assessments. Such actions are potentially malign, especially if no legitimate testing activities were scheduled.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Activity**: The `wevtutil.exe` process is used to clear the Sysmon/Operational log channel, as observed in the Sysmon log entries. This action aligns closely to the System log clearing by `wevtutil.exe`, indicating an attempt to manipulate logs potentially to disguise other activities.
2. **PowerShell Execution and Logging Clearing**: Additional entries that led to PowerShell execution are associated with scripted tasks related to the `AtomicRedTeam-WMIPersistence-ActiveScriptEventConsumer` indicating sustained WMI activity.

### Security Log:
1. **Security Log Clearing (Event 1102)**: The security logs were cleared shortly after the suspicious events occurred. This is a significant indicator of potentially malicious intent, as clearing security logs typically represents an attempt to erase traces of unauthorized actions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the presence of suspicious activities such as Sysmon crashes, unauthorized log-clearing, advanced persistence mechanisms (WMI event subscription), and a direct association with known malicious frameworks, the evidence in the logs points to potential malicious activity. The use of known Red Team techniques without corresponding explicit authorization points toward an unauthorized intrusion or insider threat scenario.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The patterns observed in the logs exhibit characteristics of malicious attempts to establish persistence, obfuscate activities by clearing logs, and potentially exploit system monitoring tools. Immediate response actions, including containment, further forensic analysis, and notification of appropriate security teams, are recommended to address the threat and secure the system environment.

### Recommendations:
1. **Isolate the Affected Host**: To prevent further compromise.
2. **Conduct a Comprehensive Forensic Investigation**: To understand the full scope of the intrusion.
3. **Increase Monitoring and Logging**: Implement additional logging to capture detailed user activities.
4. **Review and Bolster Security Policies**: Assess the use of administrative tools and permissions.
5. **Evaluate All Software and Scripts**: Ensure legitimate usage or remove unauthorized tools/scripts."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious behavior:

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are logged, associated with `admin_test`, specifically the command to clear logs like `Security`, `Sysmon`, `Application`, and `System`. This sequence of commands indicates a deliberate attempt to cover tracks, given the direct association with log clearance:
     - Process IDs: `6892`, `5484`, `1500`, and `6364`.
     - These executions have integrity levels marked as ""High"", denoting administrator-level privileges.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command logs attempts to run commands that involve copying and starting Excel processes by executing a script from the `AtomicRedTeam` toolset (mimics known attacker behavior):
     - `CommandLine`: `""powershell.exe"" & {Copy \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1137.006\\bin\\Addins\\ExcelVBAaddin.xlam\"" \""$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Excel\\XLSTART\\notepad.xlam\"" , Start-Process \""Excel\""}`
   - The `PowerShell` logs also show an error indicating a failed execution: ""Could not find a part of the path"", implying incomplete or unsuccessful command execution.

4. **Potential Use of Threat Emulation Tools:**
   - The mention of ""AtomicRedTeam""—a known threat emulation technology—suggests intentional actions to simulate or execute attack vectors.

5. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Entries in the `System` and `Application` logs confirm clearance actions, further indicating attempts to erase historical evidence of activities conducted on the system.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis of the behaviors laid out above, the event logs strongly indicate likely attempts by a user (`admin_test`) to conduct actions that suggest malicious or unauthorized testing activities. The execution of PowerShell commands related to `AtomicRedTeam`, combined with log clearing activities and frequent use of potentially malicious command lines, is typical of adversarial behaviors intending to abuse functionalities or test defenses.

**Final Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of `Server002` to determine the root cause and extent of potential compromise.
- Review and secure any administrative credentials associated with `admin_test`.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for similar activities.

Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several activities warrant closer examination, pointing towards potentially malicious behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events are noted, with commands embedded to modify the PowerShell profile to start Calculator (`calc.exe`) every time PowerShell is opened. This behavior is unusual and suggests persistence or adhoc exploitation using compromised profiles:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Add-Content $profile -Value \""\""
     Add-Content $profile -Value \""Start-Process calc.exe\""
     powershell -Command exit}
     ```
   - These entries occurred a few seconds apart, repeatedly indicating this setup might be automated or scripted.

2. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The Security event log reflects the clearing of log entries (EventID 1102) by the user `admin_test`. This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - Similarly, the System log indicates clearing the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs:
     ```
     LogFileCleared with SubjectUserName: admin_test
     ```

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear various event logs (Sysmon EventID 1). This further supports the activity to obfuscate actions on the system and indicates potential tampering.

4. **Unusual Logon Events:**
   - Continuous elevated privileges and multiple impersonations of SYSTEM accounts logged (EventID 4672), which could indicate privilege escalation methods.
   
5. **Processes Accessed:**
   - The spawning of numerous legitimate Windows processes like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `calc.exe` through PowerShell scripts, using seemingly benign tools in a script or manual sequence which is typical in post-exploitation phases.

### Conclusion:

There is a notable pattern indicative of potentially malicious behavior due to persistence mechanisms, clearing logs, and unusual execution of processes using PowerShell scripts. The presence and manipulation of high-integrity PowerShell sessions further point to privilege misuse or exploitation attempt.

  - Conducting a thorough investigation of the changes made to user profiles especially focusing on the profiles adjusted by `admin_test`.
  - Reviewing user `admin_test` activities and cross-referencing with legitimate tasks to identify anomalies.
  - Initiating steps to secure accounts and elevate monitoring, focusing on PowerShell execution and log modification actions.
  - Restoring system aspects from prior secure backups before these actions initiated (before mentioned timestamps).
  - Considering revoking/removing administrative rights for the involved user until this issue is resolved.

This situation requires further investigation into how these actions were initiated, whether through a breach or an internal misconfiguration/misuse."
Create a new user in PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new local user with the name ""T1136.001_PowerShell"" without a password. This event aligns with a known MITRE ATT&CK technique (T1136.001: Create Account: Local Account), which involves account creation for persistence.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". The clearing of event logs (Event ID 1102 in Security and Event ID 104 in System logs) might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **User Account Manipulation**:
   - Logs indicate the creation and enabling of a new user account (""T1136.001_PowerShell""), with the respective SIDs, and modifications to user account properties.

4. **Use of Elevated Privileges**:
   - The ""admin_test"" account has several high-level privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.), which were likely used to clear event logs and create/manipulate the user account.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell with command lines indicative of account creation.
   - The frequent use of ""wevtutil"" (event utility tool) by ""admin_test"" aligns with the clearing of event logs.

Based on these observations, the evidence points towards malicious activity:

- The creation of a user account without a password is rarely legitimate and often seen in exploitation scenarios.
- Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of attempted cover-up.
- The execution patterns involving the manipulation of user accounts with high-level privileges and event log clearing suggest actions taken outside of normal administrative tasks.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately review and disable/remove the newly created user account ""T1136.001_PowerShell"".
- Conduct a full incident response operation on ""Server002"", including root cause analysis, to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Assess whether the ""admin_test"" account was compromised or used legitimately.
- Increase monitoring and review historical logs for similar patterns of behavior across other systems.
- Implement stricter policies and monitoring for PowerShell usage and user account modifications."

Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided log entries, a few suspicious patterns emerge that may indicate potential malicious activity. Let’s examine these observations in detail:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security, System, and PowerShell):**
   - **EventID 1102 (Security Log Cleared) and 104 (System and PowerShell Log Cleared):** The `admin_test` user is observed clearing event logs in quick succession. This is highly suspicious behavior, often associated with attempts to obfuscate action traces in an environment. Event logs are typically essential for forensic investigation, and their clearing can be indicative of malicious intent.

2. **Time Travel/Manipulation:**
   - The alteration of system time is noted as svchost.exe adjusts the system clock backward. This manipulation can be a tactic for evading detection by confusing the timestamp-based security events. This unusual activity is captured by EventID 24 and 1 in the System log. 

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **EventID 1 (Sysmon):** The execution of `cmd.exe` with complex arguments manipulating the registry is captured. The use of `cmd.exe` to change registry settings, particularly related to Office security, along with directory creation and file alterations in an Application Data directory (`%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Outlook\\VbaProject.OTM`), indicates potential unauthorized access or configuration adjustments for persistence or exploitation.

4. **Processes with Elevated Privileges:**
   - Multiple legitimate Windows processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`) are executed within a high Integrity Level context by the `admin_test` user. While these executables are legitimate, context and timing of execution (particularly with registry changes and log clearing) are suspicious.

### Assessment:

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - The logs demonstrate clear indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior including event log clearing, time manipulation, and registry alteration. These activities align with common tactics used by threat actors to obfuscate their presence and facilitate further exploitation or persistent access.

- **Guidance on Proceeding:**
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the `Server002` host. Key actions should include retrieving any available backup logs, examining the system and application integrity for further chicanery, evaluating network logs for lateral movement, and scrutinizing the `admin_test` account for abnormal access patterns or credential compromise.
  - Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and detection mechanisms for privileged user activities, particularly around event log access and modifications.
  - Ensure systems are patched and endpoint security solutions are updated to detect known vulnerabilities and exploits.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The event logs contain activities that strongly indicate a malicious compromise. Immediate investigation and corrective action are recommended to ensure the integrity and security of the host environment."
Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities appear to indicate suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing and Wevtutil Commands:**
   - Multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil.exe` process are noted in the Sysmon logs, which are used to clear event logs. Specifically, commands like `wevtutil cl System`, `wevtutil cl Application`, `wevtutil cl Security`, and `wevtutil cl ""Windows PowerShell""` were executed. This pattern is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs.
   - Corresponding System log entries with Event ID 104, showing logs being cleared by the user `admin_test`, and a Security log entry with Event ID 1102 support the suspicion of deliberate log clearing.

2. **Unusual Command Line Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show `cmd.exe` being executed with a complex command-line argument that involves taking ownership of `osk.exe`, modifying its permissions, deleting it, and creating a symbolic link to `cmd.exe`. The use of `takeown` and `icacls` suggests privilege escalation attempts or file manipulation potentially indicative of a backdoor installation.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are Kernel-General and Security logs indicating that the system time was altered. Unauthorized time changes can be used to confuse time stamps or facilitate certain attacks that rely on timing.

4. **Process Execution Traces:**
   - The executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are generally benign but could be part of reconnaissance activities. The context in which these commands were executed, following log clearing, makes them part of the larger suspicious puzzle.

5. **NTLM Authentication:**
   - Security log entries indicating a successful NTLM login session for the `admin_test` account from a machine named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` might warrant further investigation to verify whether this login was legitimate, particularly as it coincides with periods where suspicious activity was recorded.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Activity Characterization:** The logs showcase clear signs of atypical and potentially malicious behavior. The log clearing commands are a fundamental indicator of someone attempting to hide their tracks, and the command line for `cmd.exe` strongly implies unauthorized activity or exploitation techniques being employed.

Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - **System Log, Event ID 104** and **Security Log, Event ID 1102** indicate that logs were cleared on `2024-10-27`. The clearing of event logs without proper justification is often suspect as it can be an attempt to hide evidence of unauthorized activity. The user `admin_test` cleared both the System and Windows PowerShell logs, which warrants further investigation.
   
2. **Command Execution with Potential Malware**:
   - **Sysmon Log, Event ID 1 (PID 5888)** shows `cmd.exe` executing a series of registry modifications under the `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test` key. These modifications set `TerminateOnDesktopSwitch`, and `StartEXE` changes to launch `cmd.exe`, followed by executing `atbroker /start malware_test`. This sequence resembles tactics to establish persistence on the host using an assistive technology (AT) hijacking method, which is indicative of malicious activity.
   
3. **Process Execution Contexts**:
   - Multiple execution contexts involve interaction with critical Windows components like `wsmprovhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These interactions aren't suspicious per se, but conjunction with the log-clearing activities, they suggest an attempt to manipulate or assess the environment possibly by a threat actor.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - **Security Log, Event ID 4616** suggests minor time adjustments were made, which is typically authorized and not directly suspicious. However, it is worth noting in conjunction with other potentially malicious activity as log-timestamp manipulation is a common tactic.

5. **Use of an Administrative Account**:
   - The `admin_test` account was used for these operations. Verification is needed to determine if this account's behavior aligns with typical administrative actions or whether it has been misused.

**Assessment**:
- **Threat/Risk Identified**: Potential tampering with logs and establishing persistence through registry manipulation indicate a possible compromise.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  1. **Isolate** the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement or further compromise.
  2. **Conduct a forensic investigation**: Retrieve additional logs, check for unauthorized access activity, and verify the integrity of key system files.
  3. **Review account activity**: Specifically, analyze the `admin_test` account for unauthorized use, changes in permissions, or unusual login times.
  4. **Clean-up and Remediation**: Remove any unauthorized registry entries, assess if `cmd.exe` or `atbroker.exe` hijacking has been removed, and ensure no persistence mechanisms are in place.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity indicative of malicious behavior, including potential log obfuscation attempts and system persistence mechanisms. Immediate action is required to mitigate the risk."
COM hijacking via TreatAs,"From the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key observations:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:** The logs show PowerShell script execution that interacts with the registry at a detailed level. Specifically, the script involves adding registry entries related to ""AtomicTest"" using CLSID manipulation and links to a GitHub URL for a scriptlet file. The use of ""rundll32.exe"" to execute code is also evident. This pattern is indicative of a known technique (T1546.015) for executing code using scriptlets, often associated with red team activities or potential attacks. The connection to a GitHub URL hosting the scriptlet file could suggest a download and execute scenario, raising concerns about the code being executed.

2. **Event Log Clearing Activities:** The logs indicate that the event logs ('System', 'Windows PowerShell', and 'Security') were cleared shortly before or after the execution of the above PowerShell scripts. The clearing of event logs can be an indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activity.

3. **Unusual Process Execution Patterns:** Sysmon logs show numerous executions of ""reg.exe"" with command lines that correlate to the registry changes identified in the PowerShell logs. This includes commands that might be part of a larger script, which was likely executed by ""powershell.exe"".

4. **Privileged Activity:** The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" executed the event clearing and other processes with high integrity levels. The activities appear to be executed with administrative privileges, indicating either insider threat activities or a compromised administrative account being used for these operations.

Based on the above observations, the behavior captured in these logs points to a potentially malicious operation that aligns with recognized attack techniques. These involve:
- Execution of potentially malicious scripts via PowerShell.
- Manipulation of the registry in atypical ways.
- Attempts to obfuscate or hide the activities by clearing logs.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities or data exfiltration.

2. **In-Depth Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any additional compromised hosts or accounts. Consider using forensic tools to analyze the host's disk image and memory.

3. **Review and Reset Credentials:** Review and reset credentials, especially for privileged accounts (""admin_test"") that may have been compromised.

4. **Restore and Secure:** Plan for a thorough restoration of the affected system from a known good state or backup. Ensure the latest security patches are applied, and endpoint protection solutions are in place.

5. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring and detection mechanisms for signs of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the future. This includes robust logging and alerting on event log clearing activities and PowerShell script execution.

6. **Incident Report:** Prepare a detailed incident report summarizing findings, actions taken, and recommendations to prevent future occurrences."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"### Detailed Analysis

After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate potentially suspicious activities:

#### System Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 104**: The clearing of event logs is a red flag, especially when done without prior notice or a routine schedule. Logs for both the System Channel and Windows PowerShell Channel were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
  
#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **wevtutil.exe Events**: There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" (clear) command across various channels, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The clearing of logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
  
- **cmd.exe with Technical Indicator**: The command-line activity of `cmd.exe` includes a modification to the registry to set the debugger for Windows Error Reporting to `notepad.exe`. This action mimics a known attack technique where attackers hijack applications or processes for persistence or to bypass defenses.

#### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 1102**: Indicates the security log was cleared. This is another significant red flag, suggesting attempts to remove traces of changes or activities in the system by the user `admin_test`.

### Assessment of the Situation
The combination of logs being cleared (System, PowerShell, and Security) and registry changes aligns with known malicious behaviors often seen in post-exploitation phases of an attack, such as removing evidence of actions taken and setting up persistence mechanisms.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Privilege Misuse**: The user `admin_test` may have administrative privileges and is involved in potentially malicious activities. If this user account is compromised, it poses a significant risk.
- **Log Tampering**: The clearing of logs across different channels indicates a deliberate attempt to remove evidence of activities.
- **Registry Tampering**: Modifying registry settings to point debugging to notepad.exe could indicate attempts to intercept or alter normal processes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a detailed audit of the `admin_test` account to determine if it has been compromised or misused.
2. **Account Management**: Temporarily restrict or monitor the access of `admin_test` while the investigation is ongoing.
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Re-enable auditing and ensure that log forwarding to a secure, remote location is configured to prevent tampering.
4. **Check for Persistence**: Investigate further into the registry changes and any unauthorized tasks or scheduled items.
5. **Network Analysis**: Conduct network traffic analysis to detect any suspicious communications or lateral movements from this host.

### Final Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity detected is malicious, with clear indicators of compromise, including log clearing and registry manipulation, attempting to evade detection and establish persistence.

This assessment indicates potential security threats, and immediate measures should be taken to mitigate any further risk to the organization."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities that require further analysis.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - In the Security and System logs, there are several events (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log) indicating that log files were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This action is often performed to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Abnormal Privilege Use**:
   - Multiple occurrences of Event ID 4672 indicate the use of special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). This is a potential indicator of privilege escalation, particularly if these actions were not expected or authorized for the user `admin_test`.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell script execution (`powershell.exe & {...}`) involving the creation of a COM object and execution of `cmd.exe` to run `calc.exe`. This kind of activity is typical of an attempt to exploit system vulnerabilities or execute unauthorized commands through PowerShell. 

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The Security log shows Event IDs 4616, indicating that the system time was changed. Although not inherently malicious, unauthorized changes to the system time can be an evasion technique used by attackers.

5. **Command Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, suggesting log manipulations, as this tool is commonly used for such purposes.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, although legitimate commands, are frequently used in recon phases of an attack to gather information about the system and the user's privileges.

### Assessment:

The combination of cleared event logs, use of special privileges, suspicious PowerShell activities, and time adjustments strongly suggests malicious activity. These activities can be part of sophisticated tactics often used by attackers to hide their tracks, escalate privileges, and run unauthorized commands on the system.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Action Plan**:
  1. Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential damage.
  2. Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the isolated system to determine the full scope of the compromise.
  3. Reset the credentials of `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
  4. Review and possibly restrict the privileges assigned to users, especially around the execution of PowerShell scripts and system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
  5. Reinforce logging policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing and detect similar activities in the future.

Given the potential for an active compromise, immediate action should be taken to safeguard the network and identify other potentially affected systems."
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided logs, several suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

### Key Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
    - In the **System log**, there are events indicating that logs in several channels, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security, were cleared by the user `admin_test` (EventID 104 and Security EventID 1102). Such actions of log clearing are often associated with attempts to cover tracks of malicious activities.

2. **Windows Sysmon Logs**:
    - A number of process creations involving `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility (used for handling Windows event logs) were recorded, which include commands to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). The consistent pattern of this utility running suggests potential tampering or clearance of logs, which is further corroborated by the log clearing activities.

3. **PowerShell Scripts**:
    - The **Windows PowerShell log** and its corresponding Sysmon logs indicate execution of a script related to Atomic Red Team tests (`AtomicRedTeamT1546.011`). These tests are known for simulating adversarial tactics, potentially indicating either testing activity or a possible attempt to mimic attack patterns.
    - The command in PowerShell log involves setting new registry properties, hinting at a possible persistence mechanism or other system modifications.

4. **Security Implications**:
   - Security log includes a successful NTLM logon event for `admin_test` with elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeSecurityPrivilege`, which could facilitate malicious actions or cover-up operations.

5. **Time Tweaks**:
    - Several logs from the **Security log** and **System log** indicate time changes involving `svchost.exe`, which might point toward system time manipulations that could be used to alter timestamps of actions for evasive purposes.

### Assessment:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed the clearing of event logs, execution of PowerShell scripts for modifying registry settings, possible misuse of Windows utilities like `wevtutil`, and potential time modifications, strongly indicate malicious behavior. These actions are typically aimed at achieving persistence, hiding the attacker’s tracks, and maintaining access.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further suspicious activities or lateral movement.
   - Collect and securely store forensic artifacts and snapshots for an in-depth analysis and evidence preservation.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of any user activities linked to `admin_test` and investigate any unauthorized access attempts.
   - Examine system integrity, especially registry changes and any unauthorized installed software or services.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Reset all credentials associated with sensitive accounts, especially those used in the affected systems.
   - Establish more rigorous monitoring and alerting mechanisms for critical event logs and PowerShell activity.

4. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement tighter access controls and least privilege principles to sensitive accounts.
   - Ensure systems are patched and up to date, along with security configurations.

Given the observed logs, these recommendations will help in addressing and mitigating possible threats observed from these logs."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators stand out which suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log File Cleared Events**: Multiple events (Event ID 104 for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels, and Event ID 1102 for the ""Security"" channel) indicate that log files were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is commonly associated with malicious actors attempting to hide their tracks after performing unauthorized actions, as log clearing can hinder forensic investigations.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Activity**: A Sysmon event (Event ID 1) shows the execution of the command `cmd.exe /c net user ""T1136.002_Admin"" ""T1136_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""T1136.002_Admin"" /add /domain`. This command is used to create a new user and add them to the ""Domain Admins"" group, which is indicative of privilege escalation efforts. This is a significant red flag in security monitoring, as unauthorized creation and promotion of a user account to administrative levels is a textbook sign of compromise.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**: The logs show several processes running at a high integrity level, associated with the ""admin_test"" user and involving command line tools (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`) that can be used for administrative tasks, including clearing logs. While high integrity processes themselves can be normal, in the context of other suspicious activities, they warrant closer scrutiny.

4. **Process Execution Patterns**: There are multiple Sysmon events (Event ID 1) where legitimate Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `net.exe` are executed. Although these are legitimate binaries, their execution in this context, especially after log clearing, suggests their potential use in a ""Living off the Land"" scenario, where legitimate tools are used for malicious purposes to avoid detection.

5. **Unusual Network Connectivity**: Logon activity through NTLM on a system-level account with a workstation name (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) and an IPv6 address that appears unusual might suggest potential unauthorized remote access.

6. **Time Discrepancies**: The Kernel-General and Security log events suggest time manipulation, which can be used to evade logging mechanisms tied to specific timestamps.

Based on these observations, the log data suggests a possible breach that involves:

- Attempted privilege escalation through unauthorized user creation within a domain.
- Potential log tampering or clearing to hide activity.
- Indicators of lateral movement or credential harvesting via network logons.

Given the evidence, my assessment categorizes this as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate actions should include:

- Conduct a thorough investigation to confirm the unauthorized changes and identify the extent of compromise.
- Isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
- Review and reinforce access controls and logging mechanisms.
- Consider user activity monitoring and endpoint detection solutions for enhanced security.

This assessment is based on the current log events and should be verified with further investigation and correlation with additional data sources if available."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"Based on the logs provided, there are several activities that warrant a closer look due to their potentially suspicious nature:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell command executed to modify the Windows registry key `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` with an `AutoRun` string set to `notepad.exe`. This is often indicative of an attempt to persist a script or executable to start automatically with command prompt sessions, which is a common persistence mechanism used by attackers.

2. **Log Clearing**: The logs indicate that the security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. The EventID 1102 from the Security log shows that the 'admin_test' user cleared the logs. Log clearing can be an indicator of an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**: The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the logs on the system logs for various channels (Sysmon, Application, System) by the `admin_test` account is suspicious, especially when combined with the other activities.

4. **Time Manipulation**: There are events recorded indicating a time change on the system. While this can occur during regular maintenance or updates, it could also be used by attackers to tamper with timestamps for forensic analysis. The time was changed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which can occur legitimately under certain circumstances, but is notable when combined with other suspicious activities.

5. **High Integrity Level Process Executions**: Various processes were executed with high integrity levels, which is typical for administrative tasks but should be evaluated in context. The string of executions involving PowerShell, use of `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` might suggest execution with elevated privileges, usually not a part of routine administrative actions in quick succession.

6. **Edge Update Activity**: Multiple Edge Update-related activities were initiated, but they appear to be standard process executions and do not directly raise alarm on their own. However, they coincide with other more suspicious log events.

### Conclusion:
The combination of the registry change, log file clearing, suspicious chain of process executions related to `wevtutil.exe`, and time manipulation suggests a pattern that is consistent with potential malicious activities aimed at maintaining persistence, subverting logging, and covering tracks.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

#### Recommended Actions:
- Perform a detailed investigation on the `admin_test` account’s activities and access controls.
- Review the modifications made to the registry and consider reverting unauthorized changes.
- Conduct a security audit on the system and evaluate any recent changes or anomalies.
- If necessary, isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
- Consider resetting time settings to correct values if not authorized changes.
- Increase monitoring on PowerShell and other high-risk activities with appropriate alerting thresholds."
Change Default File Association,"### Analysis

Upon analysis of the provided logs, several key observations and patterns emerge that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is indicated by the Event IDs `1102` and `104`. Clearing event logs is a commonly employed technique by attackers to cover their tracks, and typically raises a red flag.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) with command lines like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security` indicates the clearing of specific logs. These operations were all executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` at high integrity levels. This behavior supports the suspicion of log-clearing activities.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `assoc .hta=txtfile` suggests an attempt to manipulate file associations, possibly to hijack `.hta` files or to prevent them being executed as HTML Applications and instead open as text, which could be an obfuscation tactic.

3. **Unusual User Activity:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` were noted. While this command is used to display the current user, frequent invocation can indicate enumeration activities on the part of an attacker to validate access levels or permissions.

4. **Integrity Context:**
   - The commands were executed at a high integrity level indicating the user had elevated privileges. This along with the log-clearing commands strengthen the case for malicious intent.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous events related to Microsoft Edge updates, which in isolation would not be suspicious; however, in combination with the other behaviors observed, any unusual patterns should warrant closer inspection to ensure no leverage or exploitation of the Edge Update service occurred.

### Conclusion

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** 

The logs depict a sequence of suspicious activities which primarily involve clearing critical event logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`) and tampering with file associations. These behaviors are characteristic of actions taken by an attacker after executing unauthorized or malicious operations to impede forensic investigations by obliterating traces of their presence. The observed patterns are alarming, warranting the classification of the activities as malicious.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Initiate a thorough investigation into all actions taken by `SERVER002\admin_test` around the time of the event logs.
   - Ensure all user accounts with elevated privileges are audited and if necessary, adjust their permissions to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   
2. **Incident Documentation:**
   - Compile a full incident report detailing all findings, collected evidence, and timelines.
   
3. **Forensic Review:**
   - Obtain a memory dump and a current state snapshot of `Server002` for further forensic analysis.
   - Review installed software and running services for anomalies or malware presence.
   
4. **System Protection:**
   - Consider restoring the system to a known good state if signs of compromise are confirmed.
   - Regularly review audit and security logs and configure alerts for critical security events like log clearances.

5. **Awareness & Training:**
   - Educate administrative users about the importance of log integrity and best practices in preventing and responding to security incidents."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"Based on the provided log entries, here's a detailed analysis of the potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple log entries indicate that critical logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Specifically, these events have Event IDs 104 and 1102, which denote the clearing of logs. This action is a typical behavior that attackers perform to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was actively used in clearing logs, which is seen in the Sysmon logs. Clearing event logs without a legitimate reason is usually considered suspicious, especially when performed by an account with administrative privileges like `admin_test`.

3. **Potential Registry Manipulation**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to add a registry key related to Microsoft Outlook's WebView using `reg.exe`. The registry modification was directed to a file located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1137.004\src\T1137.004.html`. This is suspicious because it involves changing registry keys related to Outlook, which can be exploited for persistence or to manipulate application behavior.

4. **Execution of Known Administrative Tools**:
   - Tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed frequently. While not inherently suspicious, the context (log clearing) and accompanying registry changes suggest they could be part of a larger malicious operation.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that most actions are performed with high integrity level and by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This suggests a high privilege level, which is often necessary for executing sensitive operations like modifying the registry or clearing logs.

**Risk Assessment**:
- The activity of clearing crucial logs, the use of administrative command-line tools (especially `wevtutil.exe` for log management), and unauthorized registry manipulation are consistent with behaviors associated with malicious intent.

**Recommendations**:
1. Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized access or compromise.
2. Review recent changes to critical systems and applications for unauthorized modifications.
3. Restore and analyze any backup logs if available to discern what activities occurred before the logs were cleared.
4. Monitor and alert on the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, especially when used to clear logs.
5. Conduct a broader security assessment to identify and mitigate any further vulnerabilities or threats.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**"
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and suspicious activities have been noted:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances (`EventID 104`) of logs from the System and Windows PowerShell channels being cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a potential indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after executing unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - A PowerShell command (`EventID 600 in Windows PowerShell log and EventID 1 in Sysmon log`) is being executed with a suspicious sequence that includes manipulating the registry. The script modifies the registry paths for `whoami.exe` and sets ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe"" as a monitored process. These actions are typically indicative of a technique to persistently run benign applications (like `calc.exe`) as a way to obfuscate malicious activities.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Processes:**
   - The activities involving `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other processes are executed with high integrity and are linked to the `admin_test` account. The clearing of logs and execution of such tasks with elevated permissions is particularly concerning.

4. **Behavioral Indicators:**
   - There are repeated executions of system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) which appear excessive or redundant in the context, often used as a way to stage or execute further malicious actions under the guise of normal utilities.

5. **Potential Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The command-line action involves accessing Image File Execution Options (IFEO) and SilentProcessExit settings in the registry, which can be utilized for process debugging or persistence tactics by advanced threats.

Based on these elements, the behavior recorded in the logs appears to be more than typical benign or misconfigured operations. The evidence strongly suggests activities aligned with potential obfuscation and unauthorized high-privilege operations.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Isolation:** The host `Server002` should be isolated from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **Detailed Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to verify any additional compromised accounts, malware persistence mechanisms, or additional malicious modifications.
- **Audit and Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on sensitive accounts and enable detailed auditing of PowerShell and registry activities across the network.
- **Security Awareness:** Reinforce security training and awareness for users, emphasizing safe practices and the importance of reporting suspicious activities."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"After thoroughly reviewing the provided event logs, here is the analysis of potential suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Event Records**: 1091 to 1098 from Windows PowerShell log entries.
   - **Details**: 
     - A PowerShell script is executing commands indicating potential exploitation or testing purposes: usage of `New-Object -COMObject ""Word.Application""`, checking if the application path contains ""Program Files (x86)"", writing to the registry in office-related paths, stopping and starting `WinWord` processes.
     - The script seems related to ""Atomic Red Team"", which is a known set of adversary emulation techniques used for testing security controls.
   - **Assessment**: The use of Atomic Red Team's path indicates potential security testing rather than an active threat. However, unauthorized usage of simulation tools can suggest a misuse or malicious activity if not sanctioned or monitored.

2. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - **Event Records**: Sysmon logs show multiple `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear logs) activities for several channels: ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - **Details**: 
     - Various `wevtutil.exe` processes initiated by an `admin_test` account, with a high integrity level, were used to clear logs almost simultaneously.
     - The act of clearing event logs is a well-known tactic by adversaries to cover tracks.
   - **Assessment**: This activity significantly raises suspicion. Clearing logs without a solid administrative purpose is typically considered malicious when found in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity.

3. **Account and Logon Activity**:
   - Appears consistent with a high-privilege user (`admin_test`) executing a series of operations locally on Server002.
   - Consistent use of elevated privileges (high integrity level) might be normal for administrative work but adds risk when combined with log clearance and PowerShell execution.

4. **System Processes**:
   - Various system processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `wermgr.exe` were legitimate system processes that do not raise explicit suspicion by themselves.

### Conclusion

Considering the use of PowerShell to potentially deploy a testing script, especially under the context of Atomic Red Team, combined with the clearing of event logs utilizing `wevtutil.exe` under elevated privileges without clear justification, the activity is assessed as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Guidance

- **Investigation**: Immediate investigation is required to confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell script execution—ensure it was sanctioned as part of a penetration test or security control evaluation.
- **User Verification**: Validate the actions of the `admin_test` account – check if the user had authorization for executing these tasks.
- **Log Reviews**: Review any available backup logs if possible to understand the extent and sequence of actions before the clearance.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Implement monitoring and alerts for event log clearance and suspicious PowerShell activities, to prevent misuse or detect malicious activities earlier.
- **Incident Response**: If unauthorized, this should trigger incident response processes to ascertain any further compromise or data exfiltration risks."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**  
   - In both the Security and System logs, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002."" This event is a critical security indicator, as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks and can be associated with malicious activity or unauthorized access.

2. **Tool Execution:**  
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" (clear) command to clear various Windows event logs, including the Security, System, and Application logs. This activity is consistent with attempts to delete logs, which typically occur when an attacker wants to hide evidence of their actions.
   
3. **Process Execution and Command Line Analysis:**  
   - Several processes were executed with administrative privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`) by the user ""admin_test,"" including repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs. Also, the execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to install a module using `appcmd.exe` raises suspicion as it could indicate tampering or unauthorized installations.
   
4. **Use of Windows Built-in Tools:**  
   - The presence and execution of `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` in conjunction with clear commands further underscores suspicious behavior. These tools are legitimate Windows utilities often exploited by attackers to execute commands and manage processes clandestinely.

5. **Anomalous User Behavior:**  
   - The user ""admin_test"" is involved in actions that are not typical for routine administrative tasks, such as clearing multiple logs simultaneously and executing potentially suspicious command lines. The behavior observed deviates from standard operational procedures.

**Assessment:**  
The evidence strongly suggests the presence of malicious activity. The simultaneous clearing of multiple critical logs, combined with the execution of high-integrity processes using built-in Windows tools, indicates an attempt to cover tracks and possible unauthorized administrative access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate `Server002` to prevent potential further malicious activities or lateral movement within the network.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to understand the extent of the penetration, including memory dumps and disk analysis.
  - Review account activities for ""admin_test"" and other administrative accounts to detect any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  - Reset relevant user credentials, especially privileged accounts, to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Long-term Considerations:**
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting strategies for log clearing events and usage of built-in utilities like `wevtutil` and `cmd.exe`.
  - Educate and train administrative users on secure operational practices to identify and prevent misuse of legitimate Windows tools.
  - Evaluate and enhance access control policies, ensuring principle of least privilege is enforced throughout the network."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, there are several points worth highlighting as part of this analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Event ID 1102 in Security log and Event ID 104 in System log:** Both event types indicate that log files (Security and System channels) have been cleared. These types of events are suspicious, especially when initiated by a user account like `admin_test`, as they can indicate attempts to hide malicious activity. The log clearing involved executing `wevtutil` commands to clear logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to erase their tracks after carrying out malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Logs and Sysmon Event ID 1:** The PowerShell scripts executed involved modifications to the ""Image File Execution Options"" (IFEO) registry keys for debug purposes, setting various accessibility tools (e.g., sethc.exe) to launch `cmd.exe` upon activation. This registry modification is frequently used for privilege escalation or persistence by attackers, as it can allow an unauthorized user to obtain command line access with system-level permissions.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** This event shows that an account with `SYSTEM` privileges was granted special privileges. While this could be normal, given the context of the other suspicious activities (logon with privileges immediately following log clearing), this should be further examined. 

4. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - **Application log entries for SecurityCenter:** These entries indicate that Windows Defender is on, which implies that real-time protection is active on the system. However, the effectiveness of the protection or whether it has detected any threats should be investigated further outside of these logs.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Kernel-General Events (Event ID 1):** These display small changes in time set by the system, which could be related to standard synchronization adjustments or potentially another obfuscation technique used by malware. The exact impact of these changes requires further corroboration with other system behaviors.

6. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - **Frequent execution of EdgeUpdate process:** Seen in Sysmon logs, the EdgeUpdate process and related processes were executed multiple times. While this could relate to legitimate software updates, coordination with IT policies would be required to confirm this was expected behavior at the specified time.

### Assessment:

This set of logs exhibits a strong indication of potentially malicious activity, particularly due to the following:
- Log clearing actions with administrative privilege.
- Usage of PowerShell to alter system behavior through the registry in a manner consistent with known privilege escalation techniques.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

Given the potential severity and indicators present in the logs, it's recommended to proceed with further forensic investigation and containment measures to ensure any further compromise is mitigated. Steps such as:
- Isolating the host from the network for further analysis.
- Comprehensive malware scanning and log data retrieval from time periods before these events.
- Reviewing user account actions, particularly for `admin_test`.
- Resetting user credentials and securing elevated privileges if misuse is confirmed.

A more thorough investigation by a broader incident response team would be prudent in this context."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several activities that are potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - In the system logs, we notice multiple instances of wevtutil.exe being used to clear event logs (Event ID 104 for LogFileCleared action in System and PowerShell channels and Event ID 1102 in Security logs). The execution under the user ""admin_test"" raises concern as clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain evidence of a PowerShell command being executed to create a new Azure AD user with a potentially malicious script (New-AzureADUser). The command includes sensitive operations, such as setting credentials and creating a new Azure AD user, which is abnormal for typical user operations.

3. **High Privilege Activities:**
   - The security logs show multiple privilege escalation activities (Event ID 4672). Although it's common for SYSTEM accounts to have such privileges, there might still be a need to verify why these activities occur close to other suspicious actions.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, we observe the execution of several processes (powershell.exe, svchost.exe, conhost.exe) and particularly the usage of wevtutil.exe to clear logs, indicating possible malicious intent.
   - The ""IntegrityLevel"" field being ""High"" for several processes executed by ""admin_test"" also suggests elevated permissions were used in execution which needs investigation.

5. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - The PowerShell script includes commands consistent with credential dumping or unauthorized account creation activities, raising red flags about unauthorized administrative actions.

Recommendation for further action:
- Audit the account activity for the user ""admin_test"" to determine whether these actions are legitimate.
- Investigate the purpose and execution context of the PowerShell script, as it seems to perform sensitive operations without clear authorization.
- Assess network traffic logs for signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized access patterns.
- Identify any deviation from standard operating procedures for the creation of privileged accounts in Azure AD.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
The presence of event log clearing, command execution for privileged account creation, and high-privilege operations suggests potentially unauthorized or malicious activity that requires further examination to determine if there's a breach or an insider threat."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that could be indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by a user named ""admin_test"" (EventIDs 104 and 1102 in System and Security logs). This activity can be suspicious as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was used multiple times to clear logs (found in Sysmon logs). Activity related to clearing logs programmatically is often associated with attempts to cover malicious actions.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed to copy a file and interact with COM objects (Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs). The script attempts to configure Microsoft Office add-ins, which could be a legitimate administrative task but also a technique used in persistence mechanisms.
   - The specified PowerShell script makes use of Atomic Red Team scripts. Atomic Red Team is a collection of test scripts designed to emulate adversary behavior for testing detection and defense capabilities. While the use of Atomic Red Team itself is not inherently malicious, it may be indicative of someone attempting lateral movement or exploring exploitation techniques.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Normal Microsoft Edge Update activities are present, involving processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (Sysmon logs). It appears benign and corresponds with regular update patterns.

**Assessment:**
- Given the combination of cleared logs and the use of scripts that emulate adversary techniques, there is credible reason to suspect malicious activity. The continued presence of `wevtutil.exe` commands specifically targeting log clearing, alongside PowerShell execution of scripts in an administrative context, suggests actions indicative of potential compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Initiate a deeper investigation into the user ""admin_test"" to validate their actions.
- Analyze network traffic and other endpoint activity around the timestamps of these events.
- Conduct an integrity check and review security settings on the involved host (Server002) for unauthorized changes.
- Monitor for any further log clearing or PowerShell use by non-standard practices.
- Consider isolating the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement across the network."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"### Analysis of Logs

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- **Command Execution:** The logs show a PowerShell command executing a script to create a new web global module with specific DLL (`%windir%\system32\inetsrv\defdoc.dll`). This action could be legitimate or malicious depending on the context. However, unauthorized changes to web server configuration using PowerShell is often associated with attacks.

#### 2. **Application Log:**
- **Service Stoppage:** There are logs indicating the stoppage of the ""edgeupdate"" service. While this could be normal, repeated and unexpected stopping of services may indicate attempts to disable updates or defenses.

#### 3. **Security Log:**
- **Log File Cleared:** A security log entry with Event ID 1102 indicates 'Log File Cleared' by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is highly suspicious and often performed by attackers to cover their tracks.

#### 4. **Sysmon Log:**
- **Process Termination:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear event logs (cl System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels). This behavior is consistent with log tampering, which is indicative of an attempt to hide malicious actions.
- **PowerShell Execution:** A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) triggered with a script to modify server configurations. This overlaps with the PowerShell log and appears suspicious.
- **Edge Update Activity:** There's considerable Edge Update activity which appears benign as it runs under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

#### 5. **System Log:**
- **Log File Cleared:** There are logs indicating the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs by `admin_test`, reinforcing the suspicious behavior found in the Security log.

### Assessment

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- The repeated clearing of multiple event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test` is characteristic of a cover-up in a malicious campaign.
- The PowerShell command to change IIS configuration without explicit context or change control seems suspect, especially with coinciding log clearance.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to capture memory and disk images for deeper investigation.

2. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Review the activity and access logs of `admin_test` to identify other potentially compromised systems.
   - Verify the legitimacy and necessity of the PowerShell execution and any configuration changes made.

3. **Enhance Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter logging policies to monitor critical systems and minimize log retention attacks.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for real-time threat detection.

4. **Security Awareness:**
   - Educate administrative users on safe practices to avoid credential theft and unauthorized command execution."
