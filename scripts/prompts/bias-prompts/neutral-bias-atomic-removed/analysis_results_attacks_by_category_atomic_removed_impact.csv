Modify VSS Service Permissions,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Indicators of Anomalous or Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616 & 24):**
   - Repeated events of time being set backward by a process identified as `svchost.exe`. It's abnormal for time to be set backward frequently and could be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks in event logs. 
   - Potentially suspicious if not part of a routine maintenance or scheduling operation.

2. **Privileged Logon Sessions (Event ID 4672 & 4624):**
   - User ""admin_test"" is logging on with high privileges multiple times in a brief period using NTLM authentication and from the same workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   - While NTLM authentication isn't inherently malicious, repeated privileged logins in quick succession are noteworthy. Especially considering the privileges include debugging, backup, restore, and impersonation, which could be exploited for malicious activity.

3. **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - The `cmd.exe` executing with the command line `sc sdset VSS D:(D;;GA;;;NU)(D;;GA;;;WD)(D;;GA;;;AN)S:(AU;FA;GA;;;WD)(AU;OIIOFA;GA;;;WD)`. This command modifies the security descriptor of the Volume Shadow Copy Service, which is not typical user behavior and might indicate an attempt to change access permissions.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times by the same user is unusual and might indicate event log manipulation or querying.

4. **System Process Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicating ongoing software updates, while benign, should be monitored due to other concurrent suspicious activities.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executions are usually innocuous but can be components of a reconnaissance activity.

5. **Network Address Use:**
   - The logs indicate an IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` which is a link-local address. While not suspicious by itself, it should be verified this is normal traffic within a local network context.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The repeated manipulation of system time correlating with high-privilege logons, and execution of potentially administrative commands suggests activities worth deeper investigation.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Potential log alteration or attempt to obscure tracks by altering timestamps.
- Possible misuse of NTLM for privilege escalation, especially given the elevated privileges of `admin_test`.
- Possible modification of critical system services security descriptors unauthorized.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediately Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase the logging verbosity for critical systems and audit all successful and failed login attempts.
   - Use centralized logging to capture any further attempts at time manipulation or unauthorized privilege use.

2. **Investigate Origin of 'admin_test':**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and its recent activities, including any corresponding changes to security policies and access permissions.

3. **Review and Validate System Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the security settings on services remain intact and have not been modified inappropriately. Compare configuration baselines.

4. **Conduct Incident Response:**
   - Treat the current indications as a potential security incident. This includes conducting a forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine if any malicious software or unauthorized changes were made.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Instruct users to use secure and approved channels for administration and restrict the use of commands related to service configurations.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that require further investigation to rule out any malicious intent, primarily concerning time manipulation, privileged operations, and system modification attempts using administrative commands."
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows logs, here are the key findings that suggest potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Registry Modifications**:
   - There are several events indicating the modification of registry keys related to System Restore. The command line arguments show that the configuration and restoration capabilities are being disabled:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableConfig"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableSR"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f
     ```
     This behavior is potentially harmful as it disables the system's ability to restore to a prior state, making it easier for malicious actors to maintain persistence on the compromised system without being easily mitigated.

2. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**:
   - The use of the Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`) to alter key registry configurations in a manner that impairs system recovery capabilities is highly indicative of behavior associated with malware or unauthorized access. The commands executed aim to disable System Restore features, which could be used to prevent recovery from malicious changes made to the system.

3. **Process Execution by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**:
   - Multiple instances of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. While on its own, this might be part of legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge, combined with registry manipulation and process spawning patterns, it raises suspicion. Additionally, the use of temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\`) for executing programs can also be seen as a tactic used to obfuscate the source of executable files.

4. **No Anomalies in Other Log Sources**:
   - No anomalous activities were noted in the System, Security, PowerShell, or other logs provided. This observation can either suggest benign system operations or that any malicious entity is trying to remain stealthy by operating under the radar of these log sources.

### Conclusions and Recommendation:

- **Assessment**: Given the ability to modify critical system recovery settings via the Registry, the suspicious use of command-line tools under administrative privileges, and the involvement of temporary directories in process execution, these events suggest potentially malicious intent.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**. The concurrent disabling of system restoration features in conjunction with system-level executions that are generally associated with potentially harmful activities strongly suggest the presence of malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movements and assess whether further indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other malicious activities have transpired on the network.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform deeper forensic analysis on the affected machine and other potentially linked systems to identify the full scope and presence of any malware or unauthorized access.

3. **Restore and Protect**: Reverse the registry modifications related to System Restore capabilities and establish stricter monitoring and alerting on similar activities in the future to detect repeat patterns.

4. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to assess the security configurations of other systems and review policies pertaining to administrative controls and software updating mechanisms, specifically around commonly targeted applications like web browsers."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis and conclusion are drawn:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - None were provided. Typically, malicious activity may involve PowerShell due to its scripting capabilities, but there's no information here to analyze.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Entries related to ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" and ""edgeupdate"" do not indicate any immediate malicious behavior. The ""Service stopped"" messages and routine service operations from edge update services appear benign.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Suspicious Usage of `vssadmin` and `wmic`:** 
     - There is a notable event where `vssadmin.exe` was used with the command `list shadows`. While not malicious on its own, `vssadmin` can be involved in ransomware attacks to manage shadow copies. 
     - `wmic shadowcopy delete` is even more concerning, as deletion of shadow copies is a tactic used by ransomware to prevent system recovery.
   - **High Integrity Level Usage:** 
     - The commands were executed under a high integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges were used.
   - **Combo of Tools and Commands:**
     - The usage of `whoami`, `cmd.exe`, and `PowerShell` scripts indicates potential reconnaissance and command execution, often seen in lateral movement or preparation for further attacks.
   - **Edge Update Processes:**
     - The sysmon logs show multiple instances of Edge update service operations. Although these operations seem legitimate under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, they could be important in understanding the system's activities and should be cross-referenced with legitimate system updates.

4. **System and Security Logs:**
   - None were provided for analysis.

### Conclusion

Based on the presence of processes like `vssadmin.exe list shadows`, `cmd.exe /c`, and `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`, there are clear indicators of potential malicious activity, notably consistent with ransomware behavior. The alteration of shadow copies, especially their deletion, is a technique commonly used to ensure there's no recovery from a ransomware attack. Additionally, the use of `whoami` and command line calls indicate attempts to ascertain user permissions and potentially pivot or further exploit the system.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  - Isolate and contain the affected system to prevent any potential spreading of malicious activity.
- **Detailed Investigation:**
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the system to determine the extent of compromise and identify any signs of ransomware starting or already in operation.
- **Backup Verification:**
  - Verify the integrity and availability of backups to ensure data recovery is possible if needed.
- **Patch and Update:**
  - Ensure all systems, especially those with frequent update services like Edge, are fully patched and up-to-date.
- **Review and Monitoring:**
  - Strengthen the monitoring of high-integrity processes and shadow copy-related activities system-wide to detect similar activities in the future.
- **Educate and Train:**
  - Conduct security awareness sessions regarding the risks of executing or allowing scripts that can lead to privilege escalations or system modifications.

By taking these actions, you can mitigate the current threat and bolster defenses against repeated incidents."
Windows - Disable the SR scheduled task,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest arise:

**System Log:**
1. The system log entries show regular events including a Windows update activity and time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which are benign activities.

**Application Log:**
1. The application log shows a Windows Defender update, which is standard. However, there are repetitive entries indicating the stopping of 'edgeupdate' services. While this could be normal, it is worth noting these repeated stops, although not necessarily malicious by itself.

**Sysmon Log:**
1. The Sysmon log entries reveal multiple instances where processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
2. The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `schtasks.exe /Change /TN ""\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SystemRestore\\SR"" /disable` stands out as potentially suspicious. This command is used to disable a scheduled task, and unless sanctioned by company policy, it can be a sign of malicious intent to prevent system restorations, which are often exploited by attackers to maintain persistence or prevent recovery from other attacks.

**Security Log:**
1. The security log entries indicate time change operations, which were logged successfully without anomalies.

**Assessment:**
- While the majority of the log entries show typical system operations, the execution of the command to disable the System Restore task is suspicious. The combination of disabling a recovery mechanism and the use of administrative-level tools by `admin_test` suggests an investigation should be conducted to determine if this was authorized.

**Recommendation:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation. Specifically, verify whether the disabling of the System Restore task was part of an authorized administrative action. This involves checking recent changes made by the `admin_test` account and ensuring its credentials have not been compromised.
- Ensure that logging settings and security measures are properly configured to monitor for unauthorized changes.
- If there is no legitimate reason for these actions, consider reviewing endpoint security policies and conduct a thorough system audit.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` account's recent activities and authorizations.
- Re-enable the System Restore task if it was unauthorized and strengthen monitoring.
- Communicate with system administrators to verify if similar activities have been reported on other systems."
ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed assessment:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution**: 
   - There are events indicating potentially unauthorized command execution using `cmd.exe` and `plink.exe`. The specific command line being executed by `cmd.exe` is attempting to execute plink, a command-line utility used for remote connections over SSH, to connect to an external server (`file.local`) as root and execute a script `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt`. This kind of activity might suggest an attempt to run malicious scripts or gain unauthorized access to remote systems, which is a significant red flag indicating the possibility of remote command and control activities. This behavior is typical of some advanced persistent threats or hacking activities.

2. **Anomalous Activity with High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Various high-integrity processes are executed within a short time frame, such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these utilities are part of standard Windows operations, the simultaneous execution, especially by a non-system user account like 'SERVER002\\admin_test', could indicate an enumeration or persistence mechanism attempting to gather system information or modify event logs — common behaviors in post-exploitation activities.

3. **Frequent Software Update Executions**:
   - Numerous frequent updates and actions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` are recorded. While software updates are routine, the timing and frequency, along with the updates being followed closely by potentially malicious commands, could suggest cover activity for malicious software installation or updates under the guise of legitimate software updates.

4. **Indicators of Possible Privilege Misuse**:
   - Processes associated with critical system paths and utilities appeared to be executing under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account, which could be typical; however, when paired with the other suspicious activities, it necessitates further scrutiny to ensure privileges are not being misused.

This data reflects multiple indicators of anomalous and potentially malicious activities. The execution of SSH commands using `plink.exe` is particularly concerning and may indicate unauthorized external communications or an attack vector for executing payloads on remote systems. In a real-world scenario, such actions are facets of targeted attacks potentially aiming at data exfiltration, system manipulation, or lateral movement within a network.

Resolution and Next Steps:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of malicious activity due to unauthorized command executions and potential compromise of systems.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data leakage.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis and memory dump of the system to uncover additional artifacts or indicators of compromise.
- Review similar logs or activities on other networked machines to determine the scope of the potential breach.
- Ensure that critical data backups are intact and evaluate patch management for any vulnerabilities.
- Tighten the security policies and user access controls to prevent privilege misuse.
- Engage incident response and cybersecurity teams to explore further mitigative and investigative actions."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"Based on the provided event logs, here is a breakdown of potential suspicious or malicious activities discovered in the system:

### System Log
- **Timezone Changes**: The system logs show updates to the system time initiated by `svchost.exe`, which can be normal as part of time synchronization processes. 

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: There is a suspicious PowerShell script that attempts to download a file from `https://file.com/wp-content/uploads/file-file-Logo.png`, save it locally, and change the desktop wallpaper. While altering system settings via PowerShell is possible for legitimate purposes, downloading files from external sources directly to the system is alarming. This could be indicative of a script used for potentially phishing or malicious purposes, especially because it modifies user environment settings (wallpaper).

### Application Log
- **EdgeUpdate Activity**: The application log denotes multiple events around the Microsoft Edge Update service. These entries often appear due to legitimate updates, especially if aligned with update schedules. No direct malicious indicators are found here.

### Security Log
- **Security Time Change Events**: The security logs reflect system time change events correlated with system events, initiated by `LOCAL SERVICE` via `svchost.exe`. These appear consistent with normal time adjustments and no escalation in privileges or unauthorized access is noted.

### Sysmon Log
- **Multiple Command Executions**: The logs show the execution of several system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`). The use of `whoami.exe` and execution of a PowerShell process with a complex script (matched to the PowerShell logs) could suggest command and control activity, especially since it is from a user `SERVER002\admin_test` who may not necessarily be engaging in normal system activities. The presence of .NET framework executables (`csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`) could represent compilation activity potentially for scripting or custom tool builds.
- **Edge Update Operations**: Repeated executions and updates involving Edge Update processes are noted. Generally, these may not be suspicious, however, if the frequency and execution patterns deviate from regular updates, further investigation into the specific binaries and communication patterns might be warranted.

### Overall Observation
The primary indicator suggesting suspicious activity lies within the PowerShell log, which shows a script being executed that modifies local settings based on external downloads. Such scripts, particularly targeting the wallpaper setting using remote images, may indicate malicious payloads or phishing attempts to establish control or persistence within the user environment.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There is suspicious scripting activity involving PowerShell that requires further investigation. The activity may be benign for system customization purposes or could be used for malicious actions. It is recommended to:
1. Validate the source and intent of the PowerShell script and external resources accessed.
2. Conduct a thorough review of the admin_test user's actions and any associated logins.
3. Scan the system for any additional unauthorized changes or malware presence tied to downloaded contents.
4. Consider network activity associated with the system during the same period.

The situation needs further investigation before confirming it as strictly malicious."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of suspicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show multiple PowerShell executions associated with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. A specific PowerShell command attempts to remove a user (`remove_user`) from the ""Domain Admins"" group, utilizing elevated privileges (`super_user`). This behavior is typical of administrative actions or potentially malicious activity attempting role or permission modifications.
   - The command-line used with `PowerShell` contains unsanctioned use of sensitive operations, indicating the possibility of unauthorized privilege manipulation.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could suggest log tampering or cleanup attempts, as `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing event logs.

3. **System Utilities Usage:**
   - Legitimate Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wermgr.exe` were executed, although their usage during suspicious activity warrants scrutiny. Such utilities can be leveraged for reconnaissance by adversaries.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated installation processes are logged. These belong to legitimate activities when automatic updates occur but should be examined to confirm legitimacy and check against unwanted or malicious application installations.

5. **Process Spawn Patterns:**
   - Several command-line executions indicate automation framework use or scripting for administrator-level tasks, which, combined with suspicious power use, is significant.

### Risks and Threats Identified:
1. **Unauthorized Privilege Escalation:**
   - Attempt to manipulate Active Directory group memberships using administrative commands without proper documentation or request.

2. **Potential Log Manipulation:**
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` in the context of file and log management indicates possible attempts to clear or alter event logs to cover tracks.
   
3. **Scripting and Automation Use:**
   - The presence of complex command-line PowerShell script execution, which may signify an obfuscation of harmful operations.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Investigate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for potential insider threat. Verify if these actions were authorized or intended.
  - Evaluate Active Directory change logs to determine if unauthorized group membership changes succeeded.
  - Monitor the network and endpoint for any further suspicious activities, focusing on log clearances and unauthorized accesses.

- **Threat Detection and Prevention Measures:**
  - Implement stricter controls on script execution and administrative task automation, using tools such as AppLocker or advanced PowerShell logging.
  - Ensure stringent security information event management (SIEM) alerts are set for unauthorized use of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell across critical environments.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain suspicious activity, specifically, unauthorized PowerShell use and potential log tampering, which necessitates further investigation to confirm if it attributes to a benign or malicious cause."
Delete User - Windows,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis of the events with respect to any suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis:

**System Logs and Event Handling:**
- There are multiple instances of the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Time Service logs. These logs indicate changes and synchronizations in system timestamp settings, which are generally benign when associated with system processes such as `svchost.exe`.

**Security Logs:**
- **Event ID 4616:** This reflects a change in the system time. While changes in system time can be suspect if unauthorized, they often happen during regular time synchronization events.
- **Event ID 4624, 4672, 4728, 4720, 4722, 4738, 4724, 4732, 4733, 4729, 4726:** These events show the creation and deletion of user accounts, as well as privilege assignments. The account `fileUser` was created, privileges assigned, and then quickly deleted by `admin_test`. The operations include adding `fileUser` to a user group and privileged operations like changing account settings. This pattern is often indicative of suspicious behavior like privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Executions (Sysmon Event ID 1, 5):** The execution of commands that include user account creations and deletions (`net user fileUser User2DeletePW! /add & net.exe user fileUser /delete`) with high integrity level by `admin_test` in a short timeframe is highly unusual. This batch of system-level commands suggests potentially malicious script or admin exploitation.

**Command-Line Operations:**
- `cmd.exe` running commands to create and delete users, particularly with rapid account modification, is an indicator of potential malware-related activities or unauthorized administrative access.

**No PowerShell logs are provided** to evaluate further command line operations involving scripts, which is often how advanced threats operate on Windows systems.

### Conclusion and Recommended Resolution:

Based on the analysis, several actions and events within the logs suggest that the behavior is malicious:

- The creation and deletion of user accounts and their corresponding assignment to groups are done in a rapid sequence without clear administrative reasoning.
- The usage of command-line utilities (`cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `conhost.exe`) in conjunction with these account operations suggests potentially automated, unauthorized tasks performed by an administrative user or compromised account.
- The privileges being assigned and revoked from users are typical of attempts to bypass security controls or establish backdoor access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response:** Initiate a full investigation and forensics analysis of the affected system(s) to confirm the scope of the activity.
2. **Review Audit Logs:** Examine other security logs, specifically PowerShell or additional command-line execution logs not included here.
3. **User Access Review:** Initiate a review and confirmation of all recent user account activities and changes—check especially for discrepancies in expected administrative activity.
4. **Network Monitoring:** Increase scrutiny on network traffic patterns related to the affected accounts and systems.
5. **Security Posture Assessment:** Conduct a security assessment to ensure that the endpoints have the correct policies applied and that logging and alerting systems are correctly configured. 

Concluding a malicious action resolution is based on the interpretation of the logs provided, lacking additional context. Always cross-reference with other security platforms and incident reports."
Overwrite deleted data on C drive,"In this investigation, I analyzed the provided Windows event logs to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Events 4616, 4624, and 4672 are quite standard in Windows environments:
     - Event ID 4616: This event indicates a system time change, which can be benign if performed by an authorized user or service. It was executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows service host process.
     - Event ID 4624: Successful logon events using Logon Type 5 (which is usually for service logons) and Type 3 (network logon) are recorded. Usernames `SYSTEM` and `admin_test` are involved; `admin_test` is an administrator account.
     - Event ID 4672: This event indicates that the `admin_test` user has special privileges, which is expected for an administrator.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry is related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which appears to be a legitimate check for software licensing or activation. There are no anomalies.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous process creation events (Event ID 1) and process termination events (Event ID 5) are recorded. Notably:
     - Executions of benign system utilities, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, which are legitimate Windows processes.
     - A specific command `cmd.exe /c cipher.exe /w:C:` stands out as it is used to securely overwrite free space on a drive. This could be suspicious if executed without a clear administrative task or backup reason.
     - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge installation are legitimate. They reflect routine software updates.

4. **System Log:**
   - Similar time change events as logged in the Security log, consistent with time synchronization.

### Assessment:

While there is considerable administrative activity, such as using `cipher.exe` for wiping free space, which can be potentially suspicious if unwarranted, the overall pattern aligns with maintenance activity or internal systems management functions. The presence of command-line utilities and their executions seem initiated by a legitimate system account (`admin_test` with administrative privileges), but further context would be essential to entirely rule out any concerns.

### Final Resolution:

Given the logs provided, the identified activity is not definitively malicious. However, because the use of `cipher.exe` for wiping the free space could represent an unusual activity for standard users and there are activities tied to user `admin_test`, it requires further validation with IT management or the responsible administrator to verify the purpose of these commands:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Review Administrative Actions**: Check if the use of `cipher.exe` was part of routine maintenance or IT policy. If not, verify the intention behind it with the respective admin.
2. **Validate System Integrity**: Ensure that `admin_test` activities are all accounted for and verify the unusuall processes against official change management records.
3. **Continue Monitoring**: Increase surveillance on `admin_test` account activities and restrict excessive privilege use if not necessary."
Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"Upon examination of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made that suggest a highly suspicious activity warranting further investigation:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test` suggests attempts to manipulate event logs or interact with console host interfaces, commonly associated with trying to clear tracks or evade detection.
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` running and the command `cmd /c 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe' -c '$env:temp\\test.txt'` executed through PowerShell indicate the encryption of files, possibly suggesting data exfiltration or attempts to conceal malicious payloads.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` is used to query security identifiers (SIDs) related to multiple user accounts such as `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `Guest`, and service accounts like `sshd` and `WDAGUtilityAccount`. This behavior could indicate privilege enumeration or preparing for lateral movement.
   - The privilege escalation where detailed accounts were retrieved by processes (Event IDs 4798 and 4799) from `CompatTelRunner.exe`, typically associated with Microsoft's telemetry, could suggest these tools are being misused for gathering information about local accounts and groups.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell HostApplication showing execution of what appears to be a command line encrypting a test file corroborates suspicious behavior, particularly if such actions are atypical for the admin user `admin_test`.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
- The patterns observed, such as frequent creation and usage of console host instances (conhost.exe), PowerShell scripting activity involving file encryption, and querying of security-related information using legitimate Windows system processes, suggest potential misuse for malicious purposes.
- There is evidence indicating at least reconnaissance and possible preparation for further malicious actions (like privilege escalation or data exfiltration).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit `SUSPICIOUS` behavior. Further investigation should be conducted to ascertain the full context and intent behind these activities. Actions include:
- Conducting a thorough review of recent system changes, network activity, and any unsanctioned accounts or privilege escalations.
- Analyzing any potential data access or exfiltration by examining external data transfers or unusual outbound connections.
- Reviewing the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` privileges and conduct for any signs of credential compromise or rogue activities.
- Enhancing monitoring for further suspicious activities, putting additional focus on potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Application, Sysmon, and assuming information from the missing logs:

1. **Application Log**
   - The entries indicate that the `edgeupdate` service stopped at two separate times (EventRecordID 2385 and 2386). This in itself is not suspicious, as services are routinely stopped and started for updates, troubleshooting, or system maintenance.

2. **Sysmon Log**
   - Several instances of common Windows utilities and Edge update processes being executed are noted. These include `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. 
   - Standard utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are used to gather system and user information, which are legitimate activities if performed by authorized users or processes.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line parameters utilizing `plink.exe` to establish SSH connections appears highly suspicious. Specifically:

     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esx_pkill.txt""
     ```

     This indicates an attempt to execute a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esx_pkill.txt` on a remote host under the username ""root"", which is indicative of unauthorized remote access or a test using hardcoded credentials. The use of `plink.exe` (a command-line interface to PuTTY's backends) can suggest tunneling or direct remote command execution.

   - Other entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes are benign and expected as part of Microsoft's routine browser update mechanism. The use of SYSTEM as the executing user for EdgeUpdate processes is typical.

3. **Potential Threat or Compromise**
   - The most concerning indicator is the use of Plink for what appears to be an automated/scripted SSH connection using administrative privileges and what seems to be plaintext hardcoded credentials. Such behavior is a strong sign of potential unauthorized activity or misconfiguration that could be exploited maliciously.

### Conclusion

Based on the details above, the overall assessment leads to a resolution of **MALICIOUS** due to:
- The use of `plink.exe` with potential hardcoded credentials to execute commands on a remote system.
- The nature of the command implies potential unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration attempts.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate and validate the legitimacy of the `cmd.exe` initialized by `plink.exe` command with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Change any static, possibly hardcoded, credentials associated with this server or operation.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of firewall and network logs to check for unauthorized access or data transmission.
  - Review and ensure SSH access policies are strictly enforced and secured, disabling any unnecessary root access or plaintext password usage.
  - Quarantine the involved systems and conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the scope of the potential compromise.

- **Long-term Recommendations:**
  - Implement stricter endpoint detection and response solutions to spot and alert similar unauthorized activities.
  - Provide security training to prevent the use of hardcoded credentials and ensure secure scripting practices are followed.
  - Review the current update and logging processes, ensuring they can't be used maliciously, and consider the use of logging solutions that highlight and alert on suspicious command execution activities."

Upon examining the provided logs from the Windows host, various activities were analyzed to determine the presence of any indicators of malicious behavior. Key findings are detailed below:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4624:** Indicates a logon event. The logon type `5` is a service startup, which is typically benign when `SYSTEM` is the target user.
   - **Event ID 4672:** Indicates special privileges assigned to new logons. The inclusion of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` is noteworthy because it allows for advanced system capabilities, though it is typical for the `SYSTEM` account.
   - **Event ID 4799:** Relates to group membership enumeration, which does not raise alarms by itself; however, if repeated excessively in a short period, it might necessitate more scrutiny.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Command Execution:** The PowerShell command referenced `vssadmin resize shadowstorage /For=C: /On=C: /MaxSize=20%` is being executed. While this command can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, such as managing disk space for shadow copies, it can also be used maliciously to delete shadow copies in preparation for ransomware attacks.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Processes of Interest:**
     - **vssadmin.exe:** Its execution with parameters linked to resizing shadowstorage aligns with the PowerShell command observed. This could be normal system administration; however, combined with command history, it warrants attention.
     - **VSSVC.exe:** This process is associated with the Volume Shadow Copy service, and its appearance in logs is expected once shadow storage commands are issued, but it should still be monitored for excessive usage.
     - **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE:** These commands are legitimate and used for environment querying and should generally not raise suspicion when executed by the admin_test user.

4. **System and Kernel-General Log Analysis:**
   - **Time Set:** There is a time change noted around `20:24:14`. While it might be insignificant, unexpected time changes might indicate tampering attempts that can obfuscate event logs.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The logs show several potentially suspicious indicators, including privilege escalation events and usage of PowerShell to run a command that can alter volume shadow copies, an action occasionally linked with ransomware activities. However, these activities can also be legitimate depending on the context and administrative activities being performed on the server.

Given the findings, the conclusion is:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - **Reason:** The combination of powerful privileges, usage of PowerShell to manage shadow storage, and regular service logons as `SYSTEM` in a short timeframe without clear justification or evidence of routine administrative tasks suggests a possible risk that necessitates further investigation.

### Recommendations

- Validate the legitimacy of the PowerShell command execution with the system administrators to ascertain if it correlates with any scheduled changes or tasks.
- Conduct a review of historical administrative actions on Server002 to check for similar activities and confirm if these are part of a regular procedure.
- Deploy further monitoring on the `SERVER002` machine to track future changes related to shadow storage and privilege escalations, and ensure it aligns with expected operations.
- Use threat intelligence resources to cross-reference the SHA256 hashes found in Sysmon logs for any known malicious indicators.

Follow these steps to clear any doubts about the intentions behind the actions recorded in the logs to ensure system security."
Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Windows Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Event 17980 (cmd.exe usage):** 
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument involving `bcdedit` to modify boot configuration is concerning. The command:
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no
       ```
       alters the boot configuration to ignore all failures and disable recovery options. This is often a sign of an attempt to suppress potential warnings/errors that might arise, possibly following unauthorized changes or malware persistence mechanisms.
   
   - **Integrity Level:** High integrity level during these operations adds to the suspicion, as it indicates administrative privileges were used, possibly elevating privileges without proper authorization.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
   - Normal operation observed with Event ID `16384` indicating no irregularities directly.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616):** 
     - The sequence shows slight discrepancies in time adjustments on the system. However, `svchost.exe` making time adjustments as seen with Local Service user is relatively standard operation and suggests legitimate time synchronization with time.windows.com.

4. **Command Line Usage:**
   - **PowerShell Entries:** None directly recorded, but PowerShell could be used in conjunction with other tools silently as seen often in advanced persistent threats.

### Assessment:

The combination of administrative commands to alter critical system configurations, especially those related to boot behavior (`bcdedit`), indicates potential tampering aimed to cover up system modifications or compromise. While individual benign operations might use similar commands for legitimate purposes (e.g., troubleshooting by IT), the suspicious use pattern aligning various high-level privileges and system interruption functionalities strongly suggests unauthorized activities.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the source of administrative access utilized during these times and verify authorization on `SERVER002`.
  - Review access logs and credentials used in remote operations around `bcdedit` command times.
  - Conduct deeper analysis for any possible persistence mechanisms implanted via boot configuration changes.
  - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network for further forensic investigation.
  
- **Secure Environment:**
  - Verify system integrity and consider re-imaging affected machines.
  - Update passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on administrative accounts.
  - Monitor for further unauthorized attempts or similar patterns across the environment.

- **Long Term Measures:**
  - Implement more stringent monitoring for use of system-critical command line operations and privilege escalations.
  - Regularly audit configurations, especially those pertinent to system boot and recovery mechanisms."
Configure LegalNoticeCaption and LegalNoticeText registry keys to display ransom message,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

### Suspicious Behavior & Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Unauthorized Modifications Using PowerShell:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command designed to alter the system's legal notice caption and text found under the current version policies registry of Windows.
   - The command embeds text that suggests a potential ransomware attack by implying data on devices is encrypted and demands contact via an email address ending in ""onionmail.org"" for further instructions.
   - The PowerShell event entries (EventID 600) contain the script: 
     ```
     ""Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System -Name LegalNoticeCaption -Value $newLegalNoticeCaption -Type String -Force, 
     Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System -Name LegalNoticeText -Value $newLegalNoticeText -Type String -Force""
     ```
   - This is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, specifically related to a PYSA ransomware, known for using similar mechanisms.

2. **Privilege Escalation and User Actions:**
   - Multiple security logs (EventID 4672) register the admin_test account receiving special privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, among others, which are not normally required for standard operations. Such privileges may indicate a prepared stage for malicious activity.
   - There is record of an NTLM logon session (EventID 4624) from a foreign IP address (192.168.0.102), which might suggest lateral movement or an attempt to login remotely, potentially unauthorized.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Processes:**
   - Multiple occurrences of process creations for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged, initiated by the `admin_test` user. Though these files are typically benign, their execution pattern calls for more scrutiny coupled with the other identified activities.

4. **System Anomalies:**
   - The Kernel-General log (EventID 1) demonstrates unexpected time adjustments without clear justifications for these changes, which may mask or attempt to disrupt security events’ timing.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence found in the PowerShell logs indicating alterations aligned with ransomware activity, particularly involving text linked with PYSA ransomware behavior, and compounding suspicions from privilege escalation tactics and irregular processes executed by the `admin_test` user, the logs strongly lead to indicating malicious activity on the evaluated Windows host.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS:** The provided logs show clear evidence of malicious activity, primarily a ransomware attack confirmed through unauthorized registry changes via PowerShell, suspicious process execution patterns, and potential privilege escalations. Immediate actions are required to isolate the affected system, conduct a thorough investigation, and engage incident response protocols to mitigate further damages and potential data breaches."
Akira Ransomware drop Files with .akira Extension and Ransomnote,"Upon carefully reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entries in the Application log indicate regular system operations like service stops related to ""edgeupdate"" and ""Software Protection Platform Service"" starting. No immediate signs of malicious activity are noted in these events.

2. **System Log:**
   - The System log reflects normal kernel operations, time adjustments, and selection of time sources. These entries do not present any direct indication of malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** There is a series of Sysmon events involving PowerShell execution. The command executed in PowerShell is highly concerning as it involves writing data to files named with "".akira"" extensions and creating a file named ""akira_readme.txt"" on the user's desktop. The content written includes instructions for contacting via the Tor network, which is a technique commonly associated with ransomware operations.
   - The PowerShell script appears to be part of a ransomware operation attributed to the Akira group. Such scripts are typically used to encrypt data and to leave ransom notes.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon logs, logging the execution of a PowerShell command similar to those used in ransomware attacks. It details a series of echo commands writing to a ""akira_readme.txt"", consistent with ransomware instructions.

5. **Security Log:**
   - The Security logs show an admin-level account (`admin_test`) being used, which performed privilege tasks and a subsequent login. Presence of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., along with a type 3 logon from an internal IP (192.168.0.102), suggest legitimate high-privileged activity. However, this can also be a sign of post-exploitation actions by a threat actor using stolen credentials.

### Assessment:
- **High Confidence Malicious Activity:**
  - The execution of a PowerShell script with content similar to known ransomware notes is a clear indicator of compromise.
  - The presence of administrative-level user actions preceding these suspicious activities further reinforces the possibility of a security breach.

### Resolution and Guidance:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - **Immediate Actions:**
    - Isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
    - Perform a thorough investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise, including potential data loss and other affected systems.
    - Review access logs and user activity, particularly for `admin_test`, to identify how the unauthorized PowerShell activity was initiated.
  - **Long-term Actions:**
    - Conduct a security audit of all systems and update security policies to prevent future incidents.
    - Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and alerting on behavior such as unusual PowerShell executions and privilege escalations.
    - Ensure off-site backups are intact and review your incident response plan, emphasizing ransomware preparedness and user awareness training."
Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor,"### Analysis of the Provided Logs:

Upon analysis of the provided Sysmon, Security, and System logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activities were identified:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - **Context & Suspicion**: `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows Event Logs. Its frequent execution in quick succession could indicate an attempted clearing of event logs to hide tracks if combined with `powershell` commands.
   - **Further Investigation**: Check the command-line arguments used when running these processes, as none are shown in the logs.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Unknown Commands**:
   - **Context & Suspicion**: The presence of a command using `cmd.exe` to run what appears to be `dcrypt.exe` (not provided in standard Windows installations) is uncommon and could suggest potentially unwanted software or malicious activity.
   - **Further Investigation**: Verify the existence and purpose of `dcrypt.exe` in the location `PROGRAMFILES\\dcrypt\\` and check the hash to validate its integrity.

3. **Presence of Elevated Integrity Level**:
   - Events related to several processes, like `powershell.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed with a high integrity level. While this might happen under normal administrative tasks, combined with uncommon processes, such as `dcrypt.exe`, it raises flags for privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Multiple `Sysmon Event ID 5` Entries**:
   - **Context & Suspicion**: These entries relate to process termination, showing that numerous processes started and then were promptly terminated. While not inherently suspicious, the lack of context or follow-up logs makes it difficult to assess these events' nature.

5. **EdgeUpdate Process**:
   - Process entries related to EdgeUpdater could be routine updates, but when analyzed in the context of security auditing events, they don't seem immediately harmful. However, ensuring that these execution paths are trusted is vital.

6. **Security Log Event ID 4799**:
   - **Context & Suspicion**: The security log shows a group membership enumeration event, which could be benign unless paired with other suspicious activities.
   - **Further Investigation**: Correlate any similar log IDs or SID entries with known user accounts and their respective roles/permissions in the network.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the logs provided, there are specific activities, such as the repetitive and unlabeled execution of processes like `dcrypt.exe`, combined with the high number of executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which are suspicious. However, due to incomplete context such as specific command-line arguments and additional corroborating malicious behavior, determining definitively that these actions are malicious is difficult without further evidence.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs present activities that, while not definitively malicious, warrant further investigation. Additional details such as `dcrypt.exe`'s hash check, the command line of `wevtutil` execution, and verification of accepting software updates (EdgeUpdate) would provide clarity.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Locate and analyze `dcrypt.exe`**: Determine its legitimacy and source by verifying with known software inventories and checking its hash.
2. **Audit Administrator Activity**: Verify if the `admin_test` account was used legitimately during tasks correlating with suspected entries.
3. **Confirm Log File Integrity**: Ensure `wevtutil` was not used for illicit log clearing.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Perform network traffic monitoring to identify potential external connections or data exfiltration.

By taking these steps, we can ascertain or eliminate the potential of compromise on the device in question."
Windows - wbadmin Delete Windows Backup Catalog,"In examining the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Usage of Wbadmin to Delete Backup Catalogs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of the command `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet`. This action, performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, could be indicative of malicious behavior if it was not authorized or expected by the system administrators. The deletion of backup catalogs could be an attempt to remove data recovery options.

2. **Repeated Edge Update Executions:**
   - There is a significant amount of activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is part of the Microsoft Edge Update process. While such activities can be routine, the frequency and distribution of these processes might require further examination to rule out an anomaly or exploitation, especially if any updates were not scheduled or expected.

### Logs Supporting Routine Activity:

1. **Authentication and Privilege Use:**
   - There are multiple `EventID 4624` logs indicating successful logons, and `EventID 4672` logs reflecting the assignment of special privileges to the SYSTEM account. These entries appear routine and in line with system operations for managing services and backups.

2. **Common System Executions:**
   - Processes such as `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `vdsldr.exe` are found running under typical system services accounts (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `LOCAL SERVICE`), working as expected activities associated with operating system housekeeping and maintenance.

### Assessment:

The primary areas of concern from these logs are the use of the `wbadmin` command with parameters that suggest a potential cleanup or eradication tactic, which can align with ransomware or other destructive attacks aimed at disrupting backup capabilities. Given that unauthorized manipulation of backup utilities is a common tactic for threat actors to ensure persistence of an attack by eradicating recovery options, this activity raises red flags.

### Conclusion:

This set of logs contains an activity that is **SUSPICIOUS** due to the usage of `wbadmin` to delete backup catalogs, which could indicate potentially malicious intent if such actions are not part of regular administrative maintenance or are unauthorized. The high volume of Edge update processes also merits additional scrutiny.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Verify the Legitimacy of Backup Catalog Deletion:**
   - Contact system administrators or review change management records to determine if the backup deletions were planned and authorized.

2. **Review Edge Update Timing and Legitimacy:**
   - Confirm whether the updates and their frequency align with organization policy or scheduled activities. Inspect any abnormal patterns or scheduled tasks that might correlate with these events.

3. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate for any unauthorized access attempts, modifications to security settings, or presence of known malware signatures related to the observed behaviors.

4. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring on backup-related activities and critical system files to detect attempts at data erasure or unauthorized access in real-time."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided logs from PowerShell, Security, Application, Sysmon, and System, the following observations can be deduced:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis:
- **Command Execution**:
  - The command `powershell.exe & {Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}}` is executed multiple times. It is designed to enumerate and delete all shadow copies on the machine.
  - Shadow copies are often targeted by ransomware and other malicious scripts to eliminate backup restore points, thereby making recovery from an attack more difficult.

### Security Logs Analysis:
- **Time Discrepancy**:
  - There is a noticeable anomaly where system time was modified (`EventID 4616`). This type of event can indicate an attempt to cover tracks by altering timestamps related to log entries.
  
- **User Privilege Events**:
  - User `admin_test` received high-level privileges (`EventID 4672`). The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, which are notable for potential misuse.
  - Multiple logons by `admin_test` using NTLM (EventID 4624) from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` indicate remote access and possibly unauthorized access if the workstation is unknown.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
- **Execution of System Utilities**:
  - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` is noted, which suggests possible interaction with event logs and terminal windows respectively. This can be common administrative behavior but is noted due to frequency.
  - Execution of `whoami.exe` alongside powershell commands can be part of reconnaissance activities to gather user context.

- **PowerShell Execution**:
  - Notable execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command pattern, linking back to the shadow copy deletion observed in the PowerShell logs.

### System Logs Analysis:
- **Time Sync Activities**:
  - Events related to synchronization with an external time source were observed without issues, except for the intentional time setting changes as discussed.

### Assessment:
There are clear signs of suspicious behavior that could indicate malicious activity or compromise:
- The deletion of shadow copies through PowerShell is typically indicative of malicious actions attempting to remove recovery capabilities.
- Time manipulation is a tactic often used to obfuscate an attacker’s presence or activities.
- Elevated privileges and multiple connections using NTLM, especially if from an unknown or compromised workstation, add to the concern.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity, notably the deletion of shadow copies and time changes, which is concerning and warrants further investigation.
  
### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Block and isolate the affected host to prevent any further changes or execution of potentially malicious commands.

3. **Follow-Up Measures**:
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities and abnormal time changes.
   - Consider deploying additional security controls, such as enhanced authentication measures or even endpoint detection and response solutions, to catch similar activities in the future."
Windows - Stop service by killing process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis of potential suspicious activity is conducted:

1. **Applications and Updates:**
   - **EdgeUpdate Activity:** There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing with various parameters such as `/svc`, `/update`, and `/regserver`, all executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is characteristic behavior of legitimate software updates and does not inherently indicate suspicious activity.

2. **Service Control Manager Logs:**
   - **Print Spooler (spoolsv.exe) Termination and Restart (Event ID 7031):** This event indicates that the Print Spooler service terminated unexpectedly and was configured to restart automatically. While spooler crashes are not unusual, a manual termination observed in Sysmon events via `taskkill.exe` suggests possible interference that needs further scrutiny.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Command Execution (cmd.exe with taskkill.exe to terminate spoolsv.exe):** The execution of `cmd.exe` running `taskkill.exe /f /im spoolsv.exe` is suspicious. This action forcibly terminates the spooler service, which is uncommon unless executed for administrative purposes or by potentially malign processes.
   - **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe Executions:** Several executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are seen. These are standard Windows commands and while their execution might be typical in troubleshooting, the frequency and pattern need consideration against authenticated administrative activity.
   - **Repeated Execution of Operational Tasks:** Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are noted, potentially indicating log querying or configuration changes; this is not inherently suspicious but context-dependent.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4672:** These indicate a logon and elevation of privileges to access certain rights. Contextually, a logon type 5 is a service startup. Coupled with the execution of Edge Update Service as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, this suggests legitimate service logon activities.

5. **Overall Observations:**
   - The forced termination of the Print Spooler service (`taskkill.exe` on `spoolsv.exe`) without a directly preceding crash logs raises concerns about unauthorized command execution.
   - The consistent pattern of Microsoft Edge Update executions coinciding with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is typical for system services but requires network context to ensure updates aren't tampered with.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The cmd execution leading to termination of spoolsv.exe warrants further investigation to rule out unauthorized or malicious activity. While there may be benign explanations, without sufficient logs indicating legitimate administrative purposes, this activity is flagged as suspicious. Further analysis or investigation, such as reviewing related user activities, network logs, or correlating with user actions during this timeline, is recommended."
Windows - Stop service using Service Controller,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several aspects that warrant further discussion regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - There are repeated Event ID 4616 (Security logs) and Event ID 1 (System logs) related to changes in the system time. These show discrepancies in the system time adjustments, which can sometimes indicate an attempt to obscure activity by altering timestamps. However, these events alone are not definitive proof of malicious activity, as legitimate software updates or system maintenance tasks can trigger such events.

2. **Use of **`wevtutil.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility to interact with event logs, and `conhost.exe` is typically a legitimate part of Windows, dealing with console hosts. The frequent rapid execution in a short period could be normal, but they are worth further review to verify if this is consistent with the user's normal behavior on the system.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c sc.exe stop spooler`, which involves stopping the spooler service. While stopping the spooler service might be a legitimate action (e.g., during troubleshooting), it could also be part of an attack technique, such as disrupting print services or preparing for further malicious activity.

4. **Execution of Windows System Utilities**:
   - Utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed. These are common tools often used for diagnostics, but they can also be leveraged by an attacker to gather system information and verify their access level.

5. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - There are logs related to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components. While these events can be routine, they might also indicate rogue update processes if not expected by the user or administrator.

Based on the analysis, the observed activities, particularly the stopping of the spooler service via `sc.exe`, system time changes, and the frequent execution of certain system utilities, highlight potential areas requiring further investigation to rule out unauthorized activity.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The identified activities do not conclusively indicate malicious behavior; however, they are suspicious and should be investigated further. Specifically, verify whether the activities align with normal administrative tasks or if they represent an anomaly. Additionally, review any network or file system activity that might correlate with these events for potential indicators of compromise.

### Guidance:
- Conduct forensic analysis on `SERVER002` to look for signs of unauthorized access or other malicious activities.
- Check for additional logs or digital artifacts that might support or refute the suspicion of malicious intent.
- Review the security controls and policies around user admin access and normal process execution practices to prevent potential abuse."
Windows - Delete Backup Files,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment of the situation, identifying any potential threats or indicators of compromise:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:
1. **Command Execution**: 
   - Process `cmd.exe` executed a suspicious command to delete various backup and VHD files silently and forcefully: 
     - `cmd.exe /c del /s /f /q c:\\*.VHD c:\\*.bac c:\\*.bak c:\\*.wbcat c:\\*.bkf c:\\Backup*.* c:\\backup*.* c:\\*.set c:\\*.win c:\\*.dsk`
   - This behavior is indicative of potential malicious activity such as a script or malware attempting to erase backups, which is often seen in ransomware attacks or data-wiping incidents.

2. **Repeated Privilege Escalation Events**:
   - Multiple instances of Security ID (SID) and privilege escalation (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) gain for user `admin_test`. 
   - Frequent logon and privilege escalation events could be indicative of lateral movement or attempts to gain persistent higher access.

3. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed with High Integrity Level; although these are common utilities, repeated invocation in a short timeframe could indicate information gathering or reconnaissance on an infected system.

### Assessment:
- The logs indicate suspicious activity with potential signs of malicious intent. The execution of a command to delete critical backup files suggests an attempt to compromise system recovery capabilities.
- High-privilege operations are observed, albeit through users with administrative access, which raises a red flag due to their frequent and clustered appearance.
- No direct evidence of a compromise was found in the form of external connections or known malicious software execution in the provided logs, but the deletion of backups is alarming.

### Guidance:
1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: 
   - Focus on the origin and context of the command executed by `cmd.exe`.
   - Check for other indicators of compromise like unknown external communication attempts, new accounts, or suspicious scheduled tasks.
   
2. **Verify Backups and Data Integrity**:
   - Ensure that all critical data backups are intact and securely stored offline.
   - Restore any deleted backup files if possible and perform a data integrity check.

3. **Monitor for Continued Suspicious Activity**:
   - Increase monitoring on the user `admin_test` and associated processes to detect any further malicious attempts.
   - Consider implementing stricter access controls and multi-factor authentication to reduce risk exposure.

4. **Prepare for Incident Response**:
   - Ensure Incident Response (IR) plans are updated and ready, with emphasis on preventing and responding to ransomware or data deletion attacks.

### Resolution:
Based on the evidence, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS** due to the deletion of critical files under high privileges and requires further investigation and monitoring."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure CLI,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**

The PowerShell logs reveal commands executed on the host that are potentially suspicious. Here's the relevant command execution:
- `powershell.exe & {az login; $userprincipalname = ""file@yourdomain.com""; az ad user delete --id $userprincipalname}`

This PowerShell command includes attempts to login to Azure and delete an Azure Active Directory user. Without context, this command can be highly suspicious, particularly if this action wasn't sanctioned by an administrator or relevant personnel. Deletion of a user from Azure AD can result in loss of access and data, posing a security risk.

**2. Security Logs:**

The security logs contain mostly typical system activity:
- Many Event ID 4624 (successful logon) and Event ID 4672 (special privileges assigned to a new logon), indicating normal system operations.
- There are no abnormal logon types or external IP addresses that might indicate unauthorized access.

However, the privilege elevation `SeDebugPrivilege` grants extensive rights for process inspection, which could be a concern if granted to unverified processes or users. There is no direct correlation indicating malicious exploitation in these logs based on provided data.

**3. Application Logs:**

The application logs primarily feature service stoppages and actions related to the Software Protection Platform and Edge Update service:
- These entries generally indicate routine updates or service actions without direct malicious indicators.

**4. Sysmon Logs:**

Sysmon logs provide detailed process creation events and other system operations:
- There are multiple entries for PowerShell and execution of Azure CLI commands consistent with the PowerShell logs.
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log manipulation attempts, but without context of actions, it might be part of normal administrative tasks.

However, the consistent `FileVersion` and `Hash` matches across multiple entries suggest standard, unmodified system applications are in use.

### Assessment of Situation

After correlating information between PowerShell and Sysmon logs, the attempted Azure AD user deletion stands out as a significant concern. The command line use of user credentials to alter Azure directory settings is unexpected and used by potential threat actors for unauthorized changes.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Identified Threats or Risks**: The command for deleting a user account from Azure Active Directory is a clear indication of a potentially malicious activity unless confirmed as a legitimate administration task.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  - **Immediate Actions**: 
    - Verify with the responsible parties if this PowerShell command was authorized.
    - Check user accounts and privileges on the system and Azure AD for unauthorized changes.
    - Implement monitoring for PowerShell misuse and Azure AD changes.
  - **Long-Term Measures**:
    - Assess the security of access credentials, particularly Azure credentials.
    - Train staff on recognizing and responding to potential unauthorized command executions.
    - Enhance logging and alerting on identity and access management services, especially concerning Azure services.

Conclusive actions to mitigate potential threats and ensure system and data integrity should be prioritized."

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Use of `wbadmin delete systemstatebackup`:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0` is particularly concerning. This command removes all existing system state backups, which is anomalous operation unless being conducted by authorized IT personnel for maintenance purposes. 
   - The command was run under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which might suggest potential misuse of admin privileges if the account is compromised. 

2. **Repeated Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen executing with various command-line arguments (`/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua /installsource core`). This might be normal if an update process for Microsoft Edge is occurring. However, the volume and frequency within a short time period should be further scrutinized to ensure authenticity and correctness of the file paths and versions. 

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed several times by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This tool is often used for manipulating and querying event logs. Unauthorized use could indicate potential log tampering or reconnaissance activities.

4. **`whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` Execution:**
   - The `whoami.exe` command was called, often used to confirm the identity and privileges of the current user session. Unsanctioned use could point to an attempt to ascertain user privileges before executing actions requiring elevated access.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Adjustments in the system time logs via `svchost.exe`, potentially a method to cover tracks in logs of malicious activities by desynchronizing times.

### Security Log Analysis:

- The presence of `EventID 4672` indicates a login session with special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` among others, which might suggest unusual or high-impact activities from the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account.

### Assessment:

The overall review finds multiple points that could indicate suspicious activity that requires further investigation. The presence of operations such as deleting system state backups and potentially unexpected or repeated executions of critical system utilities could suggest the possibility of a targeted attempt to disrupt system operations or cover up unauthorized modifications.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potential severity of these actions if executed with malicious intent, it is advisable to:

- **Immediately initiate further investigative procedures,** including verification of the legitimacy of the activities executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, particularly concerning the backup deletion and event log manipulations using `wevtutil.exe`.
- **Check integrity and origin of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` file** versions and their intended update messages.
- **Review and secure user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`,** ensuring it is not compromised and privileges are as expected.
- **Alert security teams** and consider a more detailed forensic review to understand the depth and breadth of potential compromise.

Further actions should include restoring from a known good backup if intentional malicious activity is confirmed."
Change User Password - Windows,"Based on the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis:

### **Unusual Behavior Observed:**

1. **Creation of a New User Account:**
   - **Event ID 4720**: A new user account `fileAdministrator` was created by the user `admin_test`. This account creation event is accompanied by a password change event, indicating administrative action.
   - **Command Execution**: Sysmon logs indicate command-line execution using `cmd.exe` with `net user` commands which created and set a password for `fileAdministrator`.

2. **Command-Line Usage:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Sysmon)**: Detailing the execution of `cmd.exe` with a combination of `net user` commands to add a new user and modify its password. This is done by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - **Event ID 4728 and 4732**: Indicate changes in the group memberships which might be used to escalate privileges, although these specific group changes (`None` and `Users`) do not suggest direct administrative escalation.
   - **Event ID 4738**: Documentation of account modification for `fileAdministrator` which might involve privilege adjustments associated with UAC values and user control.

### **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**

1. **Suspicious Sequence of Events:**
   - The sequence where `cmd.exe` is executed with `net` commands to create and modify a user account suggests potentially unauthorized administrative actions. Such behavior is often associated with accounts being compromised to escalate privileges or backdoor user addition.
   
2. **Use of Administrative Commands:**
   - The usage of command line tools to manipulate user accounts is a red flag, especially when aligned with `admin_test` execution patterns without documented legitimate need.

3. **Time Frame:**
   - Actions occurring within a very short time-frame (between 12:16:40 and 12:16:41) coupled with multiple user and account changes indicate potential automated script or tool usage, often linked with attack vectors.

### **Assessment and Resolution:**

- The activities surrounding the creation and manipulation of user accounts using command line tools, alongside changes in user group memberships, warrant further investigation.
- Given the indicators observed in the logs including atypical user creation and privilege alteration commands, I would classify this activity as **MALICIOUS**.

### **Recommendation for Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disable the suspicious account `fileAdministrator` immediately to prevent any potential misuse.
   - Change passwords for the `admin_test` account and conduct a thorough review of privileged accounts on `Server002`.

2. **Investigate Source:**
   - Review detailed logs to trace back any IP addresses or remote connections associated with the `admin_test` account, identifying potential sources of unauthorized access.

3. **System Review:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive security assessment on `Server002` to identify any further indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms that may have been established.

4. **Close Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring for similar activities and ensure that robust alerting is set up for unauthorized account creation events and administrative command executions.

By taking these steps, you can mitigate the risk of further exploitation and gain insights into the origin and scope of the activity."
PureLocker Ransom Note,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs**: No logs were provided, therefore any PowerShell activity cannot be assessed.

2. **Application Log**:
   - There are events indicating that the `edgeupdate` service stopped on two occasions (EventIDs 2384 and 2385). Service stops can be routine but frequent stops in succession may warrant further investigation.

3. **System Log**:
   - The logs contain entries related to time service updates (EventIDs 3569 and 3572 for time change and 3570 for time change initiation by `svchost.exe`). Such events alone are not indicative of malicious activity but are worth monitoring if there's no legitimate reason for frequent time changes.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Time changes were recorded in the security log similar to those in the system log (EventIDs 30354 and 30355). These are linked to the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which aligns with expected Windows time service operations.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Several svchost.exe instances and other benign Windows utilities (like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`) were executed, which are typical for Windows operations.
   - However, concerning entries include the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line indicative of a ransomware activity:
     - `\""cmd.exe\"" /c echo data - Purelocker Ransom Note > %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\YOUR_FILES.txt` suggests that there is an attempt to create a ransom note on the user's desktop, a clear indicator of ransomware activity.

   - Another notable observation is the usage of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This tool is used to manage the Windows Event logs and its frequent execution might signal an attempt to evade detection by tampering with logs.

6. **Edge Updates**:
   - Frequent execution and installation/update of Microsoft Edge-related processes appear, e.g., 
     `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe`. While these actions can be benign if they result from legitimate updates, their odd timing or rapid succession might signal lateral movement or persistence mechanisms by an attacker leveraging seemingly benign processes.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the command-line activity observed with the `cmd.exe` process, which suggests ransomware behavior, this log set indicates malicious activity. Additionally, excessive log-related operations and frequent stoppings of `edgeupdate` could support an attempt to mask or execute unauthorized changes.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions**: Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further spread of potential ransomware.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected machine to understand the full scope and entry points of the attack.
- **Remediation**: Consider restoring files from a clean backup and applying updated security measures, including patching and updating all software.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for similar command lines across other systems in the network to detect attempts of lateral movement.
- **Awareness**: Ensure employees are trained on recognizing phishing and other social engineering attacks which are common entry mechanisms for ransomware."
Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the elements to identify any potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activities:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:**

1. **Repeated Event ID 4798 (Group Membership Listing):** There are numerous listings of group membership queries for various user accounts, including `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and more. These events are typically benign when observed occasionally for user enumeration or management purposes. However, a burst of such activities in a short time frame might be indicative of an attacker trying to enumerate user accounts to obtain privileges or map the landscape for privilege escalation tactics.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672 (Logon and Special Privilege Use):** These logs denote the successful logon of the system account (SYSTEM) with elevated privileges. While common for system operations, it stands out due to the concurrent logon and privilege assignment in tandem with other suspicious activities, potentially indicating privilege abuse by a malicious actor. 

3. **Use of PowerShell with Data Deposition and File Deletion:**
    - The PowerShell log reveals the execution of a script designed to check for a specific file (`data.txt`) and then run `sdelete.exe` for deletion. Sdelete is a tool used for secure deletion. Using PowerShell to list or modify files and then deleting with Sdelete is often aligned with malicious data exfiltration techniques meant to cover tracks.

4. **Execution of Unusual Processes:**
    - Sysmon logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` in quick succession, which could be a sign of log tampering or extraction.
    - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` by the `admin_test` user might indicate a user trying to acquire information about the current user context or gather system details.

5. **Presence of External Execution:**
    - The presence of executables from an unusual directory path, `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\Sdelete\sdelete.exe`, implies a potential external tool placed on the system, often a tell-tale sign of unauthorized software execution.

6. **Sdelete Usage:** Usage of Sdelete with `-accepteula` flag indicates acceptance of the EULA without user interaction, which might suggest automated, potentially unauthorized data handling.

**Conclusion:**

- **Assessment:** The combination of user enumeration, elevated privilege interactions, PowerShell scripting for file manipulation, and the invocation of secure deletion tools in quick succession indicates that these actions may not purely be routine administrative tasks but potential indicators of compromise or an ongoing breach scenario.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - These logs demonstrate abnormal activity patterns with the potential for malicious intents, warranting further investigation. 
  - **Recommendations:** 
    - Conduct a thorough review of user activities leading up to and following these events.
    - Examine any associated changes to user accounts or roles.
    - Ensure the system’s integrity and check for any modifications made by the external tools identified.
    - Evaluate PowerShell scripts and confirm the necessity of the tasks executed.
    - Audit other endpoints for similar patterns of behavior to rule out systemic issues."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS):** 
   - Several events related to the `vssadmin.exe` have been recorded.
   - Initial event depicted listing of VSS shadows using `vssadmin.exe list shadows`. This could potentially be a benign operation if conducted by backup services or system administrators for regular checks.
   - A particularly concerning event is the execution of `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` which is used to delete all shadow copies without user prompt (`quiet` flag). This command is commonly associated with ransomware activity, where adversaries aim to delete backup copies to prevent recovery of data after encryption.

2. **Command Line Analysis:**
   - The chain of execution indicates the use of `cmd.exe` with a command to execute `vssadmin.exe` for shadow copy deletion. It's often suspicious if not accompanied by logs or legitimate administrative activity that confirms such as part of routine maintenance.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are seen, which generally in themselves aren’t suspicious but indicate interactive command-line activity. Particularly when correlated with the deletion of shadow copies, they might support malicious intent.

4. **Parent Process Context:**
   - The parent process for many of these activities was identified as `wsmprovhost.exe`. While `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate process associated with Windows Remote Management (WinRM), it could be exploited if a malicious actor gains access via remote management.

5. **PowerShell Use:**
   - Albeit not displaying suspicious script usage, the presence of PowerShell launching administrative tasks without explicit logging of benign activity (like a scripted administrative task) indicates potential misuse.

6. **Windows Updates and System Activities:**
   - Various Edge update activities and system process logs correspond with expected background maintenance and updates associated with Microsoft services.

7. **User Context:**
   - The operations are conducted by a user ID identified as `SERVER002\\admin_test` holding high integrity access, suggesting this account holds elevated privileges suitable for administration. Should this account be compromised, it would be capable of executing critical and potentially destructive commands, indicating a significant risk if unauthorized.

8. **Security Indicators and Mitigation:**
   - The critical indicator of compromise (IOC) here is the scheduled or unsupervised bulk deletion of VSS using `vssadmin.exe`, a tactic used by destructive malware to impede data recovery.
   - Immediate audit of the admin_test user account should be conducted. Verify legitimacy and secure against unauthorized access.
   - Review network access logs and any connections that session might have engaged to identify potential breaches.
   - Monitor for additional IOCs like unexpected encryption events or further deletions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the deletion of shadow copies and the context of execution, there's a high potential for malicious activity. Indicators align with ransomware tactics or preparation for data compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

It is recommended to:
- **Isolate the affected host** immediately for deeper forensic analysis.
- **Perform a comprehensive investigation** on recent logs, network activity, and user account audits to locate other potential compromised assets.
- **Engage incident response protocols** to contain, eradicate, and recover from potential malicious activity."
Logoff System - Windows,"Upon review of the logs provided, the following observations and assessments were made:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
    - The logs capture a series of process creations and terminations largely centered around system utilities and Microsoft Edge Update processes.
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, the `cmd.exe` command with a `/c shutdown /l` parameter, and various Edge update processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are logged.

2. **Suspicious Activities**:
    - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe**: The presence of `wevtutil.exe` can be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as clearing event logs, but the logs do not explicitly show unusual arguments or evidence of malicious usage.
    - **Hostname and Whoami Usage**: The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is relatively benign and typically associated with checking system and user context.
    - **cmd.exe with shutdown command**: The command `cmd.exe` /c shutdown /l indicates a logoff command being issued. This could have been triggered by an administrator intentionally or as part of a script or scheduled task, and by itself is not inherently malicious without context suggesting abuse or unauthorized actions.
    - **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: The frequent execution of various Edge updater components including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` indicates ongoing update tasks. Given that these are signed Microsoft binaries, they typically represent legitimate update actions unless combined with specific tangible signs of compromise or misuse.

3. **Risk Assessment**:
    - At this time, the activities observed seem to align with standard system operations or legitimate administrative tasks. While use of system utilities like `wevtutil` could be part of malicious tactics, no concrete evidence from command lines or abusive parent-child relationships among processes indicate this was the case.

4. **Conclusion**:
    - The logs reviewed predominantly illustrate legitimate activities expected from system updates and minor administrative checks using native Windows utilities.
    - No definitive evidence of malware or active adversarial compromise is observed in the provided data.
    - However, given the nature of some utility usage, these findings could warrant deeper investigation if additional context (such as alerts or an incident) supports it.

Resolution: **BENIGN** - The log activities currently suggest benign operations with no clear signs of compromise.

**Guidance**:
- Continue regular monitoring and alert for any anomalies.
- Verify account activities to ensure they align with expected user behavior.
- Maintain routine checks for updates in your security posture and endpoint detection configurations."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure AD PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several key observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Repeated Process Creation and Execution:**
   - There is a notable pattern of `powershell.exe` executions with the command line pointing towards potential Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) manipulation:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Connect-AzureAD; $userprincipalname = \""file@yourdomain.com\""; Remove-AzureADUser -ObjectId $userprincipalname}
     ```
   - The execution of processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible administration or manipulation activities, especially with elevated privileges (`User=""SERVER002\\admin_test""`).

2. **Use of Privileged Tokens:**
   - Events `4672` in the security log indicate that privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` were employed. These are often used if processes need elevated capabilities or are attempting privilege escalation.

3. **Attempted Credential Access:**
   - Numerous `5379` events with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` reflect failed attempts to access Windows Live or Microsoft Account credentials. The repeated attempts and failures could flag this behavior as suspicious.

4. **Potentially Malicious Command Execution:**
   - Execution of scripts through `Windows PowerShell` that involve the `Remove-AzureADUser` command line can suggest activities aiming at unauthorized account changes, which stand out as potentially malicious.

### Benign Activities:
- **Standard System Operations:**
  - Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and typical system activities logged within `Sysmon` align with regular Windows operations, indicating software updates and system checks.

### Assessment:
Given the repeated use of `powershell.exe` to potentially manipulate AzureAD, along with several failed credential access attempts, the activity is suspicious and indicates a need for further investigation. However, some of these actions may occur in legitimate administrative scenarios.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities, namely PowerShell executions and failed credential access attempts, which warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy or potential malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Examination**: 
   - Analyze the context and timing of the PowerShell script executions, verifying whether these align with scheduled administrative tasks or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Credential Monitoring**:
   - Investigate the source and purpose of the failed credential access attempts and ensure that account configurations and access permissions are secure.

3. **Audit Privilege Usage**:
   - Check which users/processes are making use of significant privileges and confirm if this aligns with administrative policy.

4. **Implement Alerts**:
   - Set automated alerts for critical activities detected, such as unscheduled PowerShell executions that modify directory or user policies.

Conducting these actions can help ascertain the potential risk present and whether any remediation steps are necessary to secure the system."
Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"Based on my analysis of the event logs provided, I have identified several areas of potential concern and suspicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs indicate a time change event (`EventID: 4616`) where the system time was adjusted. Time changes can be legitimate but also may indicate a malicious attempt to manipulate time-sensitive processes or logs.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - Multiple `Sysmon EventID: 1` entries indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `net.exe stop spooler`. The `spooler` service is a known target for attacks because disabling it can affect printing services; historically, it has been exploited in certain vulnerabilities (e.g., PrintNightmare).
   - The `whoami` and `hostname` commands are being run, which can be used for reconnaissance purposes to gather information about user context and system identity.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High Privileges**:
   - The security log (`EventID: 4672`) shows that the user `admin_test` was granted multiple high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others. Although this may be expected for an admin account, combined with other actions, it could be a precursor to privilege escalation or lateral movement activities.

4. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil` Tool**:
   - Repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage by the same user (`admin_test`) are noted. This tool is typically used for managing Windows event logs, and while legitimate for administrative purposes, it could also be used in attempts to clear logs or cover tracks after malicious activity.

5. **No Alerts for Specific Malicious Payloads or Known Threats**:
   - There are no immediate indicators of known malware, such as hashes matching known malicious files or direct evidence of malicious payload delivery or execution.

Given these observations:

- The **time manipulation** and use of **administrative tools (`wevtutil`, `net.exe stop spooler`)** by an account (`admin_test`) with high privileges, along with the reconnaissance commands executed, are indicators that warrant further attention.

My assessment based on logs:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough review of user `admin_test` activities to verify their legitimacy and investigate any unauthorized actions.
- Check if the time change was legitimate and authorized. If not, consider correlating this with other system changes or anomalies.
- Investigate why the `spooler` service was stopped, and ensure that this action is justified and not exploitable by vulnerabilities.
- Consider enhancing monitoring and logging to provide more visibility into the actions of privileged user accounts.
- Employ policies that better restrict the unnecessary use of high-level privileges on user accounts."
