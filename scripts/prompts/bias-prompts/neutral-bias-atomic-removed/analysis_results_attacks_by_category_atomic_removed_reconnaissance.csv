### System Logs
1. **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events**:
   - Multiple events indicate time changes on the system, which are done by the standard `svchost.exe`.
   - The time synchronization with `time.windows.com` is a standard NTP behavior.
   - No suspicious process or anomalies in the Kernel-General and Time-Service logs.

### Application Logs
1. **Security-Spp and Edge Update**:
   - The logs indicate normal operational events, such as the stopping of services.
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopping and related events do not demonstrate any signs of malicious behavior. 

### Security Logs
1. **4624 and 4672 Events**:
   - User `admin_test` logs on and off (EventID 4624 and 4634) using NTLM authentication from an IPv6 link-local address (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`). This could be a legitimate connection if the user typically connects remotely or via a trusted internal network.
   - EventID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` was assigned special privileges often associated with administrative tasks. While these privileges are extensive, there is no direct indicator of misuse within these events.

### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - `Get-CimInstance` command related to listings of imaging devices is detected. The command itself is not inherently malicious but can be used for reconnaissance.
   - No other suspicious PowerShell activities are logged, such as downloading of files or execution of remote commands. However, frequent querying of system information could be concerning depending on the context of usage.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple executions related to `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, appear standard within the operational context; the processes are legitimate Windows utilities typically used for system information gathering or updates.
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` could indicate someone verifying user credentials or environment settings. While often benign, it may still warrant verification of the intent or script that executed it, especially with admin-level user `admin_test`.
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes operating under system authority are consistent with expected software update behavior.

### Overall Assessment:
The logs present a largely typical view of system operations with no definitive indicators of direct compromise or strictly malicious activity. However, monitoring of tools that could be leveraged for information gathering (e.g., `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`) and user activities should continue. There are legitimate reasons these tools could be run, but also potential misuse scenarios in some contexts.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: While there are no clear indicators of compromise or malicious intent, the usage patterns of certain tools and specific privileges prompt a closer review. Further investigation into the context surrounding these events (like the purpose behind `whoami` and PowerShell usage) would be advisable to rule out any potential abuse or unauthorized access attempts."
