Directory Name,AI Response
Copy a sensitive File over Administrative share with Powershell,"Upon detailed examination of the provided event logs, I've identified some key points for analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with the command: `powershell.exe & {copy-item -Path \""\\\\127.0.0.1\\C$\\Windows\\temp\\Easter_Bunny.password\"" -Destination \""$Env:TEMP\\Easter_egg.password\""}`.
   - This PowerShell activity involves copying a file named `Easter_Bunny.password` to a temporary directory. The use of PowerShell to manipulate files in such a manner can be typical of malicious activity, especially if the file being manipulated is a password-related file.

2. **Unexpected Executions**:
   - Frequent execution of utility executables like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and operations aligned very closely with the `admin_test` account. This pattern suggests potential exploitation or misuse of administrative privileges but could also be routine administrative actions.

3. **Edge and Windows Update Processes**:
   - There are several instances related to Microsoft Edge and Windows Update operations (like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`). These processes and updates appear legitimate and expected system maintenance operations.

4. **Process Integrity and User Context**:
   - The operations are executed under a high integrity level, indicating an elevated privilege context. This can be legitimate if performed by an authorized admin but could be alarming if performed by compromised credentials.

5. **System Processes**:
   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe` are all operating under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for these processes in their function for system services, software protection updates, and Windows updates.

### Assessment:
- **Key Observation**: The PowerShell command execution by `SERVER002\admin_test`, focusing on file manipulation of a password-like file using local paths, stands out as potentially suspicious. While there is no explicit evidence of compromise, the nature of the action involving sensitive file copying warrants further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Action**: Further investigation is recommended to clarify whether the `admin_test` actions with PowerShell were legitimate administrative tasks or indicative of unauthorized activities. Verify the authenticity and necessity of the executed script. Assess whether the involved user credentials could be compromised and review the file contents of `Easter_Bunny.password` for unauthorized access or modifications."
ESXi - Remove Syslog remote,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate a significant amount of PowerShell activity. There is a complex script being executed that includes the use of `plink.exe`, which is part of the PuTTY suite, known for secure communication, but it can be used maliciously for unauthorized access.
   - The script seems to be accessing and modifying syslog configurations via SSH on a remote host (`file.local`), possibly manipulating IP addresses.
   - The PowerShell script is run by `admin_test`, suggesting someone with elevated permissions might be executing the script.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple executions of PowerShell and `plink.exe` connected to user `admin_test`.
   - Regular system processes (like svchost.exe, conhost.exe) are observed, which generally indicate normal system behavior, but given the usage context with `plink.exe`, the actions can be perceived differently.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned) are seen multiple times for the `SYSTEM` account, indicating typical system operations.
   - Event ID 5379 indicates credential validation attempts, related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, with associated error codes, which might warrant further inspection or could be routine checks.

4. **Application & System Logs**:
   - Regular updates and system activities such as Windows Defender updating its definitions are observed, indicating normal maintenance activities.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- The use of `plink.exe` in conjunction with SSH protocols to modify configurations on a remote server is highly indicative of potential suspicious activity. While `plink.exe` is a legitimate tool, its use in scripts to automate remote access and changes can be indicative of hacking activities, especially with no clear system admin tasks described.
  
- The execution of PowerShell scripts by an `admin_test` user, performing network operations, can be potentially malicious, especially given that these actions are not typical everyday operations for standard updates or maintenance.

#### Conclusion:

Given the presence of PowerShell scripts leveraging `plink.exe` to interact with remote servers without explicit legitimate context, and the administrative privileges involved in executing these scripts, the activities appear **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is warranted, focusing on the intent and origin of these PowerShell scripts. It is crucial to verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and cross-examine if such operations are typical of its intended use. It is also recommended to check if the configured remote machines (`file.local`) are authorized systems or part of any sandbox environment.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Trace the origin and intent of the script executed via PowerShell.
   - Verify permissions and activities of the `admin_test` account.
   - Inspect network connections and logs of the remote server `file.local`.

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring and logging of PowerShell activities.
   - Ensure that usage of tools like `plink.exe` is restricted to authorized personnel and within secure, documented contexts.
   - Consider endpoint protection solutions to better monitor anomalous administrative activities.

3. **User Awareness & Training**:
   - Reinforce security policies regarding the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - Educate users on recognizing unauthorized or suspicious task executions."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several areas of interest which may warrant further investigation. Let's break down the findings from each log type:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon event with LogonType 5, which corresponds to a service logon. The account involved is the `SYSTEM` account, which is a normal behavior for service operations and doesn’t immediately raise concerns.

2. **Event ID 4672**: Indicates special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account. This is normal system behavior as SYSTEM inherently has elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, among others.

3. **Event ID 5379**: Several credential validation attempts returned a specific error code `3221226021`, which means ""No such logon session"". This could indicate repeated access attempts to a non-existent session, which is odd and may hint at a misconfiguration or a failed script attempting access.

4. **Event ID 4798**: Queries of user information by `taskhostw.exe`. These actions are not unusual if part of a scheduled task, but given repeated errors in credential checks, correlation with these processes should be analyzed further.

### System Logs:
- **Windows Update Activities (Event ID 19)**: Confirm updates relating to Microsoft Defender, showing that the system is applying security updates as expected.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Suspicious Command Execution**: A PowerShell script invoked to recursively compress user profile data into a `.zip` file (`dir $env:USERPROFILE -Recurse | Compress-Archive -DestinationPath $env:USERPROFILE\data-data-ps.zip`). This activity is suspicious and could indicate data exfiltration, especially when executed under an admin account.

2. **Frequent Use of System Utilities**: Processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `dllhost.exe` were executed with relative frequency by the `admin_test` account. While these can be part of typical admin operations, their purpose and context should be verified given other suspicious activity.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**: The suspicious PowerShell activity was executed in a high-integrity session, signifying high privileges, which aligns with potentially unauthorized data aggregation or processing, raising concerns for potential data exfiltration or preparation for lateral movement.

### PowerShell Logs:
- Confirm the suspicious command execution previously mentioned as part of the PowerShell executable command line inputs. This is particularly concerning given its purpose might not align with typical workspace operations.

### Application Logs:
- **Edge Update Events**: There are entries related to `Microsoft EdgeUpdate`, indicating service stops, which can be benign. However, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it should be reviewed to ensure integrity and absence of tampered installations.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The activity observed, particularly the PowerShell script aimed at compressing all user data into a single archive, suggests a potential for unauthorized data exfiltration. Coupled with related high-privilege commands and abnormal credential validation events, these point to possible malicious activity.
- **Recommendation**: Immediate review of logs to understand the exact extent of the data that was involved, alert relevant security incident response teams, and verify the integrity of administrative accounts and recent permissions changes. Also, check all similar PowerShell scripts running on the network, isolate compromised accounts, and enforce stricter monitoring and alerting on critical data movements within the network."
Recon information for export with PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the entries:

### Key Observations:

1. **Application Log:**
   - **Edge Update Events:** The logs contain multiple entries for the ""edgeupdate"" service starting and stopping, which is typical behavior for an auto-update service like that of Microsoft Edge. No unusual command-line arguments or privilege escalations are noted.

2. **System Log:**
   - **Time Change Events:** The system time adjustments logged by the Kernel-General provider are consistent with normal time synchronization activities, especially since they have references to the time.windows.com NTP server.
   - **Service Events:** Standard time service events and other routine system entries are recorded, with no anomalies.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **Time Change Security Events:** These correlate with the system log’s time change events. They show time adjustments executed by usual system processes (`svchost.exe`), with system-level permissions (by `LOCAL SERVICE`), which is typical behavior and does not indicate compromise.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Process Creation Events:** The occurrence of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` is logged. These commands were executed by a user (`admin_test`) and seem part of normal diagnostic or administrative tasks.
   - **PowerShell Activity:** There is a PowerShell execution capturing the environment variables, services, and processes, which could be a red flag if executed unexpectedly or by unauthorized users. However, it appears to be executed under the context of `admin_test`, linked to `wsmprovhost.exe`, suggesting a remote management activity.
   - **Edge Update Related Processes:** Numerous entries relate to the Microsoft Edge Update utility running different update-related tasks. The integrity level is high, and they're executed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, aligned with benign update activities.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **PowerShell Script Execution:** Corresponding log entries validate that PowerShell was executed to collect data such as services, environment variables, and processes. These activities, while potentially sensitive, are not inherently malicious if performed with admin intent to monitor or maintain the system.

### Conclusion:

- **Assessment:** The logs largely exhibit routine activities associated with a Windows host undergoing standard operations like time synchronization, system updates, and maintenance via PowerShell scripts.
- **Risks or Threats:** There is no explicit indication of malicious activities like unauthorized privilege escalation, suspicious processes, or anomalous network operations.

**Resolution: BENIGN**

**Guidance:** While the observed activities appear benign and associated with routine system maintenance, it's crucial to ensure that any administrative actions align with documented changes and operational procedures. Keep monitoring the system for any escalation of similar activities that might require a deeper security review if context changes or anomalies appear."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with 7zip,"Upon detailed examination of the provided Windows event logs across several channels, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Analysis:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The entries primarily detail routine activities such as Windows Defender's state being reported as on, and software protection platform service log. These events do not raise any immediate red flags and appear normal for system health monitoring.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **cmd.exe Execution:** There are multiple instances where `cmd.exe` is being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The activity around `cmd.exe`` with arguments like checking for 7-zip existence and actions associated with `conhost.exe` are somewhat suspicious as they include a command to create a directory and involve checking or utilizing compression tools like 7-zip. Such actions, especially archived with a password (`-pblue`), might be a part of data exfiltration or ransomware-like activities.
   - **File Operations:** The creation and manipulation of directories and files, particularly the creation of a file named `encrypted_file.txt`, and attempts to archive files with 7-zip, is concerning.
   - **wevtutil.exe Operations:** The usage of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate event log manipulation, which could be an attempt to cover up traces of other activities.
   - **Miscellaneous Commands:** While some commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are not inherently malicious, in the context of this activity, they could be used for reconnaissance or verifying system information during exploitation.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The successful logon events and associated privilege escalation events (Event ID 4624 and 4672) suggest legitimate access but do not necessarily indicate unauthorized access.
  
4. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs detail time adjustments and timezone updates. The presence of time updates is not necessarily suspicious in isolation, but frequent time changes could sometimes point to attempts to confuse log timelines. However, this does not appear to be excessive here.

### Conclusion:

The logs exhibit behaviors indicative of unauthorized or suspicious activity, particularly due to:
- Execution chains involving `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and the usage of 7-zip for file modification and possible encryption.
- Commands are run by an administrative test account which might imply internal testing but could also be exploited if compromised.

Given this context, the situation is assessed as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the presence of script-like execution patterns and potential data manipulation/exfiltration attempts. There is a need for further investigation to determine the intention and source of these activities.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the legitimacy of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and validate whether these actions were user-initiated intentionally or as part of a scheduled task/testing script.
- **Audit Logs:** Scrutinize the surrounding logs and network traffic to ascertain the origin of these processes.
- **Isolate and Monitor:** If this activity is not authorized, isolate the server from the network to prevent potential data loss/exfiltration.
- **Examine Network Traffic:** Investigate any external communications during the time frame of these events.
- **Security Tools:** Utilize existing security tools to scan for any known threats related to the observed command-line activities.

Moving forward, this server should be closely monitored, and if any unauthorized access or malicious intent is confirmed, a thorough incident response should be initiated."
Utilize Clipboard to store or execute commands from,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following assessments have been made:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**: The logs predominantly capture process creation and termination events, specifically focusing on the execution of certain processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `clip.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. The process execution listed in the logs, including `whoami.exe`, `clip.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, does not seem inherently suspicious and may be part of regular administrative tasks or scripts executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Notable Observations**:
   - Repeated use of admin-level processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with high integrity levels indicates administrative tasks being run.
   - The use of `clip.exe`, typically used to interact with the clipboard, and commands redirecting to `clip`, is usually harmless unless repeated excessively or paired with malicious payloads.
   - The usage of these utilities, especially `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, often appears in scripting and systems administration for system querying purposes.

3. **Time Manipulation Events**: The Security and System logs show events associated with changing system time. Event IDs 4616 in the Security log and 1, 24 in the System log are indicative of time discrepancies adjustments often associated with legitimate time synchronization processes. The events were logged very close together in time and show a rollback of timestamps, possibly indicative of time synchronization from an NTP server. 

4. **Security and System Logs**: There are no explicit signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalations. The time adjustments seem consistent with synchronization activities and involve processes running under `LOCAL SERVICE` and network-related users, which is typical for such operations.

5. **Application Log**: The relevant entries primarily indicate system operations like those related to the Software Protection Platform Service. No indications of malfunction or compromise are apparent.

**Conclusion**:
- There are no concrete indicators of malicious activity. The behaviors observed are consistent with scripted administrative tasks or typical user queries for system information.
- The processes executed and system activities logged seem to revolve around hostname checks, user-identification commands, and minor background tasks that do not inherently raise suspicion.

**Resolution**: **BENIGN** - The logs contain benign activity characteristic of standard administrative function or scripting tasks. There are no direct red flags or malicious indicators requiring further action. However, maintaining routine monitoring and inspection of such activities is recommended to ensure consistency and detect any deviations from standard behavior in the future."
Execute Commands from Clipboard using PowerShell,"Upon review of the logs provided, there are several points to consider regarding potentially suspicious or malicious activity on the Windows host (Server002).

### Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log

A notable observation is the PowerShell command executed:
```
powershell.exe & {echo Get-Process | clip, Get-Clipboard | iex}
```
This command attempts to execute what is in the clipboard. Here's what it does step-by-step:
1. `echo Get-Process` - Puts the output of the `Get-Process` command into the clipboard.
2. `clip` - Copies data into the clipboard.
3. `Get-Clipboard` - Retrieves what is currently in the clipboard, which could be any text replaced by a malicious user copying sensitive data.
4. `iex` - Executes the content retrieved from the clipboard.

This command chain is suspicious, particularly the use of `Invoke-Expression (iex)` with clipboard content, which can execute arbitrary code. This action is a common technique in PowerShell-based attacks to obfuscate and execute malicious code unsuspectingly.

#### Sysmon Log

Several legitimate system processes are initiated around the same time:

- `hostname.exe`
- `whoami.exe`
- `wevtutil.exe`
- `clip.exe`
- Various instances of `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host)

These processes, in isolation, are not typically suspicious as they perform routine operations. However, the presence of `clip.exe` in conjunction with the PowerShell command mentioned raises a red flag. `clip.exe` facilitates manipulation of the clipboard which can be useful in data exfiltration or facilitating further script executions via clipboard contentings, as noted earlier.

The execution of `wevtutil.exe` could be considered normal under certain administrative activities, such as log management, but merits investigation if not correlating with expected activity.

There is no direct evidence of parent processes that suggest an unauthorized or malicious origin, and the processes match known legitimate Windows paths and hashes.

#### Application Log and Others

The Application log's entries appear typical for system operations (e.g., Edge update service stopping) and software protection updates. Security and System logs do not appear in the provided data, so we cannot make conclusive statements about authentication events or system-level service changes.

### Conclusion

Given the PowerShell activity involving clipboard execution (`iex`) masked as a benign `Get-Process` command, combined with the use of `clip.exe`, there is potential for this action to be part of a shadow or hidden operation executed by a user with privileges to run PowerShell scripts.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

This incident warrants further investigation to determine:
- The origin and context of the PowerShell command execution.
- Clipboard contents at the time of execution and any subsequent actions or network connections.
- A deeper inspection into user `SERVER002\admin_test` activity logs and any sessions indicative of unauthorized access.

Steps to proceed:
1. Corroborate these findings with network logs to check for external connections or data transfer.
2. Analyze user activity with added scrutiny on PowerShell usage through deeper log inspection or audits.
3. If further confirmation arises pointing to an attack or unauthorized use, escalation and remediation strategies may need to be deployed, such as isolating the machine for forensic investigation."
Office365 - Remote Mail Collected,"Based on the provided event logs, let's analyze the data for any suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script with several advanced functions, including the use of `ConvertTo-SecureString`, creating a self-signed certificate (`New-SelfSignedCertificate`), and accessing Microsoft Graph API via token authentication.
- Establishing a new service principal (`New-MgServicePrincipal`) and application role assignment (`New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment`) with potentially sensitive scopes like `Mail.Read` suggests the script is attempting to access email data through Microsoft Graph.
- The redirection to `http://localhost` and the lack of user interaction or explicit credentials might indicate unauthorized access attempts or a potential setup for lateral movements.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- The Sysmon logs contain events showing processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `admin_test`.
- Presence of `PowerShell` executing under `SERVER002\admin_test` indicates a potential use of scripts which aligns with the activities seen in the PowerShell logs. While the commands by themselves (`hostname`, `whoami`) are standard and not inherently malicious, in conjunction with the PowerShell activity, they might be recon attempts.

### Security Log Analysis
- The security log shows a logon event (`EventID: 4634`), indicating a logoff for `admin_test`. This suggests that the activities took place while a session was active and legitimate.

### Risk Assessment
- The PowerShell script aims to read user emails by using Microsoft Graph API with what appears to be default or hardcoded values for authentication which could be indicative of a phishing or data exfiltration effort.
- Creating a self-signed certificate for user or application impersonation is another point of concern.
- Given the sequence of activities and the nature of the PowerShell script involved, it manifests characteristics of privilege escalation and unauthorized data access.

### Conclusion
Based on the evidence provided in the logs:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance and Next Steps
1. **Immediate Action:** 
   - Terminate any suspicious sessions or processes identified on `Server002`.
   - Change credentials for the user `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full audit trail for `admin_test` to identify any further compromised activities or attempted lateral movements.
   - Examine any data accessed or modified during the timeframe of the events for breach assessment.
3. **Remediation and Monitoring:**
   - Implement additional logging and monitoring for script execution (especially PowerShell) and external access attempts to sensitive resources.
   - Consider deploying conditional access policies to restrict access to critical cloud resources via Microsoft Graph.

This analysis indicates an immediate need for security response to prevent any data leakage or further compromise."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winzip,"After analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host ""Server002,"" we can make the following observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**

   - **Command Execution:** The logs show that `cmd.exe` has been executed multiple times. Notably, one command line includes:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c ""if not exist ""%%ProgramFiles%%\\WinZip\\winzip64.exe"" (echo 1) else (echo 0)""
     ```
     This suggests a check for the existence of the WinZip executable, which in itself is not inherently malicious. However, it indicates an interest in WinZip's presence, possibly for compression operations.

   - **Potentially Malicious Command:** Another command executed via `cmd.exe` seems suspicious:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c path=%%path%%;""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\winzip"" & mkdir .\\tmp\\victim-files & cd .\\tmp\\victim-files & echo ""This file will be encrypted"" > .\\encrypted_file.txt & ""%%ProgramFiles%%\\WinZip\\winzip64.exe"" -min -a -s""hello"" archive.zip * & dir
     ```
     This command suggests the creation of a directory and file, followed by the use of WinZip with a password to archive files, potentially indicating encryption of files (hinting at ransomware behavior).

   - **Execution of Enumeration Tools:** There are also logs indicating execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which are commonly used for system and user enumeration. While these are standard Windows tools, their execution in conjunction with suspicious activities might indicate malicious intent.

   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used for managing Event Logs. This activity could indicate attempts to clear or modify event logs, an action often associated with obfuscating malicious activity.

2. **Application Logs:**

   - The entry from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` appears benign and related to the software protection platform service. Nothing suspicious is evident here.

3. **Summary:**

   - The combination of these activities: directory creation, the use of a zipped compression tool with a password, and the execution of command-line tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` in a short time span, suggests potentially malicious behavior.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` usage indicates attempts to manage or potentially clear logs, commonly associated with covering tracks in a compromise.

4. **Conclusion:**

   Based on the anomalies and potential indicators of ransomware-like activity observed in the logs, the resolution would be classified as:

   **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity highly indicative of malicious behavior, leveraging tools and commands that align with known threat behaviors.

5. **Guidance:**

   - Conduct a full incident response investigation to ascertain the extent of the compromise.
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further damage.
   - Analyze all related systems for similar behavior to identify potential lateral movement.
   - Consider conducting forensic analysis on the system to retrieve additional evidence.
   - Review and improve security measures to prevent future incidents, such as employing advanced endpoint detection and response solutions."
Search files of interest and save them to a single zip file (Windows),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4624:** This indicates a successful logon. Specifically, logon type 5 is associated with service start-up, which is typical for services that run under the SYSTEM account. The process ""services.exe"" is a standard Windows process.
- **Event ID 4672:** This indicates special privileges were assigned to a new logon, which is common for system accounts like NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. However, it's essential to monitor these privileges for potential abuse in other contexts.
- **Event ID 4616:** There are two entries of system time changes. Unauthorized time change attempts can indicate malicious activity, particularly in log tampering scenarios, but in this context, SYSTEM account performing it once could be a service adjustment.
- **Event ID 5379:** This event is related to credential manager operations. The failure of these credential read attempts (ReturnCode: 3221226021) might warrant further checking for possible brute force attempts or credential access issues.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **RestartManager Events:** The events are related to the start and processing of a session by RestartManager, typically benign as part of regular operations.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The PowerShell logs indicate a script execution attempting to search for and zip files with specific extensions. While PowerShell is powerful for legitimate administrative tasks, its misuse is a common vector for attacks. The activity of compressing files without further context (e.g., to where data is sent) could indicate exfiltration attempts.
  
### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Several processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, are viewed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The presence of process execution in rapid succession suggests that commands are being automated, possibly by a script. Combining this with the PowerShell script activity reveals potential exfiltration behavior.
- The process `powershell.exe` is used with a long command line, including parameters for zipping files, which aligns with the PowerShell log. Such behavior should be investigated further to understand the intent of file collection and potential exfiltration.
  
### System Log Analysis:
- **Time Service and Kernel-General Events:** There are normal system operations like the time being updated or service stack operations. These are usually benign.
- **Windows Update Events:** Indicate regular Windows updates, which are benign unless correlated with unusual downtime or administrative alerts.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the PowerShell activity combined with Sysmon logs shows potential signs of data collection and compression for exfiltration, which is a common tactic in various stages of cyber compromise. However, this behavior without additional context—such as external data transfers or known malicious actors—would not automatically qualify it as malicious on its own, but it certainly requires further investigation especially if there's no legitimate reason for these activities.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. Conduct an immediate review of the scripts executed on the machine and review the intent and necessity behind the PowerShell operations.
2. Check network traffic for any suspicious outbound connections or unknown data transfers around the time of the PowerShell script execution.
3. Re-evaluate user access controls and review audit logs for the account `admin_test` for any anomalies.
4. If this system is part of a larger network, extend the investigation to include lateral movement tracking and other connected systems.

Registry artefact when application use microphone,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows Event Logs, there are several entries worth discussing to determine whether they indicate malicious activity.

#### Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of System Commands:**
   - The logs show executions of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While execution of these commands by itself is not necessarily suspicious, their context is important to understand.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands can be used to enumerate information about the system and user environment, which might indicate reconnaissance if used inappropriately.

2. **Registry Modifications via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that modifies the registry related to `CapabilityAccessManager` is noteworthy:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\microphone\NonPackaged\C:\Windows\Temp\file.exe /v LastUsedTimeStart /t REG_BINARY /d a273b6f07104d601 /f
     ```
   - These registry modifications could suggest an attempt to manipulate application capabilities, specifically related to the microphone, which can be suspicious especially in combination with processes running from `Temp` directories.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security logs show time change events with `Event ID 4616`, indicating that the system time was altered.
   - Uncommon and frequent time adjustments can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-based security controls or logging.

#### Indicators of Compromise and Concerns:
- The presence of `cmd.exe` commands doing registry modifications combined with the manipulation of the time can be suspicious.
- Command-line arguments involving registry changes for application capabilities (`CapabilityAccessManager`) towards a microphone usage pattern are particularly concerning and hint toward potential stealth or privacy-compromising actions.
- The actions using `whoami.exe` and other reconnaissance-like tools could signal preliminary steps of a malicious actor trying to orient themselves on a compromised system.

### Assessment

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The registry modification behavior, especially concerning the microphone and the potential misuse of reconnaissance commands like `whoami.exe`, combined with system time changes, warrant further investigation. These activities are not typical for standard use and may indicate an attempt to obscure activities or alter system operation in favor of malicious intent.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify whether the user `admin_test` has authorized such actions or if the credentials have been compromised.
2. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Review other logs around the same timeframe for any concurrent suspicious activities.
   - Investigate any associated files within the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory, especially the `file.exe` mentioned in the logs.
3. **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior:**
   - Implement additional monitoring of registry changes and system command executions.
   - Pay special attention to commands associated with high integrity levels.
4. **System Time Audit:** Verify the source of time adjustments and ensure proper configurations to prevent manipulations.
5. **Security Measures:** Consider tighter controls and logging on sensitive operations like registry modifications and system time changes.

Following these steps will help ascertain if this suspicious behavior is part of a larger security threat or an isolated incident."
Recon information for export with Command Prompt,"Analysis of the logs provided reveals the following points of interest:

1. **Time Change Events:** 
   - The Security and System logs show EventID 4616 and EventID 1, respectively, which indicate changes to the system time. The time change events are typically not suspicious when performed by system services unless they appear frequently within short time frames, possibly indicating an attempt to alter the evidence of malicious activity or to manipulate time-dependent security measures.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - We observe numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs; however, its use can be suspicious if not expected. Massive logging operations with `conhost.exe` indicate likely interaction via the console.
   - A single instance of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` execution, which are benign, is observed. They show basic network and user information retrieval.
   - `cmd.exe` execution with a combination of commands involving `sc query`, `doskey /history`, `wmic`, and `tree` operations. Such use of command-line utilities collecting service, process, and directory information can be considered potentially suspicious as it suggests reconnaissance activity potentially by an attacker.
   
3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple logs detail activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appears to be searching for updates or registering server components, typically benign behavior for update services.
   - However, there's a notable instance of a process running from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUABD6.tmp\\`) which can be a vector for suspicious activities; however, without any additional anomalies associated specifically with this path or operation, it remains circumstantial.

**Assessment:**
The command execution shown in the logs, particularly the use of `cmd.exe` with commands querying system information, matches behaviors that could be indicative of an attacker performing reconnaissance on the system. The consistent admin-level access and execution of system commands notably increase the suspicion level. However, the Edge update activities seem standard and less suspicious in this context.

**Conclusion:** The analysis points towards SUSPICIOUS activities due to the execution of potentially reconnaissance command-line operations that could be aligned with malicious intent, although they do not on their own definitively confirm a compromise. Further investigation into the context of `cmd.exe` activity and potential external connections would be prudent to validate any threats.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The detected activity requires further investigation to determine if it is malicious or a result of legitimate administrative tasks."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With Rar,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
    - Event ID 4624 (Logon Successful): Indicates a successful system service logon using Logon Type 5, a typical occurrence when a service starts.
    - Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned): The SYSTEM account was granted a set of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` which, if misused, can lead to privilege escalation. 
    - Event ID 4616 (System Time Changed): This can be used by attackers to evade detection by altering timestamps. It's recorded twice but within normal variations for regular system operations like time synchronization.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
    - The invocation of several command-line processes (`cmd.exe`) by the user `admin_test` could be an indicator of anomalous behavior if not expected. 
    - Process creation for various tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with commands concerning `WinRAR` and file handling (`data.rar`) may indicate attempts to gather information or package files for exfiltration. These actions are often seen in suspicious activities.
    - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool to read event logs, might be performed by malicious actors to review logs for clearing or data retrieval.
   
3. **System and Application Logs:**
    - The logs mainly indicate standard operations like system time adjustments and the Windows Update process. The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and `SecurityHealthService` being triggered appears consistent with expected system updates and health checks.

### Assessment:

The elements of concern revolve around the command-line actions taken by the user `admin_test`, specifically the use of system utilities and commands that could facilitate data exfiltration or system manipulation (e.g., zipping files using `WinRAR` and possibly renaming extensions).

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - While there is no direct evidence of outright malicious activity, some events are anomalous and warrant further investigation, primarily the use of command-line tools and log-reading utilities by `admin_test` which are aligned with actions of interest from a security perspective.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of user `admin_test` and investigate the purpose of their activities.
   - Check system integrity and file modifications around the timestamps of the suspicious activities.
   - Monitor further actions from the account to ensure no data theft or system tampering.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Enforce strict execution policies and logging for command-line usage.
   - Consider employing security solutions to monitor and alert on suspicious privilege escalations and administrative activity."
Windows Screencapture,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the given machine, here's a detailed analysis of the findings based on the activity observed:

### Summary of Analysis:
1. **Windows Update Events**: The System log exhibits multiple `EventID 44` entries related to Windows Update activities (Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient), indicating the installation or update of several legitimate Microsoft components, such as Microsoft VCLibs, Microsoft.NET Native Frameworks, and Microsoft YourPhone. These entries reflect typical update procedures and do not indicate any malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution Analysis**:
   - **Sysmon Logs**: 
     - Legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `psr.exe`(Steps Recorder), and `whoami.exe` are prevalent, indicating routine administrative and system operations.
     - A command utilizing PowerShell for recording desktop activities is seen `psr.exe /start /output c:\\temp\\data_desktop.zip ...`. While this could be for legitimate debugging or workspace documentation purposes, it merits attention if not authorized.
     - Scheduled operations for Windows services such as `svchost.exe` and system utilities like `CompatTelRunner.exe` (Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry), `MusNotification.exe` (Update Notifications), and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations are also logged, implying regular system and application maintenance.

3. **Security and Authentication Events**:
   - **Security Logs**: Highlight logon activities, including those of `admin_test`, which are a part of the expected operations. There are entries for elevated privileges `EventID 4672`, detailing certain system processes holding administrative roles, identified through their `Se*Privilege` entries.
   - **EventID 4624**: Results reflect diverse remote and local login procedures with NTLM authentication, indicating accepted and verified access primarily through the SYSTEM user or an NT AUTHORITY user.
   - **Attempted Credential Access**: Repeated security auditing events (EventID 5379) tied to failed credential access could point to monitoring checks or failed opportunistic attempts without success.

4. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - **PowerShell Logs**: Point out instances of PowerShell usage for scripts tied with common administrative tasks. They do list operations interfaced through scripts managing system diagnostics and logs.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - Primarily involve the Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update services logging their operational checks and updates, typical of normal security service operations.

### Conclusion:
After thoroughly going through the various event logs, there is no definitive evidence of outright malicious activity. Most of the logs reflect typical update functioning, routine system processes, and standard authentication activities. However, a few elements, such as the notable usage of `psr.exe` and repetitive service interactions in Sysmon logs, could warrant a closer look to ensure they are benign as part of administrative tasks and not unauthorized operations.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities present typically align with legitimate system operations and updates. However, there's scope for further investigation into specific use cases like PowerShell commands and `psr.exe` utilization to conclusively rule out any inadvertent or unauthorized system usage. Further verification is recommended for unusual patterns, especially if changes weren't officially planned or executed by authorized admins."
Collect Clipboard Data via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**

The PowerShell event logs indicate the execution of a suspicious script via PowerShell. Key points of concern include:

- **Script Execution:** The command in these event logs involves downloading and executing a script (`Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`) from GitHub using PowerShell's `Invoke-Expression` (`IEX`) in combination with `Invoke-WebRequest` (`iwr`). This is commonly associated with malicious activities, where attackers download and execute scripts hosted on remote servers or public repositories.

- **Command Line Details:** The command line includes setting clipboard content and running a macro file with `Invoke-Maldoc`, which could be intended for further exploitation.

- **Host and Sequence Details:** All operations were executed on `powershell.exe` initiated on `Server002`, a potential indication of an automated or scripted attack.

**2. Security Logs:**

The security log data is empty, indicating a potential issue with logging configurations or intentional tampering, which can sometimes be the case in compromise scenarios.

**3. Sysmon Logs:**

Sysmon logs provide additional context to the PowerShell activities:

- **Process Creation:** The process creation events involve `powershell.exe`, and its child processes, indicating the spawning of console host (`conhost.exe`) processes and the utility `wevtutil.exe`, which may be trying to interact with event logs.

- **User Context:** The activities occurred under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating privileged access was used.

- **Correlation with PowerShell Logs:** The timestamps and the user match with those in the PowerShell logs, reinforcing the suspicion that the actions are coordinated.

**4. Application Logs:**

- **Edge Update Activity:** There are several log entries around Microsoft Edge updates that seem routine, showing the update service being stopped.

- **Software Protection:** Involves basic operations of the Software Protection service without any apparent anomalies.

**5. System Logs:**

The system logs are empty, which again could indicate a logging configuration issue or malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

### Assessment

Given the nature and content of the PowerShell logs and corroborating Sysmon logs, this activity strongly indicates malicious behavior:

- **Downloading and Executing Scripts:** The use of `IEX (iwr ...)` to fetch and execute a script from the internet without any validation is highly risky and a telltale sign of malware, especially when connected with clipboard operations and macro executions.

- **Log Inconsistencies:** Missing logs from the Security log and System logs might indicate log tampering or insufficient logging, which can be a sign of an attempt to cover tracks.

- **User and Privileged Context:** The activity being conducted under a presumably privileged user (`admin_test`) indicates that any potential compromise could have significant implications for the host and broader network security.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential spread of any malware or unauthorized access.
  
- **Conduct a Full Malware Scan:** Use specialized malware detection tools to perform an in-depth scan for known threats.

- **Review and Enhance Security Logging:** Ensure all logging mechanisms are active and properly forwarding records to central storage for analysis.

- **Investigate and Clean Accessible Scripts:** Check all files indicated in the logs and remove any unauthorized or unknown scripts.

- **Review Access Logs:** Investigate for any unusual access patterns or signs of external communication to command and control servers.

- **User Education:** Reinforce training on secure PowerShell usage and signs of malicious activity. 

After these measures, conduct a full forensics analysis to ascertain the scope and impact of this activity and plan recovery steps from potential infection or data breach."
Azure - Enumerate Azure Blobs with MicroBurst,"Based on the provided logs, here's an analysis of potential indicators of malicious activity or compromise:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script titled `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1` from a temporary user directory. Running scripts from temporary directories can be indicative of malicious activity, especially if not commonly conducted by regular operational processes. Specific attention should be given that this script attempts to interact with Azure Blobs, suggesting potential data enumeration or exfiltration.
   - The choice of location for both the script and the execution context (Context is by the user `admin_test`) in a temporary directory instead of a typical operational directory is suspicious.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - There's a notable event (EventID 4672) showing that `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege`. The `SeDebugPrivilege` allows processes to debug other processes, and if an unauthorized or suspicious account is obtaining these privileges, it could signal an attempt at privilege escalation.
   - Logon events (EventID 4624) with LogonType 3 suggest a network logon, which indicates remote access. The `admin_test` account logging on from a potentially external device `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication should be reviewed for legitimacy. 
   - The same `admin_test` account also appears in separate high privilege assignments and logins, which might denote consistent administrative access or it might be a result of credential compromise.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple executions of Edge Updates and installation-related binaries, which is generally benign but could possibly mask additional activities if overlapped by other malicious tasks.
   - Processes like `wsmprovhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were run in close sequence by `admin_test`, which often indicates reconnaissance commands trying to ascertain network or system details. These activities, in conjunction with other scripts launched, underline the suspicion.
   - The rapid sequence of launching binaries associated with administrative checks, such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, could be misappropriated for evasive tactics or environmental analysis.

**Assessment:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs show a high likelihood of suspicious activity, particularly around the `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1` script execution from a temp directory and the usage of user account `admin_test`. The excessive privileges obtained and multiple executions of reconnaissance commands further point towards potentially unauthorized actions rather than a benign management task.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1` script and determine if there is a business need for its execution.
   - Assess the security and authentication measures around `admin_test`, including any recent password changes or two-factor authentication logs.
   - Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for around the time of the suspicious logons to understand if there has been any unauthorized remote access.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Review and tighten permissions and privilege levels for accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
   - Conduct an audit of scripts being executed in atypical directories.
   - Develop stronger monitoring around PowerShell and other scripting engine executions."
Office365 - Email Forwarding,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the security, application, system, PowerShell, and Sysmon logs, there are indicators of potential malicious activity which warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a script attempting to create an inbox rule that forwards emails to an external address (""file_Operator@fakeemail.aq""). This type of activity is frequently associated with unauthorized email access and potential data exfiltration.

2. **Security Log Events**:
   - Event ID 4672 is noted, which logs when special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege) are assigned. The context indicates these were assigned during a SYSTEM logon which might be typical, but combined with other indicators, this calls for closer scrutiny.
   - Event ID 4624 represents a successful logon event of the SYSTEM account. This should be correlated with other activities to determine if it aligns with expected behavior.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events detail the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to clear event logs. This could potentially be used by an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.
   - Execution of PowerShell and Hostname application at high integrity levels with processes (such as `wsmprovhost.exe` and `powershell.exe`) that spawned these events deserves further investigation. The command-line arguments and actions taken are suspicious.
   
4. **Unusual Network Activity**:
   - Although not explicitly visible in these logs, the PowerShell activity coupled with SYSTEM logins and potential log clearing attempts could imply network reconnaissance or attempts to compromise other related systems.

5. **Application and System Updates**:
   - The logs show various application and system updates being processed. While normal in well-maintained systems, such updates need to be reviewed to ensure no anomalies or unplanned updates were pushed, possibly disguising other activities.

Given these observations, the recommended resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that appears suspicious, specifically the PowerShell script creating an email forwarding rule, and use of `wevtutil.exe` which may suggest that more investigation is needed. The context of these actions should be considered— if they align with the known behaviors of authorized users or automated processes, or if they suggest unauthorized access or nefarious actions.

**Guidance on Next Steps**:
- Perform a thorough review of the PowerShell scripts used, especially any related to email forwarding rules and connections to external services.
- Investigate the source and authorization of the commands associated with the SYSTEM account, particularly surrounding the time of the event entries.
- Review network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts corresponding with the suspicious activities.
- Verify the integrity and authenticity of recent Windows updates and any associated software changes within the corresponding event logs.
- Conduct a malware scan and review the permissions of users who have initiated similar processes to prevent unauthorized access."
Email Collection with PowerShell Get-Inbox,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the logs provided, the focus is on activities such as unusual process executions, specific command-line arguments indicative of potential compromise, and the overall context of system activity.

**Indicators of Interest:**

1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions**:
    - The logs show regular execution of PowerShell with a bypass execution policy and a specific script located in a temporary directory:
      - `""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {powershell -executionpolicy bypass -command \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\Get-Inbox.ps1\"" -file $env:TEMP\\mail.csv}""`
      - The use of the `-executionpolicy bypass` flag is suspicious as it allows scripts to run without the usual checks, and executing scripts from the temp directory is an unusual practice that could be indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
    - There are records of several processes being launched such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` without an apparent active administrative task sequence or system responsibility.
    - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` especially could be related to log manipulation or querying, an activity associated with efforts to obfuscate malicious actions.

3. **Edge Update Processes**:
    - Multiple EdgeUpdate processes running system-wide suggest legitimate software updates but could be suspect if not in line with normal usage times or more frequent than expected.
    - The update processes are running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system-wide operations but needs context regarding timing and frequency relevant to normal behavior.

**Assessment:**

- The execution of PowerShell with bypass policies to run scripts from a temporary folder is not standard for any known updates or typical administrative tasks and instead aligns with tactics used in various attack scenarios, such as potential phishing payloads or other forms of unauthorized script execution.
- While system utilities and EdgeUpdate activities could follow routine maintenance/updating, they could also serve as a smokescreen hiding malicious power user activity, especially when coupled with PowerShell behavior.

### Threat Assessment

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The event logs reveal potentially suspicious activities, warranting a deeper investigation. The significant factor is PowerShell's usage with execution policy bypass in combination with running scripts from a user's temp directory.
- While EdgeUpdate processes appear regular, combined with the timing, they raise questions about whether they are diverting attention or involvement in any unauthorized activity.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Contain and Analyze**: Secure the systems and further investigate the PowerShell logs, scripts in the temporary directories, and any network activity initiated by them.
   - **Review Patches/Updates**: Confirm if Edge updates match legitimate scheduled maintenance windows and if not, examine these processes further.

2. **System Hardening:**
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor scripts run on the network—implement application whitelisting if necessary.
   - Utilize tools to detect unusual process execution paths and privilege escalations.

3. **User Education/Procedure Audit:**
   - Ensure users or admins are aware of security policies regarding script executions, and audit any deviation for further context.

Continuing with these steps will help either validate benign behavior or adjust response to clearer indicators of compromise."
Windows Screen Capture (CopyFromScreen),"## Detailed Analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs exhibit the execution of a script that captures a screenshot of the virtual screen and saves it as ""data.png"" in the TEMP directory. This behavior is certainly suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity, particularly if this operation was unsolicited or unexpected in the environment. Screenshot capture is a common technique used by attackers to gather information about user activities and data on a compromised machine.

### Security Logs:
The security logs primarily indicate time change events carried out by SYSTEM processes. While these are not inherently suspicious, in combination with other indicators, such behavior could be part of a more extensive malicious campaign, especially if unscheduled or occurring frequently without authorization.

### Application Logs:
No unusual activities were found in the application logs. They contain routine system events like service updates and stops.

### Sysmon Logs:
- There were multiple entries related to the execution of known legitimate Windows binaries (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`). However, no abnormal command-line arguments or unexpected modifications were identified in these entries.
- The execution of `windowsPowerShell` with the same screenshot-taking command mentioned above is repeated here, confirming suspicious activity captured previously in the PowerShell logs.
- Legitimate updates for Microsoft Edge were also logged, showing that the system was undergoing regular maintenance or software updates, which on their own are benign.

## Assessment:
There is evidence within the Windows PowerShell logs of potentially malicious activity through a PowerShell script capturing screenshots. While some logs indicate benign updates on the system, no logs refute the PowerShell activity's suspicious nature.

## Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**: Investigate the origin and intent of the PowerShell script that captured the screen. Determine if it was a part of a legitimate administrative task or potential unauthorized access.
2. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the affected system, focusing on any further PowerShell activity and connections to external servers which might indicate data exfiltration.
3. **Incident Response**: Consider isolating the system from the network for further forensic analysis if it shows further suspicious behavior.
4. **Documentation**: Document all findings and actions taken as part of a potential incident handling process.

## Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain suspicious activity due to unauthorized PowerShell script execution that could be indicative of malicious behavior. Further investigation is warranted."
Automated Collection PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Command Line Usage with PowerShell**:
   - The executed PowerShell command is suspicious as it creates a directory in the system's temporary environment ($env:TEMP) named `data_powershell_collection` and recursively copies all `.doc` files into it. This behavior could indicate data exfiltration activity as it consolidates potentially sensitive document files into a single folder for further action.

2. **Unusual Execution of Common Utilities**:
   - **whoami.exe**: There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe` execution, which in general displays logged-on user information. While it can be a legitimate action, repeated executions in a short span might indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: The frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used for managing event logs, may suggest efforts to manipulate or cleanup logs, which are common post-exploitation activities intending to cover tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - There are numerous activities related to the update of Microsoft Edge, which seem benign and are part of a legitimate process for updating the browser.

4. **Integrity Level of Executions**:
   - Processes are running with high integrity levels, indicative of potential privilege escalation. This elevation could be leveraged by an attacker to execute malicious code with elevated permissions.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - Logs indicate changes in system time, which could be benign, or an attempt by an attacker to manipulate time-based event logs.

### Conclusion:

Based on the unusual PowerShell activity involving the collection of `.doc` files, repeated execution of command-line utilities (`whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`), and privileged execution level of these actions, the activities in the logs are concerning. 

The **PowerShell command** stands out as likely malicious activity that could indicate data exfiltration intent. 

Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The log entries strongly suggest an active compromise with potential data exfiltration.

### Guidance:

Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winrar,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, certain activities raise concerns about potential malicious behavior. Below is an analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Command Line Execution:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c if not exist \""%%programfiles%%/WinRAR/Rar.exe\"" (exit /b 1)` and `\""cmd.exe\"" /c mkdir .\\tmp\\victim-files & cd .\\tmp\\victim-files & echo \""This file will be encrypted\"" > .\\encrypted_file.txt & \""%programfiles%/WinRAR/Rar.exe\"" a -hp\""blue\"" hello.rar & dir`. The latter command creates a directory, writes a file, compresses it with a password, and lists the directory contents. Considering the context and the use of encryption, this sequence can be associated with ransomware or preparatory activity for data exfiltration.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes seem legitimate as they are part of Microsoft Corporation's updating mechanism. However, the context of other suspicious activities should be considered to determine if these are used as camouflage for malicious actions.
   
3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows utility to manage event logs, suggests potential log tampering or attempts to clear or export logs to cover tracks.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level indicate potentially sensitive operations that might require administrative privileges. The creation and encryption of files under this context raise concerns.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Security log Event ID `4672` shows special privileges were assigned to the `SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system services but noteworthy in highlighting elevated privileges during the suspicious activities.

### Conclusion:

- **Identified Threats/Risks:**
  - The combination of file encryption commands, potential log manipulation, and administrative-level process execution indicates suspicious activities which might be prelude or part of a ransomware attack or data exfiltration campaign.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential damage or propagation if it is part of a network.
   - Conduct integrity checks and review antivirus/endpoint protection logs for further indicators of compromise or alerts concerning the involved executables.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Run comprehensive malware scanning on the system.
   - Analyze created files, especially encrypted or suspiciously altered files, for signs of ransomware or other malicious payloads.
   - Review firewall and network logs to identify any unusual outbound communications that might represent data exfiltration or command and control activities.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Preserve event logs and any other relevant data for further forensic investigation.
   - Summon forensic and incident response specialists if in-house capability is insufficient to determine the full scope of the compromise.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of suspicious activities such as unauthorized command executions that appear to be creating and encrypting files, the possibility of log tampering, and privileged process creation confirms the presence of malicious intent or a compromise warranting a MALICIOUS resolution. Immediate response and in-depth investigation are recommended."
using device audio capture commandlet,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here's an analysis of the activity:

### Sysmon Log:
- Extensive process creation events (EventID 1) show instances of HOSTNAME.EXE, conhost.exe, whoami.exe, and wevtutil.exe being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
- Multiple PowerShell instances with command-line executions involving scripts or cmdlets such as ""WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet"" could suggest possible suspicious activity if not expected in regular operations. 
- PowerShell activity, particularly when not known or documented as part of routine administrative tasks, should be scrutinized further. However, no direct indication of a reverse shell or unauthorized script execution is apparent without additional context.
  
### PowerShell Log:
- Numerous PowerShell provider events (EventID 600, 400) indicate PowerShell sessions initiating and stopping normally. While this doesn’t immediately signal malicious activity, it coincides with Sysmon EventID 1 records, showing PowerShell command execution.
  
### Security Log:
- Time change events (EventID 4616) show the adjustment of system time via svchost.exe, similar to the System log. No privilege escalation or unauthorized access events observed.

### Overall Assessment:
- **PowerShell Activities:** The use of PowerShell with specific command lines might not be inherently malicious. However, the specific command “WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet” requires validation to verify if it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or scripts deployed in your environment.
- **General Behavior:** The majority of the logs showcase typical system process activity (e.g., svchost.exe, whoami.exe) and administrative interactions. Unless the PowerShell script or command executed is known to be unauthorized, the logs resemble administrative or system maintenance routines.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activity that warrants further investigation, especially focusing on the PowerShell command usage and its origin. Validation with administrators or the user associated with ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" is recommended to confirm the legitimacy of these actions.
  
#### Guidance:
- Verify the origin and purpose of the PowerShell command executed.
- Consult with the relevant users or system administrators to assure these actions align with routine or scheduled tasks.
- Consider implementing stricter monitoring or alerts for specific PowerShell activities, especially those run from non-standard directories or with unusual arguments."
Windows Recall Feature Enabled - DisableAIDataAnalysis Value Deleted,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, the following observations and analysis are made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior in Logs:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events are indicating registry modifications using commands executed via `powershell.exe`. Specifically, a registry key related to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI` was added and deleted.
   - The command involves altering a registry value and then removing it, which can be indicative of attempts to change system policies or configurations temporarily. While registry editing is not inherently malicious, when conducted via PowerShell without clear justification, it can be suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of execution of `reg.exe` for adding and deleting registry keys, as triggered by PowerShell commands. This confirms the registry modification activity tracked in PowerShell logs.
   - The processes were executed by a user with a high integrity level (`SERVER002\admin_test`), which could indicate privilege misuse if not conducted for legitimate reasons.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The logs indicate expected operations, such as updates for Microsoft Edge. These activities are performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for system-level tasks and lacks clear malicious indicators.
   - The presence of time synchronization events in System logs suggests routine system maintenance tasks.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Time synchronization via the Windows Time Service, as logged here, is standard behavior. The non-administrative account ""LOCAL SERVICE"" conducted these operations, appearing benign.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
- The PowerShell and Sysmon events concerning the registry are noteworthy. While they do not definitively prove malicious activity, they embody behavior that merits further investigation due to registry editing via automated scripts without discernible purpose in this context.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The activities around registry modification using PowerShell and `reg.exe` are peculiar, particularly without associated legitimate activity logs explaining why these changes are necessary. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether this activity stems from potentially unauthorized scripts or tools running on the system. Conduct a thorough review of user actions and system changes during the same timeframe to correlate these activities with authorized administrative actions. If these actions are unexplained, they could indicate the presence of potentially harmful automated scripts."
Zip a Folder with PowerShell for Staging in Temp,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have performed the analysis as follows:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell logs indicate the use of the `Compress-Archive` command. The command is used to compress a folder from the ""AppData\Local\Temp\"" directory and save it as a zip file at the user's temp environment path. This activity itself is not inherently malicious; it could be part of a normal backup, archiving, or administrative task. However, given that it manipulates data in the temporary directories, it warrants further exploration to ensure it aligns with expected user or automated tasks on the server.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- The Sysmon logs show the execution of various legitimate Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell. All these processes are executed under the context of a user named `admin_test`.
- The presence of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times could suggest log manipulation attempts, but without additional context or a user's behavioral baseline, this might not be definitively malicious.

### System Log Analysis
- The System logs show time adjustments executed by the `svchost.exe` process. Time adjustments can be suspicious as they might be used to mask other malicious activities by altering timestamps. However, they are also a part of normal Windows time synchronization processes, especially since it appears to use the legitimate `time.windows.com`.

### Application Log Analysis
- There's an entry for the Software Protection Platform Service, which is involved in licensing and activation tasks on Windows. The log's content in itself doesn't provide evidence of malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis
- Logs show a timestamp change with a Process ID related to `svchost.exe`. This corroborates the system-level time changes observed. Again, this is likely consistent with time synchronization processes unless seen in suspicious context.

### Conclusion
The logs reviewed do not conclusively indicate malicious activity. The behavior observed, while having elements that might warrant further scrutiny (e.g., time changes, usage of `wevtutil.exe`, and file compression in temp paths), do not definitively point to compromise based on the data available. However, since there are potential elements that could be used during a typical attack (such as log manipulation or time distortion), it is prudent to flag this as an area for further review.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that may need further investigation. In particular, verify whether the PowerShell compression tasks and the repeated time changes align with the expected operational patterns for user `admin_test` and the server operations. Additionally, ensure the system has up-to-date security patches and review for known vulnerabilities related to observed activities."
Registry artefact when application use webcam,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, certain entries suggest potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **Sysmon Logs (Command Execution):**
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, executing with registry modifications related to webcam permissions. This kind of registry modification by scripts or `cmd.exe` is a common indicator of script-based persistence mechanisms, which are often used in malware.

2. **Registry Entries:**
   - The command line of `cmd.exe` executing `reg.exe` indicates attempts to set registry values specific to webcam usage. This could be benign in a controlled environment but warrants suspicion especially if unauthorized, as it suggests potential attempts to manipulate access control permissions without user consent.

3. **Edge Updates:**
   - The repeated instances of various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes executing around the same time raise questions about whether these are legitimate updates or if something has manipulated the Edge update mechanism as a way to sidestep security controls. However, given the associated paths and the system integrity level, they likely relate to genuine updates.

4. **Sysmon Logs (Process Execution):**
   - `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` multiple executions within a short time might indicate reconnaissance activities, typical in the lateral movement stage of an attack. However, these tools can also be used for legitimate purposes.

5. **Behavioral Pattern:**
   - The chain of processes indicates potential scripting activity. The use of `cmd.exe`, alongside registry modifications, although not immediately flagging as malicious, suggests behaviors that align with attacker methodologies for system reconnaissance or maintaining persistence.

Based on the analysis, while there's no smoking gun confirming 100% malicious activity, the evidence points to potential scripting activities that manipulate system components unnaturally. This indicates that the activity observed is not normal for typical user behavior and thus falls under a category needing thorough verification to ensure authenticity and intent, especially concerning any policy changes or unauthorized script executions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct further investigation into the source of the registry changes associated with webcam permissions.
- Verify with stakeholders or the IT department if there are known scripts or admin tasks that explain this behavior.
- Monitor network traffic for any exfiltration attempts possibly linked with the suspected activity.
- Examine detailed user history and associated scheduled tasks, if available, for deeper insight into these process executions.
- Consider implementing stricter access controls and logging to monitor similar behavior in the future."
Azure - Scan for Anonymous Access to Azure Storage (Powershell),"Let's analyze the logs for any indicators of malicious activity.

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616**: This event confirms that the system time has been changed, with `svchost.exe` executing as the LOCAL SERVICE. Time adjustments can be suspicious if unauthorized, but in this case, there's no indication that this was done outside of normal activity.

### System Log
- **Event ID 24 & 1**: These logs pertain to time changes without any unusual reasons. The time source being synchronised with `time.windows.com` indicates normal timekeeping.
- **Event ID 35**: NTP synchronization with `time.windows.com`, appears normal.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs reveal the use of `invoke-webrequest` to access `https://dataTest2.blob.core.windows.net//`. The script handles exceptions and logs responses to a local file. Usage of PowerShell scripts to access resources and handle responses requires attention as it can be a technique used in data exfiltration or reconnaissance. However, the content itself doesn't explicitly indicate malicious actions.

### Sysmon Log
- **Event ID 5 & 1 Process Creations**: Multiple processes were started on `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` can potentially be a sign of log clearing and execution of scripts, respectively. However, `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` usage appears typical for checking user status and network settings.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` aligns with updates related to Microsoft Edge, attributed to SYSTEM-level processes. 

### Application Log
- The ""Service stopped"" log tied to `edgeupdate` indicates services related to Edge updates which may be part of the usual update cycle.

### Overall Assessment
1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell activity stands out due to a network request being made and the response being handled. This suggests potential usage beyond typical administrative actions, leaning towards data collecting scripts. This requires further examination.
2. **Sysmon Activity**: Execution of utility tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) by an admin user isn't inherently suspicious without further context of their specific commands.
3. **Edge Update**: Observing Microsoft's Edge and its update mechanisms confirms typical behavior unless anomalies related to it are noticed elsewhere.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs reflect activity that needs further investigation, especially the PowerShell script usage. Despite the absence of overt malicious indicators, the context around PowerShell sessions and potentially associated network activity needs more scrutiny to ensure no intended or accidental compromise is occurring.

### Next Steps
- Conduct a deeper examination of the PowerShell script and verify with the script author (if possible) for legitimate uses.
- Investigate network activity related to `dataTest2.blob.core.windows.net` for any unauthorized data flows.
- Monitor subsequent system log trends for patterns and any unauthorized changes or access.

This preliminary analysis suggests vigilance and deeper exploration to confirm the context and legitimacy of activities flagged as suspicious."
Automated Collection Command Prompt,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

After reviewing the provided logs, here are the findings:

#### Application Logs:
1. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (Software Protection Platform Service)**: This is a routine log often related to license validation and the activation state of Windows. Logs at this level of detail (ID 16384) indicate normal operation of the service.
2. **EdgeUpdate**: These entries are associated with normal update operations for Microsoft Edge. The entries like ""Service stopped"" are common during routine software updates.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4624 (An Account was Successfully Logged On)** and **4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon)**: These events indicate successful logons. The system shows logons with high privileges typically related to local system accounts, and no unknown or unexpected user account is noted.
2. **Multiple 5379 events (Credential Validation with Return Code 3221226021)**: These entries indicate failed credential validation, but the return code `3221226021` suggests no credentials were returned or validated, which often occurs in benign contexts side-by-side with certain repetitive automated processes.
3. **Event ID 4798 (A user's local group membership was enumerated)**: This log indicates the enumeration of group membership, which is common in administrative operations and does not show any new user additions or unexpected changes.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation and Termination Events**: Include common system processes like `conhost.exe`, `CMD.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `findstr.exe`. Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wmiprvse.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and others show regular and expected utility operations/maintenance tasks.
2. **Microsoft Edge Update Operations**: Repeated appearances of Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) indicate regular maintenance and update actions.

#### Indicators of Potential Concern:
1. **Presence of Scripts and Commands**: Several command-line tools (`CMD.exe`, `findstr.exe`) executed commands that seem part of data inventory or extraction (`mkdir` and `copy`). However, this could also just be part of legitimate backup or system check activities if managed by authorized personnel.
2. **Repeat Operations**: The repetition of credential checks and Edge update operations might initially suggest automation scripts, however, given their context and lack of unexpected outcomes or malicious destinations, they don’t conclusively indicate malicious intent.

### Assessment and Conclusion
The logs predominantly show routine system operations and benign processes with some noise typically associated with regular system and software maintenance routines.

- **Benign**: Based on the patterns observed and lack of evidence pointing towards compromised states or data exfiltration, these logs reflect regular maintenance and expected utility activities. There are no clear indicators of compromise, unauthorized access, or undeniably malicious behavior.

### Recommended Guidance
1. **Routine Monitoring**: Maintain routine monitoring and audits of similar activities, keeping an eye on permissions and keeping software up-to-date to decrease opportunities for malicious exploitation.
2. **User Awareness**: Train users on recognizing unusual activity and reporting potential security issues.
3. **Logging Anomalies**: Future occurrences of similar logs with different context or parameters should be thoroughly reviewed to rule out actual threats.

Resolving with conclusion: **BENIGN**."
